And that is the extent of this
amendment.
Mr speaker Mr speaker did you
ask me that question yes I did
Representative Montoya.
Yes thank you
Thank you Mr chairman
Thank you Mr speaker generating
so I understand what you're
trying to do here is take out
that.
Two percent.
who are looking to get their
voting rights restored as soon
as a main prison are those are
those the the most egregious.
One for a danger to society to
make them go through the
current.
two percent of the most heinous
crimes this those are the ones
that I've.
And I think the risks is
Mr speaker and the lady
there was a very heinous crime
create that was a committed.
Several years ago
Little girl and she was eleven
years old I think and when she
was.
The right.
So that that person.
Who committed that crime the the
mother who is complicit and then
the boyfriend.
If either one of those persons
were to get out of jail after
being convicted of that felony.
With that person
from satellite I'm getting
feedback here I'm sorry yes they
would.
Ording to divide the bill is
currently written yes their
rights would be reinstated.
who made a mistake.
so this person who made this
mistake.
for a.
voting rights restored.
Mr speaker gentleman from San
Juan no.
Of.
I understand that these people
parole officer get the paperwork
in place for the do present it
to the county clerk's office
then they do get their rights
reserved but no.
I would say that the folks of
New Mexico.
Do not want them to have their
voting rights reinstate.
And
and they were property crimes
mostly and felony property
crimes that would mean robbery
this is the most heinous of
criminals it is not for these
that might have made a mistake
of having to do with the
property right violation or
Thank you Mr speaker and
generally I I remember the
little girl's name I think her
name is Victoria martens yes it
All I'm seeing in in the
amendment that you're bringing
as an exclusion for that type of
the criminal not not the.
The good natured and robbers
and.
And and generally we're we're.
Obviously wanting people who can
reenter society.
year to that
makes it easier for them get
work and and maybe not even have
to report to their employer that
they serve time in prison
Purpose
Justice that that certain
murders rapists and and and the
final checks of the sex
offender's child sex offenders
but this there's no requirement
I think maybe we want to do that
for folks who are as we stated
earlier and in the state did
something dumb I I don't know
how we can look at.
This amendment I am for the life
of me I can't understand how
anyone.
Would want to call this
we're not we're not saying we're
gonna restore their ability to
get a gun.
Way and I I believe voting to be
gentle lady I I fully.
Support your amendment I think
other people who were offended
they're doing their senses were
generated if we look at those
folks and and and give them
something that they've not heard
back yet so the speaker gently I
Mr speaker on the amendment yeah
we I'm dealing with a couple of
Thank you Mr speaker allegedly
from Travis thank close Mr
speaker I do yield.
Thank you Mister speaker
gentlelady from Travis
individuals from voting they
just have to go through the same
bureaucratic process that that
that folks do today.
It's just Mr speaker gentleman
with their parole officer they
have to stay in good standing
they have to submit the
paperwork to the county clerk's
office that that process is then
verified and then their rights
earlier on in the debate yes
this particular bill for
somebody that has.
May really messed up for one
sexual assault.
To society.
In New Mexico want those people
to have their very sacred voting
Mr speaker.
Anybody else that right now has
been released from prison they
they are going through that
process.
Or maybe something that they had
done early on in life you know
that they have.
Paid their debt these are
people.
We sure that exact same
sentiment but we have to put our
hatred and animosity aside for
principal.
Good public policy.
president was one of the most
progressive thing the federal
government is done in twenty
five years as it relates to.
Criminal justice reform because
it was done under the guise of
thank over forming the voted to
restore voting rights to those
that had blemishes on their
record.
and and ties to family and or
the community.
The folks you're
referring to are so anti social
in the past.
of the forty Martin that's a
that's a huge.
I I.
Of the my brain can stretch that
far but I but I appreciate the
attempt.
these of the files and all these
people that we hate to go into
the county clerk's office to go
back to their probation
department to go into and we do
I mean so so there really is no
frankly if they're out of prison
and something's wrong
something's wrong with our
system we adequately.
On the DA's offices are in our
police and and do no good
creating more work for DO see
more work for the county parks
more work for for the secretary
of state for a tiny tiny class
of people that.
You know when we can just
continue to punish people
because we.
As we hate them you know this is
contrary to public safety and I
would ask that you.
Mister speaker July from Travis
but we all know how voting
rights got taken away from folks
will know where they got taken
away from folks and we all know
future let's follow our voters
in Florida and let's restore
voting rights to those who wish
to see thank you thank you Mr
speaker.
Further debate on the amendment
Ladies.

hard time hearing the
Thank you can you hear me now.
Comes in and out so do your best
to talk right into the Mike if
you don't mind.
know from back will come back to

And they're released on

The gentle lady can they had to
help me out here.
And
maybe.
Can be a school teacher.
And one of our schools.
The.
The argument that.
This is.
Different.
And other otherwise have is
just.
Not factual is that correct.
Mr speaker you're exactly right
Corks of a parental rights.
those felons those people
without the record.
Mr speaker gentleman yes you're
exactly right.
That.
Process.
a fellow.
Being released.
On probation.
All.
With that said I believe.
It comes and stands for on order
thank you very much.
Thank you there is further
debate I'd like to try to go
back to the representative from

Representative Pettigrew try
again which is who we can hear
you.
try one more time we'll go to
Representative Lord.
Thank you Mr speaker can
everyone hear me it's my first
Is a kind lady from shop.
Chavez county going to get it
right are you.
Mister speaker I yield thank you
all of the rights back it's a
first step in the right
direction it's not that they get
everything back on once I just
wanted to address that and that
is that they get everything back
And that they should have some
of the rates restored but not
all of them this is actually is
and part of law is a morality
issue so we're dealing with the
morality of the entire bill.
alert recently what happened
potential we're docked.
Mr speaker gentle lady yes it is
it was if today's Thursday it
horrific case that that makes me
sick to my stomach about
Victoria martens involved Fabian
Gonzales in Gonzales just
recently helped his girlfriend
So my point being Mr chair and
representative.
And.
And you look at the morality of
this.
rights back they did not get all
the rights back to only which is
very important.
So in this case I agree with you
a hundred percent on your
amendment that if somebody has
with you and thank you for
allowing me a few moments SB.
Thank you.
Is there for a little bit on the
gentleman from San Juan.
Thank you Mr speaker thinker in
only a couple questions for
clarification.
Make sure I understand your
amendment.
Of many of our most vulnerable
certificate about for example
child abuse.
is that a fair understanding of
your equipment.
these type of phones from ever
being.
Register to vote in fact I think
there's another process I was I
can still apply to be registered
understanding then that really
what this amendment Senator
Campos is just preclude the
secretary of state from
Mr speaker gentleman from San
Juan yes this at the secretary
of state of.
What what you're talking about
the.
And again Mister speaker these
are.
These are the rates that are
being stripped by this amendment
you might even consider have a
bench trial the most of these
offenses are from.
During the repairs or even a a
plea agreement and that
Okay and Mister speaker the the
language in this amendment is is
neutral in that it doesn't apply
to any particular race or
socioeconomic status from the
correct.
goes on note this is.
If you have been convicted of
child abuse rape murder or
sexual assault.
Is Jennifer St Representative.
Regular.
Thank.
Speaker I yield to the gentleman
Thank you Mr speaker gently
would you please yield.
Mister speaker I yield.
In looking over the Gen
for the really that was
mentioned by Representative
Maestas Alabama Iowa and
Delaware you know for states
that are that are quite diverse
you're doing is is is good
practice for and they.
They made sure they had some
limitations I would cover ninety
eight percent of the folks that.
A young man is a change the key
he's in mind in my neighborhood
this and this bill I mean in AP
rate instead society he had
pretty bad experience in jail
you the witness some bad things
that
were Alabama.
I would Delaware including in
some some pretty.
Pretty safe restrictions.
Is that right gentle lady Mr
For these particular.
Gregis.
Criminals could not
especially yours overseas if
somebody else hears about that
they have.
Served time in jail completed
their.
their rights reinstated because
sometimes the crimes that they
have done.
It was a it was a.
As serious as what I'm trying to
Because I want the integrity of
our each and every person's
right to vote protected the did
these people that have done
followed all as specs of the law
therefore the that's what is
particular amendment forward.
It will fall in line with
Florida Alabama Delaware and.
You know hundreds of years if
you break the law and it is a
felony you have to pay the price
citizens of New Mexico Mr
chairman and gentle lady
I thank you have a great support
and in our communities that
Do this for the debate the
gentle.
Representative Chasey.
So Mr speaker lady from Travis
here here the problems I have
with your amendment and I want
to say first of all I don't
And horrified at the deaf
Victoria martens.
And in fact we had testimony
There is nothing that can.
Ever make up for what was done
to those children.
So.
Former felons
a.
Register to vote that has been
our law and our policy.
What with criminal justice
And try to find less expensive
but still effective ways to
punish others so this
Representative Eli S. as the
German formerly else that are
unlikely to be out of prison
anyone.
So.
Very.
Oops and and so forth would not
be allowed to register if for
example
Let's say he was.
Whose father did three.
The felony child abuse.
And.
And the down have all been
reunited so I mean she was
someone who was driven to very
time as there as the attorney
for the children before I felt
that that was the right thing to
now a tax payer in working and
raising five children.
In our society but you're
amendment doesn't differentiate
between any type of criminal
this inability to register to
vote.
I think the amendment is infirm
in its drafting because you're
time in prison and I think you
may be aiming at people who are
unlikely to ever get out.
So I I just want to say I I
does twenty years through of
what we have
used in the state and on it
doesn't it doesn't accomplish
could be in there it's just
going to create
Mask condition.
If the criminal law one proved
defense attorneys and people
Mr Mr Chairman a gentle lady
from Bernalillo right now.
Every field of that is released
of their probation before their
rights are.
Reinstated.
And so whenever you're saying
changing laws of twenty years
of New Mexico we're gonna go
ahead let these people that have
come in convicted of child abuse
rape murder or sexual assault
think those particular criminals
that have been convicted of
those crimes I just stated.
Do you need to go through the
that been through to a visiting
with the.
As psychiatrist if you want to
call it that to make sure that
you were talking about the
gentleman that is now.
you're telling him.
We're gonna let these other
people that have been convicted
of the same crimes you were that
they get their rights reinstated
Areas for the generating from
the Representative Cadena.
Mr speaker I Mister speaker I
yield to the lady from the
Indiana.
Thank you Mr speaker gentle lady
improved public safety can you
walk me through that Mr speaker
gentle lady.
Mr speaker as I stated before
the the integrity of ever
creating convicted of these
egregious crimes to be able to
get out of prison and
immediately vote.
Mister speaker the.
Mr speaker gentle lady I
appreciate that but I am asking
a different question if we are
categorizing does that have
receiving phony conviction serve
public safety if we might even
agree that that these criminals
have have done something heinous
in nature how are these two how
this amendment connected to
improving public safety are
Why you would public safety be
affected.
You too can you answer that one
for me.
Mr speaker gentle lady thank you
neighbors and our yeah he does a
grandmother's safer in the
communities that we call home
every day my concern is that
this amendment well targeting
constitutional right to vote has
nothing to do with public safety
so I'm I'm just trying to
understand if we're going to if
we're going to call these people
out and say that we're willing
keeping the rest of us safer for
that but I I'm not sure yet then
what the intention of of this
amendment would be.
If not to improve public safety
I've helped several people that
have had felony convictions that
has tried to make their life
better by following all the
Charged with the what upon their
release from prison.
The they have strived to get
back the right to vote.
soon as they get out they're
going to get to vote so what
does that mean to your
grandmother spent.
Is she going to feel the same
child right without proving to
society that the is a viable
voter in the state.
I'm just real real concern thank
someone is released from prison
and that sentence include the
probation and fined and or
parole terms that if those terms
are violated they likely will go
So if I follow the argument of
this amendment Mr speaker gentle
lady.
In trying to or or proposed in
amendment we're trying a certain
folk folk people's people that
do have a felony conviction who
have served their time that they
should be left out even though
they've served their time.

a gentle lady.
I will wrap with the I have
serious concerns that we would
vote and others not beyond the
statutory infrastructure we
already have laid out that
should be a separate bill that
should be a well thought out
policy discussion that should be
I I fundamentally believe that a
right to democracy means that we
don't get to pick and choose who

propaganda spewing across the
country I would have imagined
that that kind of propaganda
We're not fundamentally changing
any worse lying across.
Matter Mr speaker and gentle
lady so that people who have
served their time.
Mr speaker gentle lady I would
ask my colleagues on the house
floor today.
We don't need to to fit or swing
or fall to the sort of baited
the purpose of our criminal
legal system is if someone goes
to court is charged convicted
Silvercity and then comes out.
sure that we're creating a
second class of citizens and and
undercutting the rights of some
New Mexicans to vote basically
undercutting the New Mexico
constitution that we all say
about how we might compromise
people voting moving forward.
Thank you.
All right there is further
debate Mr speaker order state
into a debate about racism and.
Just.
In childhood in committee to say
to the purpose of the bill
Mr speaker have trouble this
about whether rapists murderers
and child molesters a.
will are continually tried to
stay on the line of the bill and
I and I I'm I'm tired of the
single time I'm on the line
every time I
and.
To say on behalf of the
minorities and poor people in my
community and celebrate with
the fact that the people talking
about today are convicted felons
that we're not trying to take
rights away this call we're
something away based on racist
motives and at the last.
And I don't I think I'm exempt I
have a race card in my pocket
that has been my driver's
stick to the substance of the
debate thank you Mr speaker
there is further debate we're
gonna try again the gentleman
from we one last time
device and
Excellent internet quality I
really don't understand but you
know
the bill
The
lady from Travis county all.
Mister speaker I yield to the
gentleman from the county.
pursuant to the last set of
questions.
Please explain to me exactly how
your amendment violates our
Mr speaker if the gentleman from
Lee County would give me a few
minutes to get out my
constitution and go to that
section analysts TRD has it
the amendment I'm questioning
I'm I'm you your just challenge
Mr speaker gentle lady was just
mind could potentially Mr
speaker violate our
constitution.
But my point being with this is
Mr speaker donating
we didn't create a second class
and systems in action occurred a
right a murder sexual assault or
any other combination of those
four items in in this amendment
right here's specifically says
be a fair statement.
The gentle lady.
Mr.
Sorry about that Mr speaker
Mr speaker you know of a prior
comment specific to this we
don't get to pick and choose who
votes and and I would agree with
that statement very specifically
we don't choose that.
This amendment very specifically
in my mind.
Sister and says wait a minute
you chose to make this decision.
off and get a ride to the would
that be a fair statement Mr
speaker with IBM for statements
about gentle lady.
Mr speaker gentleman from Lee
can say or we can draw
conclusions from is anybody that
is close but is opposing this
amendment may be willing to just
and I don't ask one final
question.
The gentle lady Mr speaker
gentle lady I'm a very to the
bill multitude tons of right
not what I read I read
specifically and act relating to
elections repelling cancellation
of the funding registration
after felony conviction amending
in my and to my knowledge
address public safety.
So what time did we start the
public safety debate today Mr
speaker I am gentle lady.
often chased and sometimes that
does happen that you're exactly
for right it is not mentioned
anywhere in the bill that was
from Travis county so I I just I
don't want to lose this all
together for the for the people
that are watching
This this this amendment
actually takes people that are.
weren't Santo institute so they
were convicted so they may well
push to make this.
And and so any one of those for.
are there are productive
capability back into society
this is not about public safety
this is about making and this is
Mr speaker gentleman from Lee
County you're exactly right I do
agree with that.

That was being.
Exercised over on the Senate

Mason's number six
Mr speaker the gentle lady
I wanna make sure that I'm
putting this amendment into the
proper context as we evaluate
whether we're going to proceed
you to vote in elections is that
right that your understanding as
well Mr speaker generating.
everybody gets to come in on
buses about stuff like that but
I do really hope that the
integrity of the registered
voters.
many many years that Mr speaker
yes I do feel that of.
The integrity of our vote is
very important and it is each
that are that are of age and are

licenses done that did deployed
which people say you serve your
time is when you're about.
And Mr speaker gentlelady we in
that when people are out the
punishment phase ends and
probation and parole is not
about punishment probation and
parole is about helping people
them get back in touch with
family and back in touch with
friends to provide positive
need helping them give us access
to educational opportunities we
do all these things Mr speaker
gentle lady because of the is
there is a common phrase you
speaker generating as we want to
do things both while they're in
prison and while they're on
probation or parole so that they
have a a a fair shake a good
chance a good opportunity.
All right so you know we want
people to come back out as I
said people will be everyone is
in prison now is gonna be
standing next to the grocery
after they've been released and
as I said probation pros are a
punishment it's about all the
things that we believe help

best we can with available
budgets to have probation and

opportunities and meaningful
Mr speaker generating one of the
things that we hear and the
committees that deal criminal
justice bills.
Is it a more things that can be
offered to help people
the less likely it is to receipt

And in my view.
Eight eight eight wonderful
opportunity for people to feel
participate in the most
important thing in our

them in government.
why someone who
may have committed a third

going to
turn the other cheek and move
forward we're gonna exercise
that great.
enough I'm using internet.
And that is you know I I don't I

don't know the faces and
everyone in this chamber but for
those of us who share the
End of someone's been in prison

times so when has.
Paid the price for heinous acts

Seems to me that the values of
our society that we want people
to re integrate we want to give
welcomed back into society that
is huge fees Mr speaker gentle
lady.
We should all want.
People released from prison and
on probation and parole to feel
member of that community Mr
speaker generally.
We don't want people to feel
like that a prisoner ostracized
they can't ever participate with
others in the community.
We want to be smart right we
want to have probation and
parole to make sure that we're
not taking unnecessary risks
speaker generally that they are.
Are going to be complying with
the rules and and and being a
contributing member of our
society.
In my view does nothing other
than help them feel that they

And I don't think this house of

part in making it harder to vote
Unfortunately Mr speaker

think it makes it it restricts
the franchise it makes it harder

And you know it if we have not

Our first meeting together can
you hear the question.
If you can help me understand
this Mr speaker is.
If I am currently in prison I'm
not permitted to vote is that
correct.
and you're in prison you're not
permitted to while you're there.
Okay thank you Mr speaker and
One answer but I'm actually in
this country we never
disenfranchised part.
Until the eighteen seventy.
So after during reconstruction
after the civil war.
The franchise was taken away
there was concern about the
freed slaves voting.
So we that was removed to
restate I believe that number
the United States citizens so
The reconstruction era led to
the decision.
why why don't we the vote even
while a felon is is currently

Thank you Mr speaker.
If I understand.

And so I guess I don't
understand why we don't just
give on the right to vote right
now I wonder incarcerated if it

Thank you Mr speaker and and up.
Happens when the release of
their being released from the
correctional facility is a
exists in in current statutory
law all.
And specifically.
Transaction thirty one dash
thirteen to one.
being reinstated to vote again
is that correct.
And so here first the change.
That's how the law has been for
twenty years.
So that has proven to be very
cumbersome.
This is hard on the.
felons who actually have to be
very painful.
Having barriers and are unable
to vote.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Incarceration time that would
include from the terms of any
appropriations that would extend
after release from
incarceration.
may actually still have terms of
my probation test bill is that
correct.
Yes and I think that is correct
Mr speaker and gentleman.
punishment are the sentence is
the incarceration.
The probation and parole all our
herds of the.
Is that are to.
reform subcommittee of.
Members of retired.
We would love to have you but
what we have learned is this
research for years and years all
don't want people who are
getting out of prison.
To rewrite that.
And the reinforced right.
That makes our communities less.
is one of the key factors in
helping to reduce recidivism
that.
Former.
Will
from re offending so that's
where the public safety part of
it.
And that's where you get the
benefit of making this.
pup in the background need to
treat maybe
I'm really sorry about that.
Ordinarily I can turn off my
speaker but not when I'm
speaking.
that and Mr speaker at the time.
When I'm not debating.
Trying to help with the
mechanics.
Of helping a county court and
the secretary of state.
And getting folks that of
you mentioned the interim
committee one thing that I've
been working on this concept of
a certificate of employability
for folks that have propelled
Percent of recidivism but beyond
that I think it's important to
help people get reintegrated
back into society become
productive members of society
Gen.
But I think this is a little
sentence as though that is the
only part of the sentence but
it's not.
So incarceration is a component
of the sentence but then there's
often times appropriations that
As part of their sentence there
answered gonna be yes because
those are limitations on their
freedom.
For example many parts of
probationer requirements don't
from appropriations
but that's a new concept I think
in our law.
And so I'm all for trying to
of more streamlined I think that
makes sense it would probably
save the taxpayer.
Some man hours in terms of cost
all.
But the language in this
And so my question BFI.
Violate the terms of my
appropriations.
I'm going back well what
actually happens is we have a
me back to a correctional
facility.
And so it seems to me Mr speaker
that that that person actually
build the term present is that
correct.
And is back in the United
States.
Thank you Mr speaker and so you
outstanding parts of my
sentences are correct.
I'm sorry.
so we if I still have remaining
parts of my sentence namely
appropriations.
Of those who might serve the
entirety of my of my time in the
I would say that that's true.
Thank you Mr speaker.
And so I.
having fulfilled the terms of my
Jan have.
And so I guess I want to know
for example.
Section three of your bill.
Mr speaker I as I understand
what section three does that
repeals.
The entirety of section thirty
I'm cert repeating now.
Yes Mister speaker.
If you look at section three of
Section thirty one dash thirteen
dash one and replaces in its to
the new subparagraph A. B. C.

I thank you for that because we

Thank you Mr speaker consultant

require.
Something additional it's not
just simply being released from
prison is that correct Mr
speaker.
If much of the emphasis of this
bill.
Is to restore.
Fundamental rights to our phone
men and women from being able to
run and hold public office.
in fact demonstrating side of
the bed out of.
I miss speaker German I don't
think I followed that.
Or maybe we just making a
statement.
Right to balance to have served
their time within car serration.
Why do we not also extend them
the right to run for public
office.
I'm Mr speaker and gentlemen
quite simply it is it was beyond
the scope of our.
could both is able to do so and.
Also I don't yet have any
I don't have any evidence to
that effect we do have evidence.
About the.
So this.
whole prog public office.
Does it restore say for example
the second amendment right to
own and possess firearms Mr
speaker.
to be the.
The administration.
For a bill like this which is we
have men and women who made a
mistake.
They have now filled those
terms.
but we're telling them they can
have the right to vote but.
We're not going to go any
further and not allow them say
speaker I I still have concerns
about this bill again I our
support to the trying to put
food recidivism.
build the terms of their
sentence is our men and women
who have been released from
prison are still trying to
complete the term from patient.
they're still on the terms of
their judgments and so.
You Mr speaker the gentle lady I
I look forward to the day that
we can meet in person thank you
for the debate.
Thank you.
You Mr speaker and I have a
quick question is this bill
retro active.
for his vote and he said he
didn't vote.
And I blurted out why not.
And he said because he was a
restored so with this make it
easier for those who have been
previously convicted and are out
on.
Have have completed their
And I'm sorry.
We are for very hard time today
we all have to learn how to do
that.
that CYFD because and I was at a
visit between her parents and
the baby
and was the parents did really
He told me at that visit that he
was a former felon and he
couldn't vote and I said but you
can't and he said what I went to
the county clerk I he said you
know I did one prime he said it
registered right away is that
most people have lost track of
their paperwork.
I'm gonna have to find it.
Whether there for if it's from
so as I as I said at the outset
the secretaries states that.
Our law should work when we
passed but it just doesn't
In New Mexico there possibly
over twenty four thousand voters
who don't vote because of felony
convictions.
Some of those might have

Thank you very much.
One more vote.
Thank you Mr speaker well the

I will yield.
debate.
And throughout the public
comment that was have we heard
this bill earlier.
And.
legislation is restoring voting
rights.
Mr speaker gentleman now I would
I characterize it as a change in
the process of restoring voting
rights.
restore voting rights if the it
provides that the voting rights
are never sever would that be an
accurate statement.
And those people didn't ever.
Before hand.
So they were not
disenfranchised.
Mr speaker and and gentle lady
that's not only correct the this
bill does not sever voting
rights upon a conviction of a
while incarcerated.
Mr speaker madam chair.
If they have been convicted of a
crime Mr speaker you that is
correct.
If they're awaiting trial and.
For the convicted felon the only
time they cannot both under this
legislation would be what they
are actually in the
For instance the convicted
felon.
Is out for whatever reason
understand the need for content.
Well let's the Mr speaker let me
present the following
hypothetical let's say that for
period of time but ultimately is
going to have to return to the
facility.
If that short period of time is
around of election.
this bill.
The only condition for not
allowing them to vote is that
right our.
gentleman from Travis I forgot
to the scenario you're
describing I think.
About.
thousand prison beds.
Do not available through the
department of corrections and
let's say as a result of that
legislation if it gets past that
allowed to return home for
periods of time.
And during those periods of time
that they are home they're not.
In the state.
Mr speaker gentleman I you're
just speculating and I I would
I'm not going to go there I'm
not going to speculate that I
think that the calls for way
more speculation than I'm
only condition and your bill.
That.
Would pre vet a convicted felon
for voting.
Is that they are physically
Mr speaker and gentleman.
This contemplates.
A release from prison.
Well let's look at the language
the settlement of Mr speaker
madam chair.
On page two.
correctional facility as part of
the sentence for a felony
conviction.
That's what the bills for the.
And so I'm asking you.
That is impose that free budget
a convicted felon from voting.
Is there are present.
Your Mr speaker entitlement
you're reading this section Eric
comes to the section two
subsection eight correctly I
subsection B..
The image of a given an
opportunity to register to vote
or update an existing
registration so this is what.
subsection D. talks about.
They're updating their voter
registration maybe they need a
new address maybe they want to
change party.
they want to become registered
to vote that has nothing to do
with their ability to vote
outside of.
A correctional facility that is
facility which is the only
condition that prevents them
from voting.
Yeah and that's that's what the
bill says.
You're working.
All I'm sorry I was distracted
Mr speaker the all the of
provision that deals with both
voter registration to get
registered things of that
nature.
So.
I think we could think of some
Mr speaker madam chair the other
thing that this the piece of
legislation does and and there
we a while that.
You have a yeah maybe an
opportunity to give adult from
Of and you can call the a
transition period what have you
but the other thing that that
often times yes
a convicted felon.
Does not have their voting
rights removed when conducted.
And when they get out they
immediately.
parole I find all of the bill
all the other terms of their
release including payment of a
Madam chair as you know this is
one of those issues.
We agree to disagree on
I I can't support this bill but
advocates that people should not
lose their voting rights as a
result the the all on from my
convicted felons should not have
voting rights are restored until
they go through the process to
I'll be voted against this
measure thank you madam thank
you Mr speaker thank you madam
chair.
For the debate the gentle from
San Juan Representative Montoya.
Mr speaker I do you.
Thank you Mr speaker one
question from our
Representative nine nine works
Were to
Re offend in some way.
And returned back to
would
Would they be able to vote from
the facility.
Mr speaker and Jody.
really didn't address that but
frankly if someone committed
another crime in fact in in
prison here she doesn't you know
the back to that square one as
in prison then that's another
story.
Mr speaker and gentle lady
the I'm looking at something
in first for some other reason
what they will be able from jail
because I mean they would
potentially back in jail for
violating probation.
From jail be able to vote
speaker generate.
There's Mr speaker in terms with
the San Juan there's really this
Is reinforced rated on a
violation of probation parole
and they're going to serve out
this sentence they're back to
not having a voting.
wondering if the if they and I'm
not a lawyer that's why I'm
asking this specific question.
If they violate their can
conditions of parole.
Then once their voting rights
have been restored.
It doesn't seem like it would
prohibit them are there other
folks in jail who have not
their parole they go back into
jail but even though they have
re offended and the purpose of
this I understood was that we
but that somehow it it's
it's handers resident recidivism
but they have gone back for some
reason.
I don't see with this prohibits
And they are able to go from
prison.
Am I missing something there Mr
speaker and a lady.
levels of that violation before
here she is returned to present.
This contemplates if you're
locked up you're not voting.
This bill has no effect on the.
On that individual so that
individuals not gaining anything
by virtue of this for an active.
this would have no effect one or
the other so I I think once
their voting rights restored
even if they re offend.
They can vote from jail if they
were to request an absentee
hole in the in the argument that
that I'm having trouble with.
but the speaker and generated
and just a different question
Oregon close to time I want to
To restore the voting rights
that we were being unforgiving
and we're bearing hateful garage
don't also believe that we
should give all the rights back
you know we were not going to as
it was stated earlier by
Representative lane we're not
give back
their second amendment rights I
mean we're wanting take second
amendment rights for people who
haven't been convicted of
Waiting not even necessarily
waiting trial for anything but
just based on someone who says
that they feel that they are a
going to forgive them and that
we want to restore their rights
as we say actually several times
separating them from their
constitutional rights this is
second amendment is one of those
M. in whether or not can they
wrote just because there may be
released out of prison early
because of the COVID we did
release a lot of people early
It does seem to be were being
very very selective here and
that that if we don't get back
voting rights were not being
forgiving.
this bill right here so I know
you might that might be your
answer.
But I'm just wanted to know
would you support these other
things would you do you feel
like they that we should be
the festival so much on
individuals and I'd rather not
weigh in on that it is it is
beyond the scope of the.
This.

that we all will Mr speaker and

above all it does use the.
way
For a long time can make dumb
mistakes we're not just
targeting them
but Mr speaker and a lady I just
out and and maybe some some.
Questions that you weren't able
to answer as clearly as we we
might like but would you be
willing it on the other side of
people from repeat offense
would you be willing for the
bill to be amended on the other
side that if someone does
if it doesn't work in that
individual.
do we would we would would you
be willing to maybe support
something on the other side that
Mr.

I have been trying to tell you
that's not necessary in this
