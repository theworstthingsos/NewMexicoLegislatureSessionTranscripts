Representative.
Representative I'm sorry vice
chair Johnson practice.
I'm sure women Georgene the
list.
We have a.
Thank you we have a quorum.
So now we will begin with Senate
bill one Representative Lewis
chairwoman Lewis.
Take it away.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you committee members good
morning
First go ahead and introduce my
experts and then talk about the
bill and then also have one
mixtures talk as well miss so
the first expertise mark Baker
healthy here to provide
technical assistance those are
questions and then printing
costs.
It is with research and polling
and mark Baker is with.
Thanks for.
Hanson and the paper for.
Thank action got got that the
former student
So
Madam chair and excuse me my
throat is.
Getting been terrible.
But the have now before us
Senate Judiciary Committee
substitute for Senate bill one.
And I will say today that this
is eighty six point eight
percent overlap with the
people's map and
really what we're doing here is
ensuring that
you know our congressional folks
now will have both rural and
urban instead of making that
rural urban split.
It also increases the Hispanic
voter age population in the
Southern District and it's
really about giving voters the
choice and if we can pull up.
We need the.
Very
much so your head using which
of.
SNL at Britney speak about this
having a hard time hearing
Georgene.
That.
Representative had a hard time
hearing.
I will choose my from here on
out sorry that estimate that
doesn't help.
That about.
District.
So.
Testing.
As a surrogate.
Testing.
Just down and down.
Testing.
Okay great.
Yes so
I try to be brief but basically.
The this map that we're seeing
right now which is the bill
before as the Senate Judiciary
Committee substitute for Senate
bill one.
Is a pretty close to ninety
percent of the people's map
which was this year sehmat
provided to us earlier what this
does however deference because
it does include increase the
Hispanic voting age population
in the Southern District.
And then I'll
turn it over to but maybe you
could talk about that.
Status.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative good morning what
is going to take us there really
quick walk around the districts
and I wonder can you hear me to
this Mexican use my fingers to
scroll around okay.
can you hear me thank.
So we'll start in a
congressional district one so
congressional district really
retains its sort of urban core
it keeps the vast majority of
Rio Rancho it keeps that most of
Albuquerque including the east
side and it comes around taking
in the east mountain communities
of which is currently and
congressional district one.
The difference is is that
commercial district one is
picking up significantly more
rural counties so under the
current districts as CD one only
has Torrance County under this
proposal I think when we pick up
quite a little bit County to
Baca County all of Lincoln
County the northern half of the
the Mescalero area which is
something that they've asked for
it to be split into two
congressional districts so this
honors that as well as the
northern part of Travis county
including part of I'm sorry the
wrong direction including part
of Roswell so the majority of
Roswell is in CD three but
there's a piece of Roswell in CT
one under this proposal also all
of Artesia is in congressional
sorry a congressional district
three in this plan
so congressional district three
goes from Artesia and of the
northern part of Hobbs in Lea
county so you can see most of
Hobbs in Lea County including
Wilmington so the northern part
of Lee County going up through
Roosevelt County curry county
where a.
I'm really still retaining its
sort of northern corn as it is
under current districts you can
see that it's it's taking most
of Santa Fe County except for
some precincts that include and
would keeping Edgewood whole
incident that and congressional
district one including the
Farmington area and then the
northern half of Zuni pueblo
which again is something that
they requested to be into a
different congressional
districts.
district to then comes from of
this sort of current northern
boundary of district to coming
through the Rio Grande Valley
through the north side side the
west side of Albuquerque
through the south valley then
down the Rio Grande corridor
through Valencia County.
keeping us across the whole
coming through the southern
counties and really again
keeping up court of the Southern
District inside of district to
and madam chair I think that's
that's sort of a brief outline
of what this a congressional
plan does and if you don't mind
I'd also like to add to show you
what this looks like with the
boundaries of concur of the fear
C. concept H. because as
Representative Lewis said there
is a an eighty six point eight
percent overlap between what's
happening in this map and what
was proposed under congressional
CSE contact H. so I put up this
sort of green right and that's
that's the proposed boundaries
under us here see contact H. and
you can see there's a
significant amount of overlap
the differences are that under
this year see contact H. Travis
county is capital
in under this proposal Sapporo
County is capital and one other
thing I'd like to mention is
just that Rio Rancho is fully is
is mostly in a congressional
district three under concept H.
and again is is split under this
proposal.
And so madam chair I think
that's all I have.
Thank you.
And.
But that madam chair we stand
for questions.
Thank you.
Chairman Lewis we will now go to
public comment.
So will ask the audience to make
their comments at this time.
And here in the United States

In opposition to this is that.
Three representations that four

swapped.
Rio is one is going to lose.
And because money.
Politics and if you.
I call it it is we know.
What are in.
Right here is it appears that
the situation has been given to
the logistics the reality of the
requirements of the regional
office as we heard with the
young lady from Ross will.
State at.
Of over three hundred.
Up to six hours for part makes
it very difficult to serve this

precipitation and consideration
to our workers are people going
and the committees to format you
want.
That thank you.
Thank you.
I believe that Representative
up the zoom comments public
comments so now we will go to
committee members and I have
Representative Ortez on the
list.
Thank you madam chair thank you
madam chair for that
presentation I have a couple
questions
can you can you highlight again
the difference with the
differences on the on this map
between CRC concept eight H. and
what's being presented here
today just so I understand a
little bit better I think it's
eighty six percent of the
concept age has been accepted so
we're the differences again
thank you.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative so all step up
here in Rio Rancho again the
green lines are the boundaries
of concept H. so you can see
that their so in concept H. a
real Rancho glancing
congressional district three
under us under this plan it goes
into congressional district one
there's also some differences in
the boundary on the west side of
Albuquerque and in the south
valley
so in congrats and contact H. I
I think that more of
incorporated Albuquerque was in
CD one and you know a larger
percentage of unincorporated
Albuquerque was in CD too so you
know these areas out sort of a
past paradise hills and these
unincorporated places in south
valley in the pot hundred on the
SAT
and alleged county you can see
the line is pretty different
and with nice about conduct H.
is that it kept some of these
sort of one of Lente county the
city's whole like awesomeness
was Travis what's nice about
this current proposal is that
this line here follows the river
which is a much easier boundary
to understand for voters it's
also the same boundary that's in
the proposed US Senate plan so
it's nice when those are able to
overlap
The differences as I mentioned
the fear C. concept H. with the
coral county right in half under
this proposal Sapporo county as
a whole in district two.
and then again Travis county is
it was fall under concept H. and
is split under this concept
between congressional districts
one and three and then in the
CRC concept H. Artesia and this
northern part of Eddy County
within congressional district to
under this proposal that piece
goes into congressional district
three.
Thank you madam chair thank you
madam chair for and I'm so sorry
if I forgot your name in the
past thank you operating
The question is how does this
committee substitute different
from the original SB one that
was introduced.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative this time I'm
going to put up some red
boundaries and the this is the
original Senate bill one and so
I'll just walking around again
really quickly so here in in
sort of Santa and and Santa Fe
counties are eight are I think
we're the biggest changes are in
in this sort of northern part of
the urban area so Rio Rancho
under the original Senate bill
was whole went all the way out
and was whole in congressional
district one under the previous
proposal
District one went all the way up
halfway into Santa Fe County
included places like El Dorado
and Glorietta and now it's it's
just includes these sort of east
mountain communities and the
rest of Santa Fe counties and
congressional district three all
of the boundaries through
Bernalillo county through
Valencia County are identical in
the original bill and a
substitute
another really big difference is
a is the sort of eastern
counties so under the substitute
the county them quite a little
bit about the and at the
northern part of Chavis are the
in a CD one under the under the
he substitute under the original
bill they were all in CD three
and so this this really was the
sort of more population dense
areas of Santa and Santa Fe
counties for these less
population dense at eastern
counties if that makes sense.
Thank you madam chair thank you
so much that concludes my
questions.
Thank you next I have the
majority whip.
Thank you madam chair.
So could you explain to me
Could you give me an approximate
numbers around the Bernalillo
area
on both maps.
And Senate and the Senate bill
one and then the the substitute.
how much population we're
looking at in that that really
area I'm Madam chair
representative I can tell you
under the substitute how how
many like the percentage of
Bernalillo county that's in
district one in district two but
I don't have that for the
original Senate bill okay and
I'm sorry it's on my phone I'm
gonna.
so so what we did was we looked
at the total population of
Bernalillo county and we looked
at the percentage of Bernalillo
county that's in CD one and CD
two and
Sorry pulling up now.
I think in fifty one and it what
it is
Sixty eight point nine percent
of the total population of
family of county and city to its
twenty six point nine percent of
the population Bernalillo
county.
Okay.
Madam chair miss pas
the reason us and and I respect
the process and I in the I just
got my head around this and and
just for the the audience
It part of the delegation and on
and I County
You know in in southern New
Mexico will say that we're the
step children because we have
media access and it's hard to
get a lot of of I constituents
to really know what's going on
during the session just to for
our our schools to you know our
our universities of to to even
have the the same type of
knowledge mint that sort of
thing and so
yes we see this map and so all
of this kind of a thing when we
first saw it the first reaction
was you know by putting as
will Albuquerque number one the
potential for us to have through
representatives from Albuquerque
and maybe taking the chance of
having representation for away
from the south is concerning.
so I just wanted to put that out
there
we also by not having a lot of
media access so somebody does
run from Fe Los crucis.
that somebody is running in
Albuquerque all media outlet is
a passive.
And so you know say somebody on
city council from Bernalillo is
running well everybody in that
area knows that city councilor
for some of the from the Las
Cruces city council noted does
that person and so just just to
throw that out there for the
public to understand where some
of that concern is also we do
have a broader issues all the
time more maybe the Albuquerque
person really doesn't understand
the type of issues that we deal
with.
And so those are just concerns
that we have as a delegation.
Would you like to just that
Representative and children
thank you thank you madam chair
and thank you
okay those so in and thank you
for expressing those concerns
because I think a lot of folks
aren't really familiar with what
the seller has to deal with when
they're coming to races and the
media market and getting a lot
of that from el Paso and you
know.
You USA the step children.
The state is that I get that and
thanks for telling everyone here
especially the public but in
terms of
the committee substitute for
city too well and you asked
about the Bernalillo county
numbers that was twenty six
point nine and the Donna Ana
County numbers is actually
thirty percent so Donna and
alone is is bigger than
Bernalillo county but not to say
you know that would ever happen
but I I just hope that you know
is this in a little bit and I
think especially and and coming
about these maps what we're
really doing was having everyone
how the employees as to pose to
like pending let another against
one another especially when it
comes to Earl and remember only
and excuse me well and
And so hopefully than having
everyone have a fair voice are
heard by so that that folks
aren't being ignored they're not
being you know
Rate against one another but I
just wanted to bring that to
your attention as well but thank
you for saying that two and and
and this committee.
Thank you madam chair and and I
appreciate that I and I I just
wanted to go on record to make
sure that that was brought up
because I think those are things
to take into consideration
moving forward I do just like I
said at the very beginning I do
respect this process and I I do
believe that if there this is
need to be heard but I also felt
that that this needs to continue
to be part of the dialogue.
Thank you thank you.
Senator neighbor.
Thank you madam chair of.
It will come as no surprise that
I'm not particularly fond of
this concept map.
And the lord's predecessor.
The idea of splitting seven New
Mexico.
Not recognizing many county
lines and and really I see this
map because of us all fall on
rural New Mexico particularly
the agricultural areas page
seven New Mexico's pretty proud
of.
The
Meetings that I attended
There were several that
expressed concerns about the
need for the supersede to
protect.
Rural New Mexico in
it's development of
congressional plans.
And when you have all three
congressional districts going
into the
Metropolitan area.
That to me is an assault on the
rural parts of the state because
the reality of.
It's going to be very difficult
for the as expressed by my
colleague from Dona Ana County.
Very difficult for people
outside of the Albuquerque metro
area to
Secure the political of.
Congrats to.
Secure office and that's that's
a concern.
specifically with respect to.
The district I represent the
counties that I represent.
I can tell you there's no desire
of Lincoln County to be part of
CD one.
There's no desire of Travis
county to be part of CD one.
Frank receiving through.
but the lotus lines drawn this
not only spreads Travis county.
Explodes a town of forty seven
thousand people.
There are parts of rules with
New Mexico that are in CD one.
Imports of Roswell that are in
CD three under this plan.
I understand why Albuquerque yes
the the the town of forty seven
thousand or higher up to town at
thirty some thousand.
You don't have to split Townsend
so the people with that town
don't know who they're.
Congressperson is.
But that's what this map as.
And it is.
As pointed out by the
representative from Bernalillo
earlier public comment.
People are going to be confused
if you look at the the maps in
the southbound Albuquerque.
Revenues a river the news I
twenty five there's.
Difference is a city districts
are going to go
One person on on one side of one
street is the the others that I
don't know if it's in the same
neighborhood those folks are
gonna be confused as to who
represents them in Washington
DC.
I think our job is to try to
create clarity work where we can
and that create confusion.
This map is a jigsaw puzzle put
together to meet political wins
that's what it is.
And I think we could do much
better for our citizens.
Much better for being clear.
And provide clarity to the
citizens of New Mexicos to who
represents them in Washington
DC.
I know when I got home and they
see how Ross will is the
legislative.
The the county commission
district the.
At the end of garden Avenue.
Thank.
House of on one side of the
street are going to be an
incentive through the house of
on the other side of the street
are going to be in any one of
those folks are going to think
that thank you but in the state
and the district
The.
It's going to be quite a quite a
interesting discussion I I will
have want to get back to rules
will trying to explain who lives
where what what conventional
district the.
because it's the little
neighborhood is of the
representative pointed out of
the south valley with the
neighborhood.
Medics.
I will sense when you have seven
hundred eleven thousand or so
people that you can work with in
in each district.
Madam chairman and madam chair.
This plan.
Is not a plan that the was
created by.
The the research and polling for
the C. R. C. was.
So Representative Nibert H.
this is a modification of the
planet by the sentencing
But then also ensuring that we
have both rural and urban in
those districts as well as
increasing the Hispanic voting
age population in the south.
This.
Thanks plan from which was
derived.
Or at least eighty six percent
of it was derived was that a
plan developed by research and
polling for the CRC.
Madam chair and representative
Nibert no.
So Representative says
redistricting commission.
We have a plan that's before us
it's not it's not the plan that
was developed were approved by
the CRC it's not a plan that was
developed or submitted to the C.
Garcia by the
Experts.
Research and polling I think
they were the contract agency
for the state Garcia.
Have and so what's happened is
you have some maps and and the
some groups have got all of it
and the Senators.
Senator senators they have now
taken things and move things
around and I will submit to
achieve a political at.
Because each one of these
districts.
In my opinion reduces the voice
of rural New Mexico state will
not have a representative in
Washington.
At the conclusion of next year's
voting
Mexicans are
I think it was aptly noted Madam
chair and the madam chair that.
Putting.
This protect myself please New
Mexico and in two to three
congressional districts
Is a concern because we do have
a an industry that not only.
provides significant benefits to
the state of New Mexico but but
really is the.
Substantial driving for for
southeast New Mexico that's all
and gas industry a lot of people
don't like the industry but it
existed it brings a lot of of
good paying jobs and and
opportunities for particularly
at AM eight county as well as
Chavis and Roosevelt
And.
As well as I look at the map.
Those interested going to be
divided and apparently
championed by three separate
Congress persons who are likely
to be from the metro area we
know nothing about that
industry.
And and so.
And I'll talk about the being
ignored I think that can be
expected
at least in my part of the state
that the those issues and
concerns in the ability to
addresses issues is going to be
largely ignore the but.
Eddy County over over.
At fifty percent of the.
S. production that occurs and
Eddy County New Mexico's from
federal lands so it's not just.
It's not just going to affect
New Mexico who represents some
of of fact all of New Mexico not
just of the county.
And it's vital that the the we
in New Mexico and to the you
figure out a way
of
Mr representative from the tax
committee
help to secure forty percent.
The budget from other sources
will we got a problem and so we
need strong advocates in
Washington who will continue to
Supportive policies that will
allow that revenue stream to
approve not only to Eddy County
but.
The entire state of New Mexico
that that is going to be
critical.
The I don't see that happening
here.
To sit here all day and that's
questions with it's going to be
a relevant so I'll just cut it
off there we may have this
discussion on for.
Representative Zamora and then
Representative Chasey.
Thank you madam chair and and
thank you presenters for the
presentation of the maps I to I
also have concerns
When you look at CD one.
Rural New Mexico.
CD one bottle of the.
The Baca Torrance and Chavis
counties.
Are mostly role but whoever runs
in CD one.
Can go on to Albuquerque get all
the votes.
Not have to even go visit the
rural people in these four
counties.
The way it.
And and and Chavis county being
split up.
Also silence a lot of folks in
in the rule in the southeast.
Get a great concerns for the for
the rural counties that are in
CD one.
That's my biggest concerns and
and I.
Look forward to getting with our
demographer and and looking at
those numbers.
And I have a question.
For Britney on the what we keep
talking about the eighty six
percent.
Eighty six point six.
And that there are some minor
changes made there
can you go into detail on that
well maybe they'll you know what
got into detail on that some but
who made those changes and and
why.
Madam chair representative I'm
sorry I'm not sure which changes
you're talking about we're from
from concept H. to the map that
we're not looking at right thank
you madam chair thank you
Representative thanks for
clarifying I we were present we
research upon we're not involved
in the drawing of either concept
age or any of the Senate bills
or the substitutes and so I
can't speak to the intent of
those maps as they were drawn so
so madam chair and and Brittney.
For these changes as this part
Senate the Senate yet Madam
chair representative yes okay so
yesterday so madam chair Britney
so the Senate would make those
changes.
Madam chair representative yes
okay thank you thank you for
that answer and the.
I believe that concludes my
questions chair thank you.
Thank you madam chair.
Chair of the questions that that
question because of I wondered
about the market I don't know
the realities of of Los crucis
so.
New Mexico and southern part of
the state so the question is
probably for those from that
area.
If in fact there were out.
Where.
Two major political influence is
more spread out.
Throughout the fifth largest
state geographically.
I'm just wondering if there
might be a greater interest by
the media.
Covering the southern part of
the state
I know this is speculation I
don't know that much about media
markets but.
It would seem to make sense for
the manager here to learn about.
The south as they currently do
now so if it's alright
Chair I'd like to see if
Representative Gallegos with.
Speculate with.
Well it
is.
Measures which led me to
sponsor.
and as you said it would not be
speculation but I would hope
that that would be the case
and maybe that would put us a
little bit more on the map and
and we would get more attention
because
Like a set of many times when
you know we're and in session
now
my constituents don't have the
data to a play as you know as I
said in in the mornings getting
ready before the four sessions I
can get a play by play of what
is going on the day before
during you know what happens
here at at the capitol and no
word as to what is happening
here down south and literally if
we want anything
even mentioned we're having to
call media outlets in
last crucis and you look at the
sun news and the bulletin and
the bulletin what runs once a
week and so you usually if there
was something which they're a
little bit better at running
it's it's old news by the time
people really get that
information so
very frustrating.
Madam chair and and and
Representative Lewis
representative Gallegos I'm
gonna see if I can find out.
From a former president of K. O.
eighteen who nine now in.
To be able to talk about that
later and see if she has any any
thoughts.
We've been to
By those who participated in the
C. R. C. process to expose.
Do shows that from of any not
that the CRC recommended.
I guess I would.
Two way of thinking as someone
who has said this committee
chair of the house Judiciary
Committee.
And
listen to the floor debate so I.
We've been offered explanations
for every change.
What it would do not feel that
way
Madam chair representative
Lewis.
Madam chair representative
Gallegos are cracked.
So.
I don't think people are saying
Sanchez essay well we made this
decision for reasons that we
don't wish to share with you.
So I I want to point that out.
I'm sure both caucuses have.
Given information about and I
know the CRC had information
about this the whole concept of
splitting in the area.
There are.
Prevost.
That have expressed a preference
for a split.
There are problems that have
expressed a preference for
The whole approach.
Is there any public comes to
mind because it's my
understanding that they wanted.
A split so that they have two
people representing the pueblo.
There are some areas
right now I correct I believe
that Ross will has.
For the representatives from the
Santo who live in Roswell.
Technically.
Of.
So.
Candy okay three the Russell
area so so three.
That's the City of forty
thousand.
So thirty seven thousand.
So.
It's just I don't think anything
was splitting I'll get on this
right now but let's just say
they did I wonder.
Some people that would probably
feel like I would just all to be
together but there's a lot of
development outside of
the little nucleus of of all
good on is and
I just want to speculate that
the.
Constituents in that area may
be.
It really well served by having.
A greater number of
Representative even if they're
from different parties what
comes to mind is.
Get together with the person of
the opposite party to provide
for that community.
I see that in capital outlay as
we work with those across the
aisle who share certain
interests and and in a district
so I don't know that just let.
Is this is a really about they.
Don't I think it's going to
depend on the quality of the
representation at that time.
You know.
Good friend here from Chavis and
Lincoln is concerned that the
agricultural community would not
be Representative what.
I was hearing.
And.
What I yield steep about this
concept is that it's as if all
parts of our state the
agricultural community the oil
and gas community food tribes
the pueblos.
Appear in each district.
So that I feel that.
They cannot be ignored.
I also think that the.
Every single congressional
representative should be
extremely familiar about with
the oil and gas industry is a
major contributor to our
economy and.
As we transition of the energy
transition act.
Making certain that.
Communities are health whole
that we
We move efficiently and smartly.
But good partners because I know
that when I have carried the
governmental legislation.
In the past.
There are.
Good operators in there about
operators.
I found that that operators
really wanting to take
to be honest.
In the state the cast in the
shadow of the bat operators so I
think there may be an advantage.
And it's a whole new idea to me
this this the way the map has
been put together it's taken me
awhile to kind of get my head
around it.
Specially in the late hours of
the evening when we were.
S. but.
That
There there's some aspects to it
that may actually appeal to
industry under madam chair for
president Lewis wants to address
any of those points that I made.
Thank you madam chair and
Representative Chasey yeah and
so you're absolutely right then
the tribe's came get out not
just an aggression maps that you
know I think again and and and
the House map I'm not as
familiar with the Senate map.
Just yet.
There is a desire to have those
splits because folks fellow than
that you know they have to.
The representatives that they
can reach out to you that they
can hold accountable when it
comes to voting and really get
their interests and concerns at
the to the table that's going to
happen with this map and terms
of rural and urban so that now.
People in the urban districts.
Must be a lesson to better
representatives I think it gives
the herbal areas really just a
huge platform to get their
issues to the national level and
have their voices heard
and then it just.
That that's what we were trying
to do here and that's why it
differs.
Fund the CIC map is because we
want it
each district to listen to those
Roxas's and really include them
with those urban districts.
Thank you madam chair.
I wonder you know we've created
here with the use of maps if
they were to be adopted and
acted
will create major Hispanic
district.
We created to several major has
been excuse me several major
native American districts.
And our the house member that
passed the house yesterday.
Folks from the.
Our indigenous communities.
Spoke favorably of our efforts
in that regard we don't have
enough with a population to have
a major native district.
I was wondering what the
position is of the tribes and
pueblos with regarding with
regard to dismiss.
And if you're not comfortable
speaking for them.
Funds that's fine.
Madam chair and representative
the tribe's not taking a
position on the committee
substitute for Senate bill one I
do know however that
they provided portions of
congressional
areas where they wanted certain
tribes to remain together seven
times on it to be split so
that's all incorporated in this
matter.
Madam chair and Representative
Lewis.
Do you believe it will increase
voter participation.
Of the various stakeholders in
these congressional districts.
Madam chair and representative
state I I do you know the tribal
leaders worked so hard over
several months and a lot of that
was the all public council of
governors ad hoc committee that
is really spending time and
energy to look at these maps.
To ensure that you know at least
in the house maps that we
maintain the six native American
major pop
of districts
and.
This was an effort that was
being done by people from the
public.
You know when we did ten years
ago I think it was primarily led
lobby is that were hired by the
publishers but not necessarily
part of the tribe's.
Has funded.
Two twenty twenty one when we're
looking at maps for the next ten
years we have people that lived
on reservations that came to the
table to provide input on those
maps and.
Finally feel that their voices
are heard I think we are looking
at this map and especially
building off that momentum.
Of having you know our native
brothers has sisters involved in
the process and failing and if
we have.
In which excuse me well which
are most reservations you know
we have some exceptions to those
that are in major cities but
most of those reservations are
urban where you do have to.
fine honor to get to a big city
and and get some of your medical
attention needs taking care of
them.
Thank having a representation
now that must listen to those
voices we'll get those voters to
impose it to ensure that a
native voices are heard.
Thank you very much madam chair
thank you
madam chair.
Thank you representatives and
the.
One more time Representative
Nibert.
You madam chair.
This for a follow up call one
comment the the madam chair
madam chairman.
and that is a.
The representatives will now
have to Representative and
listen to maybe new
constituencies and.
My question is how does that
occur when a when a
congresswoman has already.
Maybe
Comments that are extremely
antagonistic toward the oil and
gas industry what level can give
the the southeast New Mexico
assurance that that this person
will do what you just said will
happen hi.
I don't see that occurring.
Well I think madam chair and
representative Nibert.
And this map you know I I can't
speak to
Yeah and imposition of any other
person part for me but then now
the voters can hold that
representative accountable to
you know come and visit them to
come to the table to listen to
their concerns to general work
together for the betterment of
our New Mexico.
Madam chair madam chair that's
highly unlikely when you split
into thirds.
That's what this map that.
It's what's that.
Community of interest relative
to others if you want to call it
that.
But just by observation thank
you madam chair.
Thank you.
I would like to do for a back to
Representative Lewis for closing
comments if you'd like risk of
anything and.
Thank you madam chair
yeah I just think closing in the
this is really something that
Is getting a lot of support I
think you know we came here to
the capital funded districting
session to judge job and that's
what we're doing here today I
think that by passing this
committee substitute for just be
one you know like I said earlier
we're increasing that Hispanic
voting age population in the
state of making
This districts really listen to
the voices of both the urban and
the rural and I just want to
encourage my colleagues to
support this and.
Thank you madam chair.
Q. chairman Lewis that committee
what it is a pleasure.
Representative Ortez madam chair
I move the to pass the Senate
Judiciary Committee substitute
for Senate bill one second.
K. to take.
Representative Chasey.
Representative Eli yeah.
Representative Gallegos yes.
Representative Nibert.
Representative Ortez yes.
Representative Rehm.
Representative Zamora nope.
Representative.
Check out this Jeff.
Working with yes.
We have six in the affirmative
negative.
This by voted six to three you
have a do pass thank you madam
chair and thank you committee
members and I've neglected to
the folks that commented today
as well from from the public
thank you thank you.
