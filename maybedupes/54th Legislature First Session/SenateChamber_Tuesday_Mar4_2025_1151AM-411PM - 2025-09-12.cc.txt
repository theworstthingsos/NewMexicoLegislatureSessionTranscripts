Send worth, Mr. President, I do
have a floor amendments.
Senator, if you'll go ahead and
just, uh, just introduce the
multi-family housing, uh,
obviously we've done talked a
lot about housing and the
shortage of 30,000 units here in
sure that those multi-family
valuations that have been
tremendously undervalued, uh,
don't get brought current and
correct all the way up to the
top, which could result in
um, is basically allow existing
multi-family properties, which
are
considered units with more than
5 different units within them,
they're considered residential
brought up to 40% of value and
then for new property, it gives
an option, either current and
correct, or the actual cost of
construction and there was an
amendment in the Senate Tax
Basically, the older units are
not getting rehabilitated and
newer units are not being built.
Uh, this bill will allow things
to move forward and provide
the counties, they're not fully
on board, but I think this is
addresses one of the big
concerns that they have.
Thank you. We do have a floor
amendment.
The reader will read.
amendment. Thank you, Mr.
President. I move Senate floor
amendment number 1 to Senate
Bill 186 as amended. See, no
objection, if you'll explain
what the amendment attempts to
do. Thank you. So my ancestor
reduction down to 40% of value.
So what this bill does is make
it very clear that we're not
going to
uh, the valuations for those
multi-family that are current
counties once those grossly
undervalued multi-family are
brought up to that 40%
threshold. So, uh, the amendment
basically addresses the concern
that was presented to me by
Senator Cervantes on the
amendment. Thank you, Mr.
President. Mr. President, you
need to sponsor to yield, but he
may have clarified this. I just
want to do, make sure that I'm
abundantly clear. I am an
investor and developer in
nice windfall for me
financially, and I might have to
excuse myself from the vote, uh,
rather than essentially saying I
voted on something to give me a
60% decrease in the value of my
property.
so I, I wanted, um, Senator
Worth, I think from his
explaining the amendment to make
sure that kind of, uh,
unfortunately, I'm not gonna get
the 60% uh decrease in my
amendment passes and you vote
for it, uh, yes, that's exactly
what it does. It makes sure that
there's not a scenario, and that
was the issue brought to me by
address exactly the situation
that you're laying out San
Cervantes.
Cervantes Mr. President,
Senator, you know, we, uh, we
work very hard here to remain
above reproach when it comes to
disadvantage financially, which
is your floor amendment is gonna
cost me an extra 60% of my
asset uh on multi-family housing
assets, so I'm, I'm really
something that hits me at 60% of
my asset value, but I'll, I'll
think about that a little bit,
Senator. I don't know if you
know the answer to that.
Thank you, Senator Cervantes.
stay at that valuation. Um,
again, we see all kinds of bills
in this building that have the
potential to impact us every
time we pass a bill dealing with
this chamber who do own
multi-family housing and
certainly it's up to each
member, but
I think the distinction, uh,
Senator Cervantes thank you Mr.
President. I think I can vote
for the amendment. We'll see how
the amendment goes and if it
gets on, I can probably vote for
the bill, but I did like the
idea of Senator Worth giving me
a 60% tax cut, um, and I like
Senator Cia Lopez, did you wish
to debate on the bill or the
amendment?
Mr. President, I'll, I'll save
my debate for the bill.
Senator Firo
President, so I'm gonna try and
ask them now, give me guidance
if I'm off track. Um, my county
was under the hopes that the
amendment would address the
firm those are not.
Excluded from the zero
valuation, um, at this point
with this amendment.
Mr. President, happy to, and the
answer is this amendment does
not.
Change that, so you're correct.
Senator Figuero, you have the
floor.
Thank you, Mr. President. um,
have some obligation to make a
future portion of the housing
units affordable in lieu of the
assessment.
valuation, the assessors before
this amendment, I think Senator
Cervantes has pointed out, noted
that it could result in
something we weren't trying to
do, which is a 60% reduction,
partially addresses some of
their concern about the
financial hit the county is
gonna take. They expect it to be
16 to 20 million, um, Mr.
what extent they'll be held
harmless for this lack of
current.
and correct evaluation on the
remaining property.
they're gonna stay at that.
Current and correct evaluation,
they'll continue. There's a 3%
increase because multifamily is
that applies to all the
residential properties, so that
would still kick in, but this
This amendment basically is
gonna remain status quo, so I
keeps everything current and
correct, that's current and
correct. Again, the bill is
designed to deal with something
where the assessors, quite
frankly, did not go back and
reassess. We've got, we got
Obviously, the owners of these
units for the tenants, you pass
along that kind of a rent
increase. Uh, so that's really
the underlying bill, but this, I
think, was to address one of the
was just trying to put a number
on what this amendment would
fix, given that the hit to the
county is gonna be 16 to 20
million. I'm wondering what
might the assessment be of how
big it hit the county will
actually take. But if we don't
know that number at this.
point we don't know. Thank you,
Mr. President. Senator Figueroa.
Senator, that you wish to
Because basically what the
builder, this amendment makes
sure there's not a loss. What
the bill does is make sure
those, those that are at 28% are
gonna go up, they're gonna be
some assessors apparently do on
a new interpretation of, you
know, what their job is, but I
just think going from 28 to 40
is gonna be an increase, and
this is going to prevent the
decrease.
amendment number one, we have
Senator Scott, followed by
Senator Brant and Senator Munoz
on the amendment and then for a
second time I'll go to 2nd
Cervantes once each senator has
happy to.
Uh, Mr. President, Senator,
I'm not quite sure that I get.
Exactly
what's going on here?
At 40% of current and correct.
For older properties.
And 40% of
Senator Wirth, so Mr. President,
we're on the amendments and what
the amendment does is prevent
exactly the situation that
Senator Cervantes highlighted.
nothing in this bill is going to
result to a hit on those
counties. If you're local
governments have had been out
there every year.
Getting all these properties to
in the 28% range, and it's
putting a cap on how far those
are going to be brought up, but
the purpose of the amendment is
to make sure that those
Multi-family properties that are
OK, Mr. President, um,
I'm gonna have to study this
more. Thank you, Senator, for
your answers. Thank you, Senator
Scott Sanders, we still are on
the amendments and I'll yield to
where do you yield, Mr.
President, Happy to yield.
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank
you, Senator, and, and so.
This amendment.
Would keep current properties at
dollars, just it's easy.
So
Under the original bill that
would have been dropped to
and it's valued at a million
dollars.
Am I gonna pay taxes on the
million dollars or only 400,000?
Mr Eworth.
dollars, or if you're actual
costs of construction were
$800,000 to build that unit,
then there's a process where you
construction, so again, that's,
that's how it's gonna work for
newly constructed properties,
the newly constructed will have
nothing to do with the 40%.
That's a different assessment.
Senator Brandt. Thank you.
I I appreciate that, um.
The question that Senator
Figueroa asked about the uh
amenities not being added into
bill, but I will follow up with
a question on that um.
Because I think that's probably
getting into discussion on the
bill, so Mr. President, you
could put me back on the list
for the bill itself. I think I'm
done on the amendment.
I have a question. I think it
was just my question was
answered, um, you know, my, my
interest is in
Well, let me ask the question
again, Mr. President, uh, will
Thank you, Mr. President. I, I,
I had a similar question about
newly constructed units, and I
see on 4B here on the bottom of
the amendment.
amendment even apply?
the applicable local government

occupancy and the year

calculation made pursuant to
So I just wanna make sure here
that we're
On the same page here for new,
just give me one second. Let me
make sure we get this right.
telling me is that that 40% is
going to kick in for news new
construction as well. So if
this, this is gonna really
encourage the construction of
new multi-family housings. I
uh, it's an improvement, uh, of
kind of a currently built units,
but there's a
Questions about what happens
with the new stuff that we'll
Thank you, Mr. President. I, I
think the amendment fixes a lot
of problems and a lot of issues
that we heard in committee, and,
and will they sponsor you for
just one quick question.
maybe a few.
Mr. President, my experts say
that's correct.
Mr. President, Senator, in, in
the amendment, this is only for
newly constructed when this bill
signed into law, correct?
Senator. So Mr. President, the
key piece of this amendment, it
makes sure that there's no
amendment corrects that issue to
make sure that we don't have
A property that's current and
correct, getting a reduction
down to 40% under this bill. So
that's the key part of this
amendment.
reduction on the, on the, on the
mill rate that they charge on
property tax. They always adjust
that mill rate to make sure that
they can meet their budgetary
needs regardless of the
evaluation and in the perfect
Uh, and so that's one important
thing. But if you want
developers and builders to start
moving into markets, we have
hundreds of millions of dollars
scattered out for low-income
Um, I, I don't build
multi-family apartments, uh,
have no issue with it. And so
that's the, that's the whole
justice. How do we level this
Property tax, insurance, all
those are billed by the tenant.
Those are two factors that
adjust annually that we can't
adjust in leases, uh, in, in
other situations, not just that.
the bill.
And you send him centers we're
still debating Senate floor
remember number one.
Senator Cervantes for a 2nd time
on the amendment.
Figueroa raised another point
that I had seen early in the
bill, which is that, um, this
would not only reduce the
valuation by 60% on new units,
Looks like uh components of
reading my own handwriting
problems, but, uh, the, the
question for me is when you take
the value out of a multi-family
project and you're taking out
units.
So if I'm reading that
correctly, the value of things
like the parking lots, uh,
would, would be exempted from
valuation. So would the
units and, and I would argue in
my position, I would argue that
the multi-family housing units
does not include the parking,
the clubhouse, the swimming
pool, and the other common
areas, those would be not
housing units, um.
gonna limit that application as
well too that takes out the
evaluation of all the um
amenities and ancillary
improvements,
Mr. President, it is, so
basically, if you're
So again, this is not a new
exemption that you're gonna get
to apply to a property supplied
current and correct. If you are
the owner of one of these
Then when you do the new
construction, that will be,
those will be exempted on the
new construction, but no, the,
the purpose of the amendment is
to make sure that the assessors
are not losing.
understand your amendment is to
not, uh, go backwards and reduce
the value of of my existing
developments by 60%, but then I
calling amenities and ancillary,
uh, improvements. Is that right?
And, uh, Mr. President, my
experts are saying that's
correct. OK, and that's
important again for the reasons
I stated, I, I really couldn't
vote for something that's gonna
as multi-family. How much, uh,
is there some place in the law
where we define how many units
are required to constitute a
multi-family development those
will this apply to duplexes,
triplexes, uh, smaller
pertain to the amendment?
It's I, I think it's fine on the
amendment. I mean I think if you
look at the original bill, it's
now been changed to Section E,
but it was Section C. It defines
that are regularly rented or
leased or available to rent or
lease to tenants pursuant to
written lease for a term of 30
days or longer.
Cervantes. Thank you, Mr.
President. I hadn't seen that,
but I appreciate you finding
and get a 60% tax uh cut in
doing so on my property taxes, I
think this is going to explode
the multi-family housing market,
and that's evidently with the
sponsor intends to have happen,
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank
you, Senator Cervantes. Senators
we're still debating Senate for
amendment number one.
Seeing no further debate on the
amendment, Senator war to close.
Uh, thank you, Mr. President. I
Those oppose.
The eyes have it. Senate floor
amendment number one has been
added to Senate Bill 186 now
twice amended. We are back on
the bill, senators, and I'll
low-income housing and, and
build new construction. Uh, I
heard a number of 30,000 houses
short in just Albuquerque alone.
Um, that's a large number that
there. I mean, laundry mats,
swimming pools.
Playgrounds, uh, those are all
items that we don't charge in
that you have there, that you're
just trying to pay the cost of
operating the laundromat and not
making net profit. They're hard
to subsidize those when you
start building a multi-family
and figure out what your cost
playground equipment and so as
you start looking at that,
they're gonna pay an additional
cost and, and we're paying taxes
on something that really has no,
well, if you have kids, it'll
have benefits in the.
playground.
to sustain them.
And, and that's where you really
need to, if you really want to
look about how you cap or how
you increase, uh, county
revenues, it's property tax,
know, how many cows I have at
that place and how many chickens
do you have over there? They're,
they're all taxable and they
come in there and tax
everything. I call them the
vultures because they get taxed
on how many computers I have,
how many desks I have, uh, what.
And so, this really doesn't, it
doesn't affect the counties that
much because they're going to
raise that rate to what they
need to fund their counties.
Your property values are set at
a certain rate, and those are
the rates and the counties are
you're overvalued. And if you're
undervalued, you're gonna get
taxed at a higher rate too. So
that, that's the reason and if
we really want to figure out how
we want to build low-income
cost of insurance, the cost of
construction, the cost of taxes,
and, and they're not quick, get
rich schemes. You're gonna hold
these places for over 10 years,
uh, and you're gonna try to make
debating the bill. I have
Senator Celia Lopez, followed by
Senator Steinborn, Senator
Figueroa, and Senator Cher.
Senator Celia Lopez.
Thank you, Mr. President, is um
this tax break?
Mr. President, uh, not in this
bill. I think the result of this
fix up those units that are
stuck at the 28% and quite
frankly, there's gonna be a
benefit because I think this has
the potential to spur on new
construction and provide a whole
I'll ask the senator to yield
first, um,
Does this tax break extend to
out of state, um, investors.
goal is, as I mentioned, to spur
new construction and also allow
for renovation of those that are
stuck down at the bottom, 28%.
Senator Celia Lopez.
really high rents, especially in
Albuquerque and something that's
been happening in Albuquerque is
out of state investors coming in
purchasing large apartment
complexes, um.
And then, because they've
ratcheted up the rents, the
property is worth more, of
course, and then they sell it,
so they, they come in, they,
represented a couple of tenants
pro bono and I've had to deal
with these out of state out of
out of state investors.
can
Uh, can be fined after they've
stripped the carpet and um
they're living on the concrete.
Uh
And then they're shocked and
have any kind of authority, it
has been a real problem in
Albuquerque. The other thing
they like to do is get tenants
out so that they can rent
because of the, the, the housing
You can exploit us instead of
come to New Mexico and we'll do
business with you, so I am
really concerned about this
bill. In addition, the FIR talks
uh,
Senator, Senator Wirth, doesn't
that affect bond capacity?
So, Mr. President Center, uh, I
think after the amendment that
went on, which was key, so
there's not gonna be a reduction
in valuation. Uh, this is
actually gonna stimulate the
construction of more
40%. New construction comes on
board that's not happening now.
This, this is stuck, and quite
frankly, 0% of 0 is what they
Um, Mr. President, this, does
this also shift the fiscal bur
burden of taxes to single family
homeowners and other and small,
where we are, we're stuck, so no
new multifamily is really being
built, um, and, and again,
because the of tax lightning, we
have a whole number of units
the assessors are feeding folks
information that this is gonna
be a huge hit. I just don't see
it that way. I, I really think
this is going to encourage the
construction of new units, which
units. And so this is one way to
get there.
Um,
Mr. President, I haven't
received one text from from my
county assessor, so, uh, that
wasn't fed. I'm going off the
I've learned in trying to push
forward the rent control bill,
um, and so no, I have not been
fed uh anything by anyone.
Mr. President,
An efficiency means that there's
a direct that taxes are levied
at a direct way to minimize
market distortions.
And I think that this.
biggest one is to open us up. I
think sometimes, Mr. President,
we are so desperate for money
that we open ourselves up to
I am not, um,
I am not in support of this

part of the market that's not
affordable at all.
Um
So that's a concern on, Mr.
President. Honestly, honestly,
little bit different. Um,
finally, Mr. President, I'll
just say that.
I think all of our communities
are a little different in Las
Cruces, we see a lot of
multi-family being built, like
of a sweetheart deal to building
them and to developers because
we already have the um supply
and more of it seemingly built
all the time. So,
bills sometimes they have a
provision called but for.
Which means, but for that bill,
but for that provision would
something not happen?
yeah, our assessors are
concerned, um, Mr. President,
and including the Donana County
assessor.
Um, so I just don't see a need
attractive if you don't, if you
have a shortage and you're not
seeing enough of this, but I
think in a lot of parts of the
state like mine, it would just
be kind of an unneeded giveaway.
So, uh, thank you, Mr.
President. Thank you, Senator.
Thank you, Mr. President, I
would like to back up a step and
talk about the 3% residential
property value increase.
Uh, caps that we currently all
it's reliable, it's predictable,
it's manageable for homeowners.
It's the system we have so that
we can all plan for these
And that hits the buyers when a
property changes hands, it is
brought up to current and
A home buyer, Mr. President, can
pay 3 times as much in taxes as
the previous owner when that.
Correction is made to bring a
But it allows the counties to be
made whole, Mr. President, when
the property changes hands,
hold that cap at 40% for the
special percentage of
residential properties.
For luxury apartments,
multi-family apartments, um, it
Mr. Preston has been previously
stated that counties will charge
what they need to charge.
Will change that rate to what
they need to change it to in
residential property owners that
are often seniors on fixed
incomes, um, and the small.
reap this benefit.
And they will be paying the
increases necessary to fund
county services, Mr. President.
And that
Property tax exemption change
and they're gonna pay increased
rates predicted to be 15 to 20%.
increased rates.
And that's OK, Mr. President,
except sometimes we usually ask
for something back when we give
bill to tie this tax property
exemption.
To affordable housing.
Or to even future building of
more housing.
no benefit, Mr. President, to my
county. I see them getting
slammed again.
Um, for
residential property owners
multi-family unit owners it
incentivizes luxury building
without addressing our housing
shortage.
Uh, thank you, Mr. President.
Good to see you back, sir. Uh,
Mr. Pres and I would ask the
If I understand, you know, and I
heard this in finance, so I'm
gonna re-digest this, just a
little bit because in
is when these, it has to be
disclosed in a sale, is, isn't
that right, Senator Worth?
Uh, Mr. President, yes, it's
Well, and, and, uh, Mr.
President and Senator, that's
what I was wondering about. How
did you, where did we get the
3% rule went into place way back
in 2002 or 2003, and we're still
in Santa Fe.
Dealing with that issue, even 20
The problem is and what my
experts are telling me, the
majority of multi-family
property now in Albuquerque and
Santa Fe and Las Cruces, and
even in Donana County, contrary
to what Senator Steinborn said
to 100%, that's gonna be.
300% tax increase potentially
and so that creates one huge
problem. The other problem is,
the problem with this tax
lightning.
Well, that's, I think, Mr.
President, I think you
People can't step up in the
world. They're having a hard
time getting that next bigger
home because of the cost that is
This, so the, the amendment
stated that
Essentially
Anything that is.
On the rolls today.
So the 28% deal.
This keep gonna keep going on.
freezes everything cause it's
setting a 40% threshold. I think
the big issue that the assessors
presented was that this was
going to be a Senator Cervantes
said, if you, if you're at
current and correct, you're
up to 40 to 40%, uh, again,
you're just not gonna have the
current situation where someone
gets brought up to 100% from the
reappraise everything, Mr.
President.
So, Mr. President, so the 3%
think the difference would be
though, uh, with new
construction.
You're not going in next door to
the unit that's at 28% that's
will tell you.
You know, the reason I agreed to
carry this bill is because
living with tax lightning and
residential property and all the
that's the worry here is that
we've got this disparity and
grossly undervalued and the
market is stuck. So this would
be an incentive, there's no
question, uh, to encourage the
Yeah, I understand what you're
saying, but
Actually
The, the county budget.
reshuffling the cards down here
on the deck as to
Who pays what percent of that.
Because essentially, the budget
just reshuffle the deck and
maybe one guy doesn't pay as
much.
And uh I, I will admit I have
never
Got a, a discount, but
Then, you know, it's not gonna
automatically increase what the
county gets because they got a
steady budget. They'll, they'll
just increase that budget 3% a
The 28 percenters.
Up to 40s.
And we're gonna do that 3% at a
time.
So, but we're going to put a max
that we can go on his.
But I really don't think we can
overvalue those other houses, I
about here. But once we get that
40%.
That's where you multiply it
times.
1/3, right?
To actually get down to the,
bill, we're going to put a whole
bunch more cards in the deck.
Well, that's, that's the hope of
it, is to increase
multi-housing.
We're not gonna give them that
break, but we're gonna give the
multi-house, and this is
something that Senator Novell
was talking about forever is, I
to their praiser. Am I right
about that, Mr. President?
Mr. President, that's correct.
Yeah, there's an affidavit
process to do that.
Now, is that going to also have
to be divulged on a
uh, the issue that Senator
Novell worked on was commercial
property disclosure, and I think
right now I know Senator Padilla
is working on that bill and
there's one in the house too on
to 100%, uh, and so that's
another bill we'll talk about if
it gets down here.
Center woods
Well, that's another bill, so I
won't go into that.
Townsend. Senator Brandt,
Senator Tobiasson.
O'Malley.
uh, the sponsor to yield when I
have a question. So my
understanding is, um, and this
was brought up about affordable
housing, and I think what's
gonna be really important is
And there's no guarantee that
there will be affordable housing
and usually affordable housing
is defined by HUD anyway as
housing typically for families
guess, I mean, I'm looking at
the FRR and I'm seeing all this
loss in income and I just don't,
I don't think that computes. It
looks to me like we would be
this really is really focused on
creating more supply and as a
result of more supply you create
more competition. We don't have
a lot of competition in
rental housing you can, you can
find in the city of Albuquerque.
It's an areas that are, are
depressed. uh I've seen some of
this housing because there's
very little competition.
numbers dropping for um for
revenue for the county I think
these numbers are incorrect, but
that's just, I think that's,
that's what we need to be very
3% uh cap annual cap is in
place, um, but you have a sale
of a house and uh you know, I
you have a sale, they try to
bring it up to correct 100%
current correct right away. Uh,
that's kind of too bad still. I
think that's still a problem
for, for residential, but.
come on board that creates
competition. I was thinking some
time ago, um, Mr. President,
when, when there was a lot of
housing, there was a lot on the
market and you'd see signs up
Vouchers, right, where people
are looking for houses that's
what we give to folks who are
low to moderate income families
and, and they've of course these
vouchers need to get uh uh
and they're gonna, they're gonna
keep it affordable for a certain
amount of years and I think
that's fair.
That's a whole process, and
that's something that we.
and to create more competition
for housing. Thank you, Mr.
President. Thank you, Senator
O'Malley. Senator Townsend,

policy and so I just want to
make sure I understand this.
And I have a property evaluation
of 40% of that.
And my next door neighbor who
built a property 2 years ago.
Who's that 100% evaluation.
Senator Worth.
So, Mr. President, just to be
clear, the first thing you have
is gonna that 40% is gonna kick
in. That's gonna bring in the
new supply and to the extent
that there are others that are
next door to you. If there's one
they're gonna be in a different
situation. So your hypothetical
is correct for multi-family and
that's scenario.
Townsend, Mr. President and
Senator Wirth, that, that causes
That's a problem. The other
problem is if

there's many amenities that are

That doesn't seem fair.
Because again, my neighbor.
The 3rd thing that I think is
problematic is the step up in
valuation. If I have a piece of
property that I have valued at

that from me, devalues my
property.
My capital cost of that property

Senator Townsend, was there a
question there?
I think there was more than one.
And I think Peter, uh, Senator
Worth has them all trapped in
dollars, 400,000 times 1/3. So I
just want folks to hear that.
Second thing, I don't think this
is going to impact your
depreciation schedule for
some things that are gonna come
up, and I, I, I hear what you're
saying, what my experts are
saying is that the vast majority
of properties that are
multi-family are are all in this
Consequences, you know, that
result from this, and
You know, the big consequence
and the reason I support this
bill is I think it's exactly
what Senator O'Malley said.
You know, this is going to

helps prices go down, that's the
positive.

won't argue with that because I
see that, but if you're the

Thank you, Mr. President, and
um.
With the sponsor yield
happy to.
then amendments and context and
it's been changed around a
little bit, so I'm, I'm.
I'm trying to track with it.
Um
I, I found in the original bill.
Or are more around.
And I've, I've gotten, you know,
people on both sides, right? You
know, I've got uh people who are
saying, hey, don't support this
I, I think what, what Senator
Townsend was talking about where
if someone already has a a.
And they're gonna be moved up
to.
40, now, will that move up
happen in the 3% increments
just like residential. So Mr.
President, Senator, I guess the
the problem we're trying to fix
is that these previous
properties were never moved up,
the 3% like they were supposed
So, Mr. President, the problem
is those properties have been
tremendously undervalued, so
they're getting the 3%.
Uh, part of the problem is, as
you come back in and they get
the my experts are in the exact
situation, having built
multi-family a couple of years
ago, yet they're sitting here.
Uh, because they realize.
The importance of this, and I
get it. This is a tricky one,
lower value to have a 40%
threshold.
Uh, and then for new
construction, obviously bring
more product onto the market.
So Mr. Chairman, Senator.
Mr. President, they go up, they
go up 3% each year. So what my
experts are saying.
OK, Mr. President, Senator, so
how are we gonna have, how are
we gonna get the assessors to
Worth. So, Mr. President, the,
the big problem is these
properties have been
tremendously undervalued.
So there's been a 3% increase
done on a property that's been
bucks, but it's been valued at
$200,000. And so there's a 3%
threshold that's there, uh, that
will continue to be there, but
that's the real problem is that
Right? They have to come up 3% a
year. Mr. President, unless they
sell.
And that's, that's the problem
those properties invest in those
properties would have to
consider.
Is that jump. Is that, is that
right? I mean, that, that's
just, I mean, business wise,
that's what you'd have to look
at what the jump will be.
28% to 40% is manageable, but
going all the way up to the 100
is what's the problem,
I think you the the the
amendment said the higher of the
amount, right? So they would.
So Mr. President, that's the
It's very, I do not know
property tax law at all.
Uh, even with my 4 years on
business and tax, I, I didn't
Um, so, so this is basic, you
know, part, partly a problem
with the tax lighting situation,
but it's on multi-family instead
of single family, um, but the
today for half a million.
Just because of how much things
went up in value during COVID.
But the next property owner.
Whoever bought it for me for
half a million.
OK, thank you, uh.
Mr. President, thank you,
Senator, um, I guess one of my
biggest concerns is, is.
We're not treating
properties being taxed at 28% of
the value. None of them are
being treated.
The right way
Because they're all being taxed
at a different value than what

transparent here that my husband

both, um, so help me, Senator
Wirth, there are A B C and D
ratings for commercial property,
correct?
Mr. President, my experts say
your lower income, uh, res or
multi-family properties and I'd
say their rents are somewhere
around $1000 maybe less per
month. Is that correct?
Mr. President, my experts say
works and why it's being brought
forward is that with tax
lightning that means if I'm an
investor and I have, let's say a
a 20 unit property.
And all of a sudden,
those owners that's at 28%. I
have my whole pro forma of this
unit and why I bought it and how
long I've held it based in part
Mr. President, yes.
So that would mean, Mr.

Again, a huge concern and not

Senator, um, if I were an
investor, whether I lived here
in New Mexico where I lived in,
I don't know where New York,

woefully inaccurate and I know
that the amendment also
addresses that and changes it.
So our, our choice here is to
move property from 28% to 40%.
we can choose to not pass this
bill and see rent uh assessments
go from 28% to 100% in this

welcome your guests as well.
They do great work. The company
does.
But uh but I'm struggling with
the with the you know the
unintended consequences that
uh, we have a tendency, uh.
To, to judge who's going to
benefit from a particular
policy, you know, and so out of
state investors don't have any
we live in and and that's just
the way it is for now, so you
can, you can hate on the system,
but that's, that's the system we
live in and, and that's the
circumstances where we find
policy outcome of of a bill or
of a policy or of an idea, not
who benefits.
And who doesn't sometimes in my
hometown we they they my friends

and building, uh, housing and
commercial buildings. It's, it's
the children in New Mexico that
are gonna benefit, but but what
we do, Mr. uh, President, uh,
historically or tried to help
people is with tax breaks.
There are so many tax breaks in
our tax code, Mr. President,
Senator Wor that, and they
because we had no money.
So, uh, but what it did was it
may have helped them on the
margin, but it also deprived us,
it deprived state government of
Mr. President, Senator Worth, is
that this tax policy affects the
counties.
It it it it affects the counties
and so I'm not worried about the
counties.
Their overall tax revenue from
the property owners of that
county, but this policy would
offset what other property
owners pay.
and why I'm probably unable to
support it and it's just like
the bills we did last year with

that now we're in a different

have to deplete the tax
Doesn't make it for whatever
reason, we should do the exact

that nothing massive changes in

that is exactly correct.

That's too easy. I can't I just
Thank you, members. I mean, I
really appreciate the debate and
respect the different sides of
this issue. I, I think when it
comes to housing, it needs to be
to also look though at this
property tax, and I appreciate
the journey that Senator
O'Malley went on in this bill
because I kind of went on the
same journey.
The reality is I think this bill

explain the bill. Thank you, Mr.
President. I was sure I wasn't
looking that bad yet.
But um anyway, Mr. President,
factors in gross receipts tax
when calculated capitation rates
for MCOs, this means all our
MCOs receive enough funding from
the state to pay healthcare
providers a reimbursement for
not show the GRT as a standalone
item on a payment they make to
the provider, that means the
provider has no way of knowing
if they were, uh, actually being
problem by simply directing the
MCOs that they have to fully
reimburse the providers for the
applicable GRT and provide the
documentation.
That differentiates the
putting this in law, we ensure
the HCA can fully enforce
provisions and make sure the

So, how are they going to uh

Um, I need service provided.
the patient that gets put into

the doctors so they're supposed
to put the rate down as an item

the MCO sends them $100 for the
checkup and they send them $8
for the tax.
That way when they report it to
the state when they're going to

really helpful because I
couldn't picture how this was
gonna happen. And then what
remedy is there if um if the

Thank you Mr. President thank
you Senator Rand. Just a
reminder, uh, to those debating
they always maintain eye contact

again.
Uh, thank you very much, Mr.

the minority whip there, uh,
that fabricator, whether they be
in state, out of state, on the
other side of the planet, they
would have to um sub
certified payrolls, so, uh, they
would be required to tell us
what they've paid, and that will
Mr. President and Senator, the
last time it was a certified
payroll, uh, that they would
have to attach to that
particular

essentially what we're talking
about here, Mr. President and
Senator. Uh, Mr. President,
absolutely, uh, primarily around
HVAC systems and things of that

Cener Padil, Mr. President, I,
I'm assuming you did some

can't say that exact figure, but
I, I would imagine it's
somewhere in that neighborhood.
And 30% is the correct
differential.
Which means if labor is 50% of

Are we on the same page?
Uh, Mr. President, I, I can't
argue with you on that because
each one of these projects is
different. The dollars available

lines of Mr. President, my

Senator, Mr. President, like,
uh, most of the work we do in

done and the quality of the work
will be there, and I, I feel
like we really need to be doing
this.

Um, Mr. President, Senator, I'm
just trying, just a minute ago,
you gave, uh,
A statement that this would um
President, paying equitable fair
wages will, will, uh, fetch the,
the highest quality workforce
and thereby, you know, the
byproduct of that will be that

So, Mr. President, Senator, if I
send a blade operator out to do
work, um, to a
Center for the, uh, I am Mr.
President, I am 100% confident
that the senator does high
quality work. I, I know him to
closely to make sure that we get
the best quality out of them as
possible because, uh, someone is
paying for the work, but, uh,
Mr. President, Senator, um, I
increase the cost of the project
if, for instance, I'm paying a,
a blade man at $20 an hour.
for, uh, competitive wage for
Uh, thank you, Mr. President.
Uh, again, I'll say what the,
the give the same response I did

different. We've had extreme

Mr. President, I will yield

Um, thank you, Majority whip. I,
I know we've had some of this
debate in
Who are we going to pass that on
to. Like, if I'm a contractor,

more for a job. Who, who in the
end?
Um
Take absorbs that cost.

with my business, I'm a business

my, my response and my cost
Let me, let me make sure I
understand this. You're, you're
saying it's not gonna raise the

But if, if I have to pay more.

that end with unit schools

So it's very difficult to say
where that would, where that
would land. Um, however, when
you renegotiate your contract,
you're going to renegotiate it

to achieve. Again, I'm a
baked into that, into that
proposal. Um, I win some, I lose
some, uh, thankfully, we've

been losing.
No matter how we look at this.
The end user is still going to
absorb that cost. Is that not
correct?
And Mr. President and Senator.
Won't they just pass that on to
the end user. uh, Mr. President,
magic for me to stand here and
say that I know exactly who's
gonna get be here or there,
right or left on this, this type
of a of a scenario. This is an
example, I understand, but um
And so if we, if we switch gears
a little bit.
And I, you know, I feel like
this is just adding more
Under your bill, who is going to
police this? Who is going to,
um,
Who's who's gonna be the one
setting the penalties.
Senator,
This is simply adding this group
of employees, this group of
workers to that uh that pro that
um act and uh the workforce
solutions department are the
ones that you would need to
already exist. They would sim
this would simply be another
group of employees that this
would, this would affect.
Sit in there.
Mr. President and Senator, so.
Uh, thank you, Mr. President.
Uh, uh, you know, tough to say
on that one, but uh when we had
the workforce solutions
secretary who was in the
adding another job code to the
tracking of this type of
project.
Mr. President and Senator Whip,
I,
I believe he said that they
would have to hire FTE for that.
I apologize. I'm sorry.
Um
So if, if they're gonna be
entrusted in this and
Cruces that bids a job, they can
get supplies in El Paso cheaper.
Premade
Can they not just go pick that
Senator Lina, so Mr. President
and Senator we're, so now we're
gonna go after out of state
fabricators.
characterize it as is if that's
where the fabrication takes
place, that plant where that
work is being um accomplished
would need to submit a certified
payroll to the subcontractor or
contractor that's doing the work
what, what would that penalty be
to send El Paso fabricator.
Uh, Mr. President, that would be
determined by the Department of
Workforce Solutions. I don't
Mr. President and Senator, I, I
guess I'm just having a hard
time. I don't, I don't know how
workforce solutions and, and
correct me if I'm wrong, do they
Uh, Mr. President, if you're the
subcontractor doing this work or
contractor doing this work, you,
you, you, you darn well better
cross your T's and dot your I's
and make sure that you have
everything in order because
the other, it would be the
contractor or subcontractor
would have to submit those
documents, and if they don't, it
wouldn't be the fabricator, it
would be the, the, um, the
contract.
Let's stay in the state of New
Mexico, would you consider
prefabric prefabricated, sorry,
prefabricated.
Senor Padilha, Mr. President, if
the contractor or subcontractor,
as I mentioned previously, chose
to purchase that anywhere, they
would have to submit that, uh,
that information, yes.
And my personal fabricator did
not.
Fabricate something that I
needed.
So I run down to Home Depot real
fast and I purchased that.
Senator Pad, Mr. President, the
contractor, as I mentioned
previously or subcontractor
would have to submit where they
received and where that work
came from, and they, they would
be responsible for that $6
Mr. President and Senator, but
doesn't that restrict
Where?
Where I can purchase that?
So, for example, if, if I just
office, get more paperwork, file
more paperwork with the state. I
mean, it just seems like such an
extension of bureaucracy. I just
don't see this being very
efficient.
Center there.
Senator, so would you see that
as an issue, um, to say a small
business owner.
Senator Padilla, uh, Mr.
before the project before the
work even begins.
Southern there.
Thank you, Mr. President, and
thank you, Senator, for, for
standing and, and defending

state of Colorado or in the
state of Texas.
I would find other places to
find jobs.
Then to.
Thank you, Mr. President. With
the sponsor yield for a couple
of questions, please.
Yes, I will yield. Senator, you
Uh, Mr. President, um, no,
although, uh, with my business,
I am, uh, from time to time need
to subcontract work for a call
center rebuild or reconstruction
or moving in a training room
or the sub on some work and you
finished the construction
project, uh, do you have to call
the, or do you have to have the
local government come out and do
an inspection.
you've been using uh prevailing
uh wages or do they just want to
see if the work meets the
requirement.
Um, Mr. President, they wouldn't
ask me that they would ask the
Thank you, Mr. President. No, I
understand you, you just
mentioned though to another
senator about the quality of
work, uh, but didn't, didn't
cite any studies regarding
they required to ask the city
municipality or county they
required to ask if that work was
done under a prevailing wage,
uh, law.
Center.
I've never paid minimum wage. I
want the best, highest quality
workers in the market that I do
business in and for the type of
work that I do. And so I have
almost always paid anywhere from
that's, that's, that's your
choice. That's your business.
We shouldn't be telling you who
to hire and what wage to pay,
but I'll also tell you, Mr.
they asked the question to the
contractor, did you use a
prevailing wage workforce,
that's not one of the questions
they ask. So, uh, there's that
one of the things, Mr.
president shows this increases
costs substantially. Would you
agree that prevailing wage
increases cost or not
available. It's, it's very
difficult to say that. I would
say where Real Rancho was
concerned, however,
Mr. President, uh, if it's a
public project and the portion
of the work that's being done is
related to the prevailing wage
Go over them real quick with
you.
For many years going back to the
90s, but one that's interesting
just a few years ago.
The construction bids they did a
study of about 3000 schools

schools I think you mentioned
that senator about how we want
our.
Whether
prevailing wages or other type
of skilled workforce.
It's interesting because a 2010
substantially, Mr. President,
increased construction costs for
the taxpayers.
Why would that be? Well, if
you're paying your workers more,
hundreds of contractors, Mr.

Are those studies wrong, Mr.
President or Senator?
Thank you, Mr. President. I
certainly appreciate the
public entity gets. They get a
well, um, compensated workforce,
so they get the higher quality
worker to take on those jobs and
the uh public entity receives a
quality workers to put that high
quality project together.

the question.

Of the, of the requirements by
the municipality.
What does it matter?
What matters is saving the
This is a job killer, Mr.

for, uh, answering my questions.
Thank you.
Seeing no further debate.
Senator Padilla to close on the
bill.
what we're going to have here is
prevailing wage affecting a very
hardworking, uh, subset of our
workforce here in New Mexico
that's gonna ensure that those
workers are paid fairly, uh,
That uh we we have high quality
public buildings and public
projects and I think that's
exactly what we all want and I
would say that with all that,
Mr. President.

creates a fund without an
appropriation for the strategic
water reserve and it's a program
that was established by
strategic water supply, which is
a governor's initiative, uh,
winding around right now. This
is the strategic water reserve.
The strategic water reserve is
to lease, purchase, or donation
to benefit interstate compacts
or to support threatened or
endangered species, including to
prevent the listing of new
species.

fiscally responsible thing to
do.

fund.
I'd be, I have more to say, but
I can stop.
Thank you Senator Steanic.
Senators were debating Senate
Bill 37 as amended. Anyone
wishing to debate?
Mr. Chair, I don't, I don't need
the sponsor to, to yield.
This, this particular bill, the
only trouble I had with it was
his.
senator would yield.
Mr. President, I do yield.
Uh, Mr. President.
Uh, Mr. President, uh, it's to
purchase water rights to uh
assist building rebuilding the
aquifer and which could go into
in stream flow. It's also for,
and I'm not gonna ask any, any
further questions to the sponsor
of I promised her that we, we
talked earlier and uh the, the
only trouble I have with the
bill is
Because someone
put to beneficial use on a piece
of land, water.
And, and leaving it in the
stream.
Then it makes me wonder.
Uh, the, the, so much of it
would be consumptive use and so
much of it would be, uh,
infiltrated into that ground.
So
that it couldn't be transferred
to another water.
Uh
Area, another, another district
or another water basin.
essentially that water right.
was from point A to point B.
But when you say you're gonna
leave it in the river.
Requiring that same drop to be
delivered to El Paso.
It's, it's a pretty
There's, there's a little bit of
We have vast amount of water.
That we hadn't adjudicated the
water rights.
So that was the other concern I
had with this.
Because, uh, you know,
When I first came to the Senate,
A lot of irrigation down in
Lower Rio Grande.
And I ask him, why we just
didn't adjudicate all the water
rights.
Maybe we don't want to know who
has the senior right.
So,
every time we start talking
about, well, we're going to
To
We actually have a system.
It's called prior appropriation.
And it's, uh, the senior right
To be safe, you'd always go to
that senior water right holder.
But if we don't adjudicate, if
we don't run that through the
courts to determine.
going to share water.
And if the state engineer
decides to, to share water, he
goes in there and tries to cut a
deal with all the water right
users.
Instead of using what the
Constitution says as prior
appropriation.
So,
I, I realized what the good
senators trying to do with this.
away we're gonna get from it
until we get into a huge
Legal battle, so to speak.
But it, I have some concerns
But I appreciate the senator
bringing it forward. Uh, she,
she works hard at her work and I
know that.
Her heart's in the right place,
the bill today, Mr. President.
Oh thank you, Mr. President.
We'll sponsor yield.
In the finals yield.
Mr. President, I will yield.
A bill that authorizes the
purchase of water rights.
To leave that water.
In stream.
Is that
to rebuild the aquifer which
could then flow into the
President and
Senator, could I refer you to
page 5.
Appropriate for
replenishing these aquifers.
Is that correct?
Or
Uh, actually, uh, it's, uh, Mr.
President and Senator, it is on
line 6.
OK, so these water rights would
be purchased by the state, put
into the stream and then
replenishing aquifers, the, uh,
And Stephan, Mr. President, that
is correct, and in relation to
another comment that was made
earlier, the director of the
Thank, thank you for that.
Uh, Mr. President, Madam Chair.
So is putting water into the
aquifer.
Uh, Mr. President, Senator, I'm
not sure I can answer that, but
I certainly can request
the Interstate Stream Commission
and she's waiting in the wings.
Thank you. So
See no objection, we're gonna
ask Sergeant Hos please escort
our expert witness into the
We have our expert witness in.
Mr. President, could the senator
please repeat the question?
to be the most efficient way to
recharge an aquifer.
Centerssen Mr. President,
What other ways are we not
considering with this
legislation.
Uh for aquifer recharge.
Uh, Mr. President, uh, I was
told, Senator, that you can
impound water off site to bring
in.
Sin Scott.
Senator Stephanics, Mr.
President, uh, thank you,
Senator. She's going to write me
some appropriate words to
respond.
all the time she needs, Mr.
President, Senator Scott.
So, Mr. President and Senator,
the recharge can occur in a
river channel or through

that be correct?
Mr.
methods that is natural stream.
A flow or impoundments of the
evaporation losses associated
with this surface water, Mr.
President, Senator, yes.
approximately 7 ft of water per
year. So, um, Mr. President,
Senator, my expert indicates
that it would depend on the
inquiry would be, uh, for an
average in the
Southern New Mexico.
It's about 7 ft, the approximate
evaporation rate for that water.
Given
That we are utilizing surface
water to percolate into
underground aquifers as one of
be significant losses associated
with this methodology where
mechanical injection would in
fact,
that might seem reasonable, but
that's not what this bill is
about.
Mr. President and Senator, I get
that. This is about stream flow,
inefficient aquifer recharge.
Would you describe for the body
those other objectives.
Thank you, Senator Scott Senator
So Mr. President, Senator, the
objective of this bill is to
create the water reserve fund
that could be hold up to 15
A, uh, so purchases that might
take longer than a year, uh, we
would still have funds in which
to make it. They still would
need to meet the main purposes
Mr. President and Senator, these
water rights that were purchased
to to percolate down the river.
How long would they last? is
all percolate underground in
some distance.
Uh, Mr. President, I, I submit,
Senator, the term.
Many more efficient ways to
ducks might not nearly
appreciate as much those other
methods. Thank you, Mr.
President, and thank you,
Senator, for your answers. Thank
Mr.
President, I do yield.
Thank you, ma'am. On line 8.
On page 5.
Can you describe what those may
be. Uh thank you, um, Mr. Chair
and senator, the

you believe that the

So Mr. President and Senator,
this, uh, the supplementary, uh,
cultural traditions or for
recreational uses are only
supplementary to the two main uh
purposes, which is to purchase
the water rights for
adjudication and to protect the
Um, land will be purchased, uh,
as well in order to acquire
water rights, are we going to
purchase land at the same time?
So, um,
That has been a an issue in, in
my district, uh, for some time
farmland.
Stripping the water from it and
then that.
Land is laid barren, uh, taxable
values are less.
So, um, Mr. President, Senator,
my expert indicates that there
are programs within their
department for weed and dust
suppression.
water rights stripped from it
will be required to have that
monitoring and maintenance
required on those by the state
going forward.
my, my point is, will that
continue? And I see a nod from
your right hand.
My right hand expert, Mr.
President, says yes.
Senator Townsend, we do have
further debate. Senators out.
Mr. President, thank you very
much. Well, the good senator
yield,
please.
Mr. President, I do yield.
And uh.
There's some things that I do
have, well, first off, let me
ask a question on the very
first.
Finan. Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you, Senator, uh, whenever
you create a fund, you are
making an appropriation to put
money into.
It's there, so I'm, I'm real
confused over there. Mr.
President, and the good senator.

senior rights. Tell me the type
of rights that they are buying.
um, it depends on the water

need and the use.
impression that they were only
going to buy, be buying

memory serves him right, the
correct, Mr. President, and
Senator Seonics.
Center spans Mr. President, my
expert says there are other
areas in the state that are also

we have been working on getting

throughout the state and Mr.
President and Senator Stefaniks
and your expert witness, it
ain't happened yet.

Mr. President and Senator
Stefaniks in light of what
Senator Townsend just said
regarding the land purchased by
compliance with the state of
Texas.
They were purchasing the land
along with the water rights.
The instate stream commission

to manage water, Mr. President
and Senator Stefaniks, we did
get that changed. People were
part of the package deal. People
finally did learn at Interstate
Stream Commission. You're right,
we cannot manage the land.
Mr. President, I just took my
I with my glasses, uh, Mr.
President.
What, what this bill is really
all about, Mr. President, I
would like to ask a good senator
if this water if what this bill
is proposing to do is going to
be for

the state.
So this is pertinent to all over

If those water rights are

very many of them are regarding

Uh, Mr. President, Senator, I'm
not clear about your question.
Uh, it does exclude the I and
irrigation ditches, but I'm not
clear what you're asking.
To promote stream flow that
seems like that might be a
pretty integral part of what
we're trying to do with this
bill.
So I was just kind of curious
And Senator.
I do not see that water in the
stream bed is going to refresh
the aquifer. I really don't, and
needs to do. I do.
But I think that this bill has a
lot of ambiguity in it, Mr.
President, I think that it might
need a little bit more work and
I think that it might be.

And work out the problems with
the language that's not quite so
