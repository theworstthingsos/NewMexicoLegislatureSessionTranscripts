So
>> first
week,
>> good morning, everyone. We're
going to make an adjustment in our
schedule this
morning
because Representative
Jones has to leave by
10
and we wanted to have some
time for
as broad a committee discussion
as we can possibly
have
on,
you know, what we've been hearing
and what it means
in terms of possible
legislative
initiatives.
So I wanted to
juggle our schedule around a
little bit
and have us start with
a about a
45 minute
or an hour-long
discussion brainstorming
session. If you will,
then we'll go to Larry Martinez's
presentation
and the group from Sandoval
Regional
Sandoval
Regional.
Pardon me? And the group
from Sandoval Regional Hospital
will be
heard,
Adam
at 1115.
Yeah,
want some
water.
The group from Sandoval Regional
will be here at
1115.
So let
me start by
saying
that it's
been a
very
information filled weeks
so far.
And if you go through your notes
on, on, on the last few
days,
it seems to thank
you
some things really jump
out at us as, as
things that we might
want to make a
part of
our legislative
package for this upcoming
session
as you know, we'll
make a decision in November
about what we endorse.
But if we're going to do that, you
need to begin working on
legislative proposals
long before
then.
So my thought is that we
would begin
identifying topics that
people are concerned about
and use our meetings as an
opportunity
to
um talk with the
public about them to
talk with committee
members
and to start building some momentum
around some of these
issues.
So I wanted to, to
throw it open, I have some ideas
of my own, but I'd like to throw it
open
to the committee first of
all, and then
kind of build on that. So if anybody
has something
that
strikes them as, as,
as, as an issue that
they would really like to follow up
on, um
this would be a time to bring
it up
and I'd rather start with the committee than
myself. So let's start with
you, Representative Fernon, what,
what
issues
things that you would like
to uh see addressed
in an upcoming legislative
session? >> So
thank you Mr
Chair. And um
what I, what I would like to
see, we had a lot
of conversation
about behavioral
health and all the various
committees and individuals
who are looking at behavioral
health. And so what we don't
see is a coordination
among those
conversations. So what I
would like to see is how we
are going to coordinate
and come up with a good behavioral
health plan. I mean,
the program
that incorporates our cities
and our states and
our counties with the state
taking the lead. So that's what I
heard. I'd like to see a
piece of legislation like that.
And I hope that before
our committee uh
adjourns for the
summer, uh for the
interim session that we can bring
this conversation
back one more time
having uh spoken
to all of the people who did
talk at the committee meeting
over the past couple of days.
So that's number one,
you know, one of the things that came
up is that
we didn't talk about it as much
as we should. But there is a
new protocol
out that's
being sponsored
by Eli Lilly.
As far as I know, there could be
others that will look
at Alzheimer's
disease and dementia.
But it is a protocol
a a medication
that can be utilized
early in someone's life to
predict how many amyloids
are in the body at least
15 to 20 years before
the onset of the disease.
It's not produced in this
state. So we should talk
about how we gonna get that
done because more
than 36% of our
population over the age
of 65 is
suffering from some form
of dementia or
Alzheimer's disease. And it would
be good if we can help them,
understand how we can
adjust our lives
and what we're eating that might
slow the the disease
down if they know they have the
propensity for it. So
I would just say that to you
as the, as the
second item and I always
talk in threes Mr Chair.
So, you know, I must have a third
one. >> Let
me just be, be. So
what could the legislature
do about Alzheimer's?
>> So what we can do is
actually help uh the
University of New Mexico, which
is the only entity that
I know in the state
that has the ability to produce
that drug because it has a
radioactive component
and only U and M as the,
the equipment. So that
what we want to do is to give them some
additional funding. This will help
with the health care of our,
our aging and elderly
population for them to be
able to work on
producing that
uh that protocol in
this state. That's how the
legislature could help.
>> So is there a UN
M department
or professor or researcher
that's working on this?
>> So they just got a
grant, they, meaning
UN M just
got a grant to
do some additional work
and the legislature can help take
it a next step. I
don't know the name of the person,
but U and M Health Sciences
does have this process
that they're moving forward and I
will get that for you, Mr
Mr Chair,
so that it, it so
that it clearly becomes a legislative
initiative. >> Good.
And your third >> thing.
So my third thing,
Mr Chair
is uh one of the things
that we need
to make sure that we're
doing is
how do we continue
to make sure
that we're looking at the health
of our, of our
youth. And one
of one of the items
that, that we had started
some, a couple of years ago,
we didn't do it last year, but we need
to continue it again. This year
is looking at the mental
health and wellness of
students. There are
still a number of them who are
suffering after COVID,
who are still use
utilizing
um
uh aspects
of maybe uh
violence to
resolve issues. But
if we had these mental health
rooms in each one of our
state, in each one of our
schools in
high school and middle school, so
that students had someone
to talk to when they are feeling
mentally challenged. So they
would look for things that will help
better them and not things that
would hurt them or somebody else.
And so why would the legislature
come in contact with this?
They would authorize the
funding for
these mental health rooms
as well as being able
to support uh the
students who are studying
sociology, psychology,
uh physiology. You know, we
talked about that with the people
who came to make the presentation of
the last couple of days. How
do they get these internships?
These mental health rooms
would be one place that they can
get these, the internships
that they need while we are also
helping them to advance
their uh their
profession?
>> Ok. Would that build on
the schools, uh, school
based health centers?
>> Uh, it could build on the
school based health centers,
but I would expect those rooms to be
a separate room within
the schools
themselves
and staffed by
>> and staffed by students
at the, at any one of the
US universities around the
State of New Mexico that
are studying psychology,
sociology or mental
health. So that this becomes
one of the internships that they
have before they
graduate.
That's it, Mr Chair. Those are my
three. >> OK. Good
representative
Jones.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
Um I,
it wasn't on our
agenda, you know,
this week, but
um I just wanted to
share with you all some information
about CYFD that I
received. I occasionally
I have nurses reach out
to me about
issues
that they're dealing
with.
And I got a, I got
a text, I'm gonna go ahead and just
read you these texts that I
got recently
about. These
are, this is a
concern from the neonatal
intensive care uh dealing
with babies who've
been drug exposed,
born, addicted to drugs.
Uh And this is a
particular
baby that um
was sent home just last
week from the neonatal
intensive care.
This text says, um
we sent a baby home
to a homeless shelter
after 94 days in
the NICU.
He was so expo or he
was exposed to so many drugs
at birth that at one point
he was on three medications
trying to help him with his
withdrawal.
His parents have been kicked
out of multiple shelters
due to their behavior
during his stay.
He was born in New
Mexico because his parents
were running from California
to Oklahoma.
They knew that California would
never let them keep their
baby.
So, um,
that was, that was her initial
text.
Um, the baby was
the baby was,
was released to parents
against, I I don't
think any of the nurses or
nor the physician wanted
to release the the baby
to back to the parents,
but the parents were able
to pass a drug te or
the mother was able to pass a drug
test. And
the only other
criteria
from CYFD was that the
parents had bought
formula.
So the mom was able to pass
a drug test, the parents bought
formula. They, they were
in and out of shelters, kicked out
of shelters. But
Cyfd wrote a
letter
not just allowing but
encouraging that that
baby to be released to
those parents. And
so that happened last week
and, and I know I
know from working in NICU
just how
disheartening that is to
have a baby for over three
months. They had this baby. I'm
sure that I didn't get
details about how
premature the baby was,
but I'm just
guessing the baby was probably
premature as well as born
addicted to all these drugs,
um, to have
that baby care for that
baby
otherwise would have been healthy
baby if not addicted to
drugs and then
released that baby
to a, a really
unsafe terrible
situation.
And, and so I just
wanted to
let you all know that,
um, you know, this, this
is, it's not gonna go away.
We heard lots of, we
heard so many positive
things from CYFD and I'm
not, I'm not even saying that they
haven't made some improvements
but, but we're so
broken and our kids are
suffering and,
you know, from session to
session and the year
in between
is devastating
and kids are growing up
being abused and
neglected or
not growing up, they're dying.
And I just, I
feel like we ultimately,
we are responsible for that.
I don't know who else would be.
It's us. So
just highlighting that,
um
the,
I know a lot of times we
disagree, you know, the two
sides parties disagree
on what needs to be done
where, but one thing
we all agreed on was
independent oversight of
Cyfd
and uh II,
I don't know how to
move that forward any faster,
but we need to be looking at the
next session and how we can
actually make a difference
and really focus on that
so that this kind of thing doesn't
happen. Somebody needs to
say no, that
baby can't go home with those
parents. You know, they're
probably long gone
out of the state. Now and
that
not our problem. Right.
Yeah, it is our problem. You know
that baby was in our care and
should have been cared for. So
that's all I have to say. Thank you,
Mr Chair.
>> The, the carer
initiative
has protocols for how to deal
with that. Were you saying
these were not followed?
Because II I
don't,
I don't know if, if,
if that the
picture, the scenario you
painted doesn't sound
at all like what Cyfd
explained to us was going to be
done where the
there would be a care
coordinator assigned a
Navigator. They were hiring
navigators to work with the
families. And so
there, there would have been some kind of
follow, but it sounds like
the none
of that has happened. In this case.
>> The text includes,
there was a give and take on
this is this in Albuquerque.
>> Yes, >> this is in U
and M
NICU that
there is no safety
plan
and uh
that
the care plan.
And I know I've said this before
and it makes sense to me because
I dealt with patients and
plans for care
and maybe it maybe
I need to go into more
detail. The,
the care plan is not a
plan, it's not even a
plan. It's just a piece
of paper with
a list of
resources.
And the only thing
that's required
for that
family, for that
mom to be what we call
engaged
in the plan is
to have a signature on
it. The
majority of people that are,
that are dismissed
or the majority of babies that are
dismissed with family
from our NICU from
wherever it would be
with a career plan. Don't
even know they have a
plan. It's not a
plan. It's a list
of resources
and I guess there's a check
box, you can check which
resources might
benefit that family
based on whatever their
problems
have been. There's
no
requirement that they follow
up with that. There's no
person checking on them
later to find out if they
have made a connection with
that resource
there, it is not a
plan
>> but, but in Albuquerque
at our meeting in Albuquerque, when we
specifically asked about
this,
the
department, people that
were there, I think the secretary
and then the head of the
family ser behavioral
Health or Family Services,
whatever I said,
we're hiring
navigators who will
be at the
hospitals
and who will work
with, not just give them a list
of places where they could go
but get them to those
services that they need,
get them
housing, get
them
childcare, get them
home, visiting,
get them
counseling,
Suboxone if they need it,
whatever they need would
actually take care of it. It sounds like that
hasn't either that hasn't happened
yet or
it's not being done at
all.
>> I don't know. I, I
really feel like
I would like
to,
in my spare time. I would like
to get in there and find out what's
actually happening, you
know, because there's so many
places to fall through the cracks,
you know, and
>> it's certainly something we need to,
we need to follow up
on.
Did you have something to say on
that? But you have to come
use a mic? We can't,
we can't hear you and, or
we can hear you, but the
radio audience won't hear
you.
>> Mr Chairman Juliana
Kub and I
represent a
group called CBC
S. And they
specifically work
to find career
families
and they
receive a ping when
they go into the hospital
or they actually go to their
door and we've
offered for that
for them to come in front
of this group and provide
a presentation. Their
specific task
has been from a couple
of the M CS
to find the career
families that
were never
referred and never
received career
services. And
they were tasked with finding
150
families over the
course of the year. And
in just three months of
doing this work, four
months of doing this work, they've
already found 70%
of those families.
What is CBCs?
They're an organization that
works all over the country
to find people who need
to be connected to services
who are difficult to find.
So they specialize
in finding families
like the cara families,
people who are unhoused,
people with behavioral health
services and they've had
great success over
the across the
country. So I'll
lift that back up to see if there's
any space in your agenda.
I also Mister Chairman,
I'm just wondering if that
family was never
identified as a car family
because they were
California
residents.
>> They had three
months to do
that. I can't even
imagine that that wouldn't
happen.
>> But the point is where they
was the baby born
in California
that was born, >> he was born here.
The parents were on the run
from California
because they knew that they
couldn't keep that baby.
They knew that the, the
mom was drug addicted.
They knew the baby would be drug
addicted. And
so they were leaving to a
place where they thought
they wouldn't have
anybody
taking their baby. I
guess they were on their
way from California to
Oklahoma
and, and she had
the baby
here in New Mexico
and ended up in the NC, I guess. And
>> Mr Chairman, Representative
Jones, I just wonder because
those Cararra babies are
identified through the MC
OS through the Medicaid
MC. And I
wonder if there was a
gap there, if that
mom was connected
with a New Mexico, Medicaid
MC O. So it's a great
case study to figure
out where a gap is in our
K A system.
>> It's definitely an issue that we
need to pursue. It
would be good to hear from. What
does CBC S stand
for? >> Um,
I will get you all
of their information.
>> CBC >> S. It was started
by an emergency room
doctor named Enrique
Guidano
out of Seattle.
He was an emergency room
doctor, Mr chairman
who kept seeing
people using the
as their primary
health care. And
really, you know, in a lot of those
cases, the person
coming in needed a coat or
needed shoes. And
so he decided to
really start this
organization
to reach out
to the
families who were in
need of services
that they were using the
for, >> it would be good for
us to hear from them
and also to find out
from them, their perception of how our
system may
have gaps in it or, or places
where things aren't working. Well,
be great.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you Julian. I appreciate
that. That,
that's a hopeful
note there and I would
like to hear what they have to say,
but I guess let's bring
it back to what I think
is one
of the problems and that is,
we're, we're talking about ka
as if it is
as if it is a valid
way to take care of this problem.
It is not,
I think it was 2018
when the federal government said
every state has to come up
with a plan
to deal with these babies
that have, that are born,
drug exposed, drug
addicted.
So, New Mexico did
that, but it is
completely inadequate.
It is not even a plan.
And so I, I mean,
I, I don't even know
where to start with that except
to start over
and say we have to
have what is a real
plan and a real plan
involves, you know,
realizing what your
problem is,
um, coming up
with a way to
deal with that problem.
Um, so
you have a goal in mind
and then you come back and you
evaluate whether that goal was
met. None of that
happens with this. Piece of paper
that we call a care a plan.
It's not a plan. It's
just a list of hate.
Here's some stuff you can,
you can, if you need any help
here, you can find
the help at these places.
It's not a plan. You, >> you
weren't you in the, you were at
the Albuquerque meeting. I
was heard the
department's presentation
on. >> Yes.
>> And they plan to hire 19
people to work as Cara
Navigators specifically
in the hospitals. >> The
Navigators
is a good thing.
But I guess the
main piece that we're missing
is when we're missing
all the connections
between
services
and between the patient
leaving the hospital. First
of all, knowing that they have a
plan which would
involve, that's why I was thinking the
Navigator needs to be in there saying
this is your plan
and I'm going to,
I'm going to call these
people and make sure you have an appointment
and I'm gonna make sure that you get
there.
And then
I, and you know, I'm gonna be in touch with
you, not that I'm your,
I'm not being
parental or,
um, punitive in any
way and this is to help
you. And,
um, so the
connections involved
in, in services
and then, and
then deciding whether
or not the services have helped,
you know, how do we determine
that? >> Well, I guess I'm
saying that
meeting was in June,
that was one month ago.
I mean, that they
would have hired 19 and had them working
already is kind of
unrealistic. It's
going to take time. But
do you think that's a good plan?
Because what they outlined is exactly
what you're talking about
that the Navigators
would
not just give the family a, a
piece of paper but
would get them to the
resources that they
need. >> There
needs to be follow up. I mean,
that, that's part of it, but there has
to be follow up and,
and I don't, I don't think that was
part of
what they were looking
at. I did hear
from and I wish I could remember his name
right now.
Um,
they provide nursing
care. I think
those babies need to go home with
nursing care. They need to have
a nurse
involved
when they're home to
determine whether or not,
um, that baby
is having any signss and
symptoms, uh, physical
signs and symptoms,
signs and symptoms that need to be
addressed. >> II,
I couldn't agree more.
That's the, that's the home
visitation piece with, what do
they call that?
The model that, that uses
a nurse to go home to do the
home visits. What is
it,
nurse, family,
something
partnership. The
Yes, that's, that's the model
that would be appropriate
for those families.
Yes. >> And the director of that
program said that he
has nurses waiting to
go into homes
and
he's got the nursing staff
to do that. >> Well, then
we're so, I'm not
sure.
>> Yeah, we just need
to, we need to put that all
together. Um
But, but the
there has to be a plan
which involves follow up,
follow through.
And so we don't lose
these Children once they leave
the NICU
or the hospital.
And so that's where the carer has to
be, it, it has to be
redeveloped or
changed in a way that
actually holds,
um, is actually beneficial
to the patient.
>> No, absolutely. And,
and, and we probably need
to have at one of our
later meetings, give them time
to get going and then have a
follow up and find
out how they're doing and what's
happening. Representative
Chavez, >> thank
you,
Mr Chair. I have
to agree with Representative Jones.
I think that there are holes in the
system. I know
that Cyfd is trying, they were
going to hire additional
folks. I agree that, that
they probably haven't done that
yet. Um I
have also heard from at least
one worker at UN mh
that the career plans aren't
necessarily being
followed through and that career
babies aren't necessarily being
identified. So I think we
need to dig a little bit deeper
into this.
Um And maybe one
of the things that we
think about is,
you know, how do we
provide
resources to all of
the wrap around resources that these
care babies
need? Because I think that,
you know, taking a
care of baby home
is not easy and you
need a ton of support.
Um And so,
you know, we were at
the um care
campus and they
had sort of a
model program that we might want
to think about.
Um, you know, that includes
housing, right?
So, you know, should we
be sending uh
um an addicted
baby home
with parents who may
still be using,
shouldn't we be thinking about
and they're homeless, shouldn't we be
thinking about providing them
a stable environment where they
can care for that baby with the kind of
support that they need?
Um, so that's one
of the things that I would put on my list
of things to do.
>> Ok.
Representative Jones.
>> Ok.
Yes. Thank you Mr
Chair.
So, yeah, talking
about the, the career plan, how
we can improve that, how we can make
sure that patients are getting what they
need. Um
That's important, but in this
case, right here,
the people who the the
nurses, the physicians
caring for this baby did not
want to send that baby home, but
Cyfd wrote a letter
saying yes, you can do that.
You can send that baby with
those parents.
That's, that's almost two
different things. You know, there,
there's,
that's just, I feel like so
negligent,
um,
moving on are, are
going backwards to, to what we
were saying about Navigators
last year. I think
it must have been September,
October.
Maybe it was later than that might have been
November. I went to a legislative
finance committee
meeting where we
heard from the Secretary of
Cyfd. And
I asked her, have you hired
Navigators? She said,
yes, I've hired
Navigators. They're ready to go
in January.
That's what we heard. That's what I
heard. I, I asked for that
myself
and they were supposed
to start on the ground
in January. And what did we was
it last month in June?
They were still hiring navigate,
you know, I, I want, I want
the, the, the truth.
I want the right story,
you know.
So thank you, Mr
Chair,
>> other topics, other issues
that, that came up this week that
you want to make sure we
follow through on Representative
Chavez.
>> I would like to
see us,
um,
look at
the, and
this was in the report
from I guess the New Mexico Medical
Board,
the pathways to licenser,
the two additional pathways that they
talked about. And
then also the
compact,
>> I have to say, let's
put those down on
Jerry Harrison was
listening, you know, he made
the presentation on Monday. Then he was
listening yesterday
and he sent me
a,
where did he, if I could
find it? I don't
know.
Mm.
Yeah.
No, I can't find it. Maybe it was
on my
email.
He said
it's not as easy as they
made it sound
that, that the J One
Visa is, is
the way people,
they have to be in the country
already
and to get into the
country, it's
very difficult,
>> Mister Chair. I'm talking about people that are
already in the
country.
My sense was that these are folks that are
already in the country. >> I thought they were
talking about people from
India.
>> No, I don't
know. I
remember what they
talked about was that India has
sort of created
lots of schools, lots of
schools to send people here.
That's a little bit different
from what I'm talking about in
terms of people who are already
here.
>> Ok. I mean, that's
certainly something to pursue.
I
agree.
We, we may want to find
out from Jerry if there's some
things, what
>> else? There
was one other thing that I can't remember
right now. If I could come
back,
>> we can come back. And
this is not our only discussion of this,
but I just thought while it was fresh, people
might want to bring up stuff that
has hit them this week.
Some of the other stuff that
Jerry Harrison brought up was
about needing
money,
the to
recruit social
workers
that they, they really don't have
that. They, they, they
have, they're funded to do
doctors and nurses but
not social workers or
other behavioral health
and dentists. He has money for
dentists to rep
Senator
Gonzalez.
>> Thank you, Mr
Chairman.
I really don't
have a specific
to bring up. But what I
did want to mention is
that in
listening and also
it also bothers me
when I hear
that we don't,
that the
proper
hearing was not allowed in Senate
Finance.
And this is one thing
that definitely, maybe I can work
on and I
can speak for the chairman.
But, you know, and my
suggestion would be, is maybe
to dedicate like
one week
to this part
to this issues and
make sure that you get a
proper hearing.
And one of the times
that would be excellent
would be because there's
some time there some lag
time when we're waiting
for the bill to cross over
from house
appropriations to
have a good hearing
because once it does
that, you know,
the, the
most common thing is saying, well,
we already get the budget
and that's the way we get
the, the
right
information to see
what is needed. And, you know,
we're talking about special
FTEs or
programmatic part.
So I do want to offer
that, you know, I'll bring
that very strong
and I'll start off with bringing
that to the caucus
and then from there that we can
dedicate appropriate
time. And
that's what I'm seeing is that maybe
we could do like, one week
for these issues.
>> That would be great.
You know, what we usually get is an
hour to
make a presentation to
the LFC. But
you're talking about Senate
Finance during
that 1st, 1st
couple of weeks of the session
where the, the
committee's issues could be brought
before Senate Finance.
So that when
anything that didn't get included
in House Bill two in the House
might be added in, in the
Senate, is that what you're
saying? >> 00,
that's what I'm saying. Exactly,
Mr Chairman. And, and
I'm also seeing a weakness
because, um, we
do hear every agency
at least twice.
This is a time that they should be
bringing these issues to
us, you know, and,
and a lot of times we don't get that
information. And
so, you know, this is how can
we tie, you know,
within the agency and
then also how do
the needs as being
identified by the
group, the committee,
you know, to propose,
you know, the proper
funding.
>> And I think the issue there is
that sometimes our priorities
aren't necessarily the agency's
priorities. You know,
things we think they should be
doing may
differ from what
they're asking for it to
do, you
know. So
I think your suggestion
is a great one,
>> Mr Chair
representative. One of the
things that I wanted to bring up is
that the LFC
is comprised of members
of the House
Appropriations and Senate
Finance. And so
I would like to see if we could
take, uh, Senator
Gonzalez's
rep uh recommendation
a step further so
that they, so that Senate
Finance, I'm sorry, the
LFC actually
hears from this committee
during an entire week when
both people with both,
uh, when both
chambers are represented because
legislative finance
actually votes in
December before we
even get to uh
our legislative session
convening. So we don't want to wait
just for Senate finance. We
have so many important issues
that often get left out just
because of what he stated.
Oh, the budget's already been
formed. So if we can
make that happen, Senator
Gonzalez, I think that
we would be in good shape
and that would help us a great
deal,
>> Mr Chair on that point.
One of the things that happens is
this committee sometimes
passes legislation
that doesn't have the funding behind
it and then sometimes
legis uh funding
um passes
to do things that doesn't have the
legislation behind it.
Um And, and I've seen that
in multiple areas
and it's just the lack of coordination
between
um
the policy
and the money behind
the policies. So
I am so thrilled to
hear Representative Herndon
and, and Senator
uh Gonzalez
uh talk about
these things because I've,
it's come to be
a problem. I think
I, I, one of the very
first things I, I worked on
was the Water Data Act,
which was a policy
and it had no money, but behind
it, it, it sort of um
went with junior
funds and the these funds.
And finally, it's getting a budget
after five years,
that's not the best
way to do something that's so
critical to our state. And
I've seen that over and over
again. So I am just,
I really strongly support
and I'm very grateful
for these offers to, to
have more coordination between the
policies that the committees
work on and the
money to,
to enact, to, to fund
those
policies.
>> Um
I've got several things that,
that I wanted to make sure we
don't,
>> I do. That
was
so I, I really
was, and this also relates
to Senator Gonzalez's
offer the scholarship
for grad students in, in behavioral
health. I think we're going to be getting a
recommendation from them
for how much they need
because we asked point blank
and she said that she'd get back
to us. Um,
the director said she'd get back to
us. And I think that,
um, if we want to
move the needle, we've got
to, we've got
to make it possible
for good people to go
into the area.
Um The second,
>> let me, let's just
discuss that a little bit because
what we were hoping that they would
give us was some idea.
Do we want the same
kind of mechanism that exists
for the
existing
graduate student
scholarships which
largely are in stem fields? I
think,
do we want a separate
fund just for
behavioral health fields, which
I thought was
one real viable
option
and, and it would,
they didn't need to do a pilot
program in Las Cruces to
show that that's, but anyhow,
I won't go
there
or would it be better just
to say, opportunity,
scholarship, money
can be used for
graduate education?
Or do we want to say
here's a special program
where if you're willing to
commit to work in New Mexico
for three years,
you can get
this particular
grant to go to
school for >> behavioral >> health,
>> behavioral health. I, I really
appreciate it because Senator Gonzalez
offered, you
know, to bring this to the, the
finance committee.
And, and so I, I just want to
highlight that is something that came
up that we definitely want to
follow up up on
and make sure it happens
because the
build up of the programs we need
just requires people
and um and
we heard stories of some, some
classes not being
full. Um And
so we, we definitely want
to um to
make sure that all,
you know, that, that we
incentivize people going into
it. Um The
other, the other thing was that
telemedicine issue from
other states,
I talked, I think to the
board chair afterwards and it
sounds like the medical
board might deal with it. But
I think we need to follow up and make
sure that happens
because the whole point of
the telemedicine Act was
to expand health care
for the people in our
state
and not allowing for second
opinions or
not
just seems ridiculous.
And I, I think they need
to clarify. At least the
board chair thought that that
was, it was a
misinterpretation of the
rules they passed. But
when you read the
rule, I can see why UCL
A and John Hopkins and these
other other
um places that offer
telemedicine consults
were concerned. And
right now we're in a list of of
place of states. We're
the only one on the list where
these uh these uh schools
do not offer uh
telemedical
telemedicine consults.
So I, I think that's important
that we follow up on
and the compacts.
Um,
it's, we
need these compacts.
And my understanding
is, and I hope
I'm corrected if I'm wrong
is that there are certain members
of the judiciary
who are concerned about
the sovereignty
that is given up when we allow
issues related to the
compacts to be litigated in
other states that,
that gives up our sovereignty.
And I don't believe that it gives up
our sovereignty. It's just a
choice of venue
problem and it's
about where lawyers are going to be
litigating these issues.
So I just don't
agree with that
perspective on it.
And I think that we somehow
need to get these
compacts passed.
Um, because
if our goal is to expand
medical in our medical
care in our state, we
need these compacts.
So we need to follow up
on that. >> It was interesting
to hear the medical board
say that they need their
medical
compact
because they've already taken steps
to expedite
license.
But even beyond that, there
is a need for
because what happens, I guess
is if you're in a
compact, you
only have to apply to the
compact
once. No,
it's every state that you
have to go separately to every state
and maybe it's expedited, but it's
still
50 separate applications
and >> and the whole purpose
is of the compact is to
expand medical care for the people
within the state. So I
think we need to follow up and
really try to educate
those who believe that it's giving
up sovereignty. It's not
a sovereignty issue. It's just a
choice of venue
issue and that
just relates to where it's going
to be litigated.
Um If I were cynical,
I'd say that this is about
lawyers
wanting business, but
I'm not cynical.
Um So
um the other thing
is um
Senator Pope asked
um
uh the
to have an
identification of the
gaps in substance abuse and
alcohol abuse treatment.
Story after story, we hear
is there are not
sufficient
um resources
for individuals um
in the area of prevent or
in the area of recovery
um
treatment
and um and
enough beds. So
I, I think it's important that
we both identify
the need for substance abuse
and alcohol abuse. A lot
of those cases are
self-medication
of mental health issues.
That's my experience with those
kinds of issues at least.
And I think we need to really
focus on building out
a system where we
have
people
at any state being able to
have. I because I've heard
conflicting different
reports about whether
um we have sufficient
beds, whether we have sufficient
resources. I think we need
to study that identify
the gaps because I believe there are
gaps and also
begin to fund the
build out
of um of
these programs.
And I, as you know,
we've worked on a source
of uh
reliable funds for that
with the increase in,
in the alcohol tax, which
hasn't been increased now in 32
years. Um, and
so I, I do think we
need to again revisit
this issue of increasing the alcohol
tax because it has the
added benefit of reducing
consumption.
So that's something we need to
follow up on.
And, um, we had the
public comment by um
Lex. What's
your last name? Garcia, the
new, the new um executive
director. Where is she there?
There? She is. Ok.
Um So I, I think
the pharmacy expansion and
scope of practice. We've
talked about that on
um in
other sessions
and I'm happy to work on
that Mr Chair. I know that's something you're
interested in. And again,
the same goal of
expanding
um medical
care for people
within our state.
Um And then
finally,
I ask the question, all of
our needs have focused on
primary care and
on nursing, whatever, but not on the
specialty services.
And um at some
point, we need to look at the specialty
services. Too many of our people
have to go out of state
um for care. And it's,
it's complicated by,
you can't even figure out where you're gonna
go by
telemedicine.
But we don't have
uh I know that there are gaps in specialty
care because I know
I personally, I have known a lot of people who
have to go out of state for treatment.
Um And we, I
don't believe that we as,
as a state, understand what
those gaps are and how to
fill the.
So that's, that's
my list, Mr Chair. Thank
you. And I appreciate the opportunity
to, to
seek follow up on those
issues.
>> That your
mike, that
last issue you brought up is
one that the special session
is going to come right up
against the,
the issue of
behavioral health resources.
Uh If
we go to mandating
treatment
when we don't have enough
resources now, for people
that are voluntarily seeking
treatment, I, I
was totally disappointed
I have to say just
bluntly in
dohs
presentation.
Um II I
left last, last
summer's presentation in Las
Vegas of the
opinion that the Behavioral
Health Institute was
going to try to
get
license to do drug
and alcohol treatment. I
don't know if anybody else had
that. That was somehow
I got that impression.
Somebody said that,
I think the, the
secretary superintendent
there said that and
yet and then to hear that. oh no,
we're not doing that.
That was. So where are
we going to get these additional resources
if the state's not gonna do
it? And if we're not coordinating
with local government
or if we're waiting around for this,
these things to mystically
happen, ain't
gonna happen.
These things don't just
spring out of the ground after a
heavy rain, like a
mushroom.
Somebody's got to go out there and
work at finding the
buildings and
finding the people to
staff them and, and then
finding the money to pay for it.
But nobody's doing that,
you know, a plan is great.
But if it
never converts
into somebody
finding a desert hills that's
up for sale on the market for
$6
million
that peanut,
why aren't we buying
that? I mean,
it, it just, it, it,
it's, it
doesn't make any sense to
me.
So there's something
missing at
do
and that is they're way too
passive
in, in dealing with this
issue and, and
to hear the turquoise liege
is trucking right
along just contentedly
at 50% of
capacity
and that and
that, you know,
no, so
one solid thing we could
do. And I'm gonna suggest
that some
member of this committee might want to
make this since I
can't introduce legislation
next year, uh
make a point of
introducing legislation
to finance an
expanded footprint
for turquoise
lodge at the Gateway
center which
has
hundreds of thousands of
square feet that are not
allocated yet.
They, they're there. It,
somebody has to build it
out. Somebody has to
pay for that and who
better than the state of New Mexico
right now. So
that, that might be a thing if
we could, if we could get turquoise
lodge up to
expanded double
their current size. And
he said, you know, they
just need more
space.
Now, the reality
is that I don't agree
with him that they have plenty
of people
because,
and, and Sequoia is
operating at half
capacity
and those were in the Albuquerque
metropolitan area,
that census thing
he showed us
that was appalling.
We have the same, essentially the
same number of beds everywhere
except veterans home
as we did four years
ago. So there's no
growth in, in the capacity
of this state to handle
substance abuse and mental
health problems.
There's just none. We, we
haven't added any
>> and, and Mr Chair, I
um I went to visit
the, the Buro County
detox facility, the new
detox facility
and, and they uh
Yeah, they detox
people but then they need
further treatment and
there's nowhere to send them for
the, for further treatment. It's
very sad. It's
just a gap. Like you
detox somebody and put them out in the
street again. That, that's,
they'll just be back.
>> No, I, yeah, we, we were
there too. We, we visited
the Kris campus. It got
terrific facility
but there's that missing thing
after they've gone through turquoise,
they have housing where they
can come back to apartments
and we need more of those.
But somebody's got to be out there
doing this and, and I don't see
any evidence that the
state, you know,
is,
has a, has a,
a targeted
figure. We need
600 new beds
or 100 new
beds or five new beds. I
see nothing of that sort
going on.
So that's
really something that, that, that
doh presentation.
I, I was just, I
was just
underwhelmed by, by what
they're doing.
It was just, it
was just really
disappointing.
Now, the other thing is
there are at least two
or three
other
local governments
that are pushing for
psychiatric
facilities. Uh, no,
four because Las
Cruces is too.
Um, uh, in
hubs, there's a hospital
building
that the city is
proposing to buy a
vacant hospital
and
converted into
a behavioral health and alcohol
and drug treatment facility.
We, we probably ought to
get behind that. I would,
I would suggest that's a
simple there. You have local
government willing to do it. And let's
just help them
out
in Las Vegas. They've got
that epidural
facility right across the
street from the state
hospital. That, that
makes sense. They just
need some operating money
to get that off the ground.
They may need some more capital. They got
a little bit of capital. I don't know,
Senator Campos got him some,
but I don't know if they got
enough.
Then the, the
Eastern Plains, you've got
that coalition of four
counties.
And I don't remember which ones.
Qua
Dacca Roosevelt. I
don't know, there's four counties in the eastern
plains. They got $10
million out of the legislature.
Maybe Roosevelt was part
of that. I don't know, we'll
find out when we go to Portales,
but they have plans, they
want to have a regional
psychiatric facility because
they, they've given up on
state hospital,
uh, you know, as a resource for
the not giving up on it.
But, but it just
doesn't meet their
need.
Actually, they're pretty close to it.
But, you know, because
TUC can carry in Las Vegas are not
that far apart but
anyhow. Uh,
and then, and then Las
Cruces, I think is also
working on trying to expand
psychiatric resources.
So, uh it
just seems to me that,
that, that we just need to light
a fire. And I know
Senator Tallman last year
had $100 million
in, didn't
even get a hearing. I mean, they just
kind of laughed it off.
But that's because the State
Health Department
isn't behind
it. If they
had said, if we had
$100 million we could do
this. But they're not,
they're not trying to expand
what they do. It's just
pretty clear now that they're pretty
content
to, to operate
at a, at a very low
level of
productivity
and, and I, and I just
don't think that's going to meet the needs
of the state. It's certainly not going
to meet the needs if we change
the law and expand
who can be locked up in
these facilities because
we, we don't
have enough facilities.
Now, >> Mr
Chair, I just wanted to let you know
that Mayor Cobb in Hobbs
is a part of our
behavioral health working
group around the state.
And we are seriously
looking at that hospital
that I think was previously
owned by Covent Hospital
that is now empty and
available so that we have
something in the southern part
of the state to address
this issue. Then there's desert
hills right in the center
of the state and then
going up to Las
Vegas. I think there's still a
building up there so we
can cover the whole state. So your
idea is excellent
and we need to follow up
on it. So therefore, you cannot
retire
>> and we can call it the Tallman
Center because
it was Senator Tallman.
That and I, I thought, oh,
come on Tallman
$100 million.
But that,
that's what we need.
That's the kind of resource that we
would need. And maybe you set
it up as a, as a
fund that
can be replenished from time
to time. You know, not necessarily an
endowment because you only get the
interest that way. But,
but a, but a man,
maybe the uh finance
authority is where it's
housed
because they already have several programs
for uh
capital expenditures
for health care. And,
and doing one for behavioral
health makes a lot of sense. II,
I think that's a great idea. Let
me say, let me before we move on
to Larry Martinez,
there were two other things that I wanted
to bring up. Oh,
Jerry Harrison,
his report
out of that. I thought
we should have a
bill
or at least a request to the
LFC when we get our time
before we may not meet a full
week, but a
couple of days or one
full day would be great.
Um Here
are the things he said we needed to have
more support for if we're
serious about
attracting and
retaining uh
health care professionals,
more money in the loan repayment
program.
Um I guess it would be
good. Speak
of the devil. Here he comes.
Senator Tallman.
Ok. The, the,
the namesake
of the Tallman Fund is
here.
Um, um,
the, um,
the issue that was raised
about the loan repayment fund is
we don't know if it works.
I can't believe that.
II I and I don't
know how you would study that,
but why
wouldn't it work if you say
to get the loan repayment, you
have to be willing to work in the
state.
What do you think,
>> Mister Chair? I don't know. I
mean, that's
one of the things that I've been really wanting to
look into and I wonder if we need to
expand the categories,
not the categories, but the
sort of criteria
by which one is eligible
for that fund.
>> Of course, until this last
year, we never put enough money
in there to really study.
There was nothing, you know,
700 people would apply
and 40 would get a loan
repayment. So,
so, but this last year
we put 14 million
in and it's
and it went out the door.
So studying
whether that works or not is
probably part
of that, but I think we do need to keep
trying it. I wouldn't
stop until we have proof.
Um Second thing,
add some money to, to
Jerry Harrison's uh
contract for
behavioral health recruitment.
He's doing that without
any specific funding
and no staff. So add
staff and funding.
Third thing,
whatever the New Mexico Health
Service Corps is
let's find out and give them
some more money so they can
hire more people to do that
work around the
state. Fourth
thing
that fund that we proposed
last year
to set up an
endowment fund,
the interest of which would be
available to local
communities, hospitals
and clinics to
add incentives
to their package for
enticing people to come
to
Fort Sumner or wherever the heck
they're trying to recruit people
so that could cover things like
job for a spouse
mortgage. Oh, and I
and and it was
representative Kate actually
who had brought up the idea
of not just
providing housing
but
portion of the mortgage
paying for a portion of the mortgage
so that the person coming
would be building up
equity in their
house and that would
be another route in
the ground, holding them there
or at least, you know, make
it a more enticing, more
attractive uh, uh,
offer. Uh,
that was her idea. She's gonna,
she mark that
down the case is the one that might want to
do that.
And then the fifth thing was
scholarships, which we have already
talked about
then, was there something
else?
Uh
>> Mr Chair, may I
just ask you to add? You
asked me who was the, uh, the
doctor heading up the
Alzheimer's study?
Janice Doctor
Janice
Kofal
Kou
you to add that
name.
>> Well, this will not be our
only discussion of this issue,
but keep in mind what
we're, what we're,
um, as we go
along and have these hearings,
what we're talking
about doing Senator Tallman, we had
just talked about, uh,
your proposal for
$100 million for
plant physical
plant.
Yeah.
And, and
while, while a lot of us
dismissed that as a harebrained
scheme, we now have come
to agree with you that it makes a lot
of
sense.
Yeah, that is good. It's
good.
Yes. So >> thank
you, Mr Chair. So the other, I
mean, we had a
presentation yesterday
about the MC Os
and
specifically MC
Os Presbyterian is
now responsible for all of the
kids in foster care, but it doesn't
sound like it's really a seamless
sort of thing and
the kids are going to have to be changing
and all that kind of stuff. I, I
would like us to look at what
Connecticut did in terms
of the state.
Um, again,
being responsible for the
administration of Medicaid
money in the state as
opposed to MC O si,
don't know what that might
look like. But,
um, but I think
that, I mean, after yesterday's
presentation it seemed a
bit,
we have too
much to sort
of,
um,
be,
I don't want to say it
seemed very confusing in terms
of how that whole
thing was going to operate.
So, and I know that it's
confusing, you know, it's
been confusing for me. You
know, I had some of, you
know, that I had a,
I was a guardian of a child
and he was on
Medicaid
and I had to figure out
where we could go based on
which MC O we
had and sometimes
showed up at the wrong place and got a bill
for it. So I'd
like for us to look at that.
>> So are you, are you, are you
specifically talking just about
the kids in state custody?
>> I'm thinking that maybe we
want to really think about doing what
Connecticut did and bring
Medicaid back under the
state >> and the
state could then contract
with, with
a managed care company
to administer it.
But they wouldn't be at
risk for it. The state would
be, it would be the state's
money, the state would be
making the decisions,
not the state having to
monitor four separate
MS. >> And if you have
Medicaid, you could go
wherever
you wouldn't have to figure out who
is >> that. That was
so disappointing yesterday
to hear
what
the, the state
is not really
going to be doing the
credentialing,
which somehow I convinced
myself they were gonna do
something.
Somebody said, led me
to believe that, but they're
not, they're gonna leave
it up to each, we'll have four
separate networks,
each credentialing their own
providers and
creating the same kind of
worse because we only have
three. Now we'll have four of that,
you know.
So,
don't, don't ask me why we do
it that way. I see no advantage
to the state from doing it that
way.
And as you said, you show up
to the wrong place, you wind
up having to pay,
we're not getting
it
any other lingering thoughts
that people wanna put
out there as, as having struck
them as, uh, over the
last few days
that there's something they would like
to follow up
on.
Um, I, I
have to say I was really impressed
with our new superintendent of RL
D II.
I don't, that's my
first contact with him. He,
he seemed like a
absolutely
trustworthy person,
somebody who, if he comes before
the committee and says something, you could
say that.
OK. II, I
got it. I understand
what you're saying.
Um
>> Mr Chair, even
though one
of the things we didn't get to talk a lot
about, but Dr
Racy was in the room
yesterday. And one
of the things that's important about
her is that she leads clinical
trials for the State of New
Mexico. And
I, it's really
important that we support
her in her work
because this state where
we need to look at a
variety of,
of clinical trials that
should be going on because of the
diverse population of the
state is incredibly
important. So, I,
it would be really good if
we could bring her back and talk
about these clinical trials
and we don't get enough people of
color participating in them and
they should be because they're often
affected by,
by
diseases in a
different way. And
I just ask you to just think
about that. It's
as we move forward.
>> Yeah. The, the only thing,
what would the
legislature do
about that? I mean, it, it,
>> the legislature support
her with money to help
her advance those clinical
trials and then those
doctors that are coming in from
other states through the compacts
that we're using can help
her.
>> Ok. We'll
put it on the
list.
All right. I thank
you and thanks for the
discussion
and we'll go now to,
uh, Larry Martinez
with Presbyterian and their workforce
challenges.
Good to have you with us again.
Larry,
good morning Mr
to,
>> right. Ok. Can
you hear me now? Ok.
Uh Good morning Mr chairman
and members of the committee and thank you
for uh having
me here and
having the opportunity to
speak.
Uh
I apologize for the
condition of the handout.
Uh We did double
sided. So that's why every other
page is upside down.
But I did find as
I was looking through it myself
this morning that if you just
turn it up and
keep going, it, it
works, you know. So,
so we save some trees
and we're
pleased about that.
Um I
want to acknowledge
the fact that
I agree
very much with the
information that was provided by
Jerry Harrison,
uh who is
uh made presentation on
Monday concerning many
of the issues. And you're gonna see that
there's a uh
consistency in
what I'm saying
about uh the challenges
of trying to get sufficient
be uh providers,
particularly in the area
of behavioral health
uh into New
Mexico.
And I, and I've
fashioned the,
this presentation
based on how it
affects Presbyterian
Medical Services
specifically so that you can
understand what we're dealing
with at the local
level and how it's affecting
us. I also want to say
that I did get a chance to look at the
handout from the New Mexico
Primary Care Association
that Yvette uh
Ramirez, a Ammerman
prepared and has
distributed to the committee and
I there's a consistency there
also.
Ok.
Uh I, I
downloaded it
from the
website.
Yes, it, it's online and I, I
downloaded it and
reviewed it and
I want to acknowledge uh one
of my colleagues, uh uh
danno Tero,
who's here, who is the
head of the Hidalgo
Medical Services.
Uh He is a fellow
colleague of mine and fellow
member of the New Mexico
Primary Care Association
and they are a federally
qualified health
center just like Presbyterian
Medical Services
is, and
he and I have very many
of the same uh
issues that we're dealing
with. He's located
in the Hidalgo County, uh
the southern part of the
state.
And uh I wanted
to emphasize the fact that
we federally qualified
health centers are
really the sort of backbone of
the health safety net
right now because
um there are
many uh people
in need of services.
And the one
wonderful thing about us
as federally qualified
health centers is that
we turn no
one away for
inability to pay.
We serve everyone who
comes to our doors.
Uh There are a lot of
advantages and I'll talk a little
bit about those. Uh
uh In my
presentation,
there are a lot of advantages
to being a federally qualified health
center that uh put us in a very
good position
that uh enable
us to do these things.
I'd also like to acknowledge my
good friend and colleague,
uh the CEO of
the Holy Cross
Medical Service
Center
um uh James
Kaiser, because
we have collaborated and
worked very hard on a lot
of uh
particularly uh
prenatal care
issues with the Romes
project, which I think you
learned about
uh the rural
ob and
access to maternal
services. That's what Romes
stands for.
And uh I was a member
of the governing council
when the project started and
I want to commend Holy
Cross for their initiative
in trying to improve the
percentage of pregnant
women in Northern New Mexico
receiving prenatal care.
The, the the figures we
looked at when
that project started
were absolutely deplorable.
We had 20%
of our pregnant women
receiving prenatal care
in the first trimester
of their pregnancies.
And uh we think we
are moving
the uh
moving the indicators in the
positive direction, probably
not as fast as we'd like
to. But a three
year grant from the
Health Resources and Services
Administration of the US
Department of Health and Human
Services certainly
helped along those lines. And I
want to commend to the
hospital for the work they've done. And
Colleen Derocher, who is
the project director
who accomplished getting
1/4 year of,
of funding. After the
three year grant went
away, we, she
was able to secure a Kellogg
Foundation grant and
we're gonna continue to work on
those issues. I'm
now a
non-voting uh
member of the governing
council because
we modified
the network
and the uh
uh uh manner in which
the project was being implemented.
But I, I have
told uh uh
James and uh
Colleen that I'm gonna continue to be
a part of advocating for that
wonderful project.
It's, it's a great one and they've
done some wonderful work.
Um The
first page of my presentation
is the P MS
Pyramid. And I just want
to point out that we
uh we, we
include this in all of our
documentation. And
what's probably most important
are our focus points at the
very top that we want to
provide exceptional
quality of services
to our patients
that we also uh want
to improve
access to care
for uh
people in New Mexico
who uh don't
have access because of their lack
of resources or because they live
in remote and rural
areas.
And uh we
want to be an employer of choice.
We want people to come to work
uh for us
and with us. And
we also want to
continue what has
been a tradition of financial
strength for Presbyterian Medical
services.
And
I'll point out just the
mission statement
of P MSs,
which is located on, I think
your fourth slide. It
says Presbyterian medical
services designs
and delivers quality
accessible integrated
health education
and human services in
response to identify
community needs
of the multicultural
people of the Southwest.
Uh And let
me say this. Uh I
was born in Espanola,
New Mexico
and grew up
in Velarde, which is
right at the mouth of the
canyon as you drive
up here. And
when I was growing up,
um the
only
way many of us
could access health care was because
of Presbyterian medical
services. They started
off with a small
clinic in the
community of uh
Embu and
Dixon. And you've seen
um there is
a, an Embu clinic in
Rinconada which
is operated by
El Centro, another one of
our colleagues
um as
federally qualified health
centers and Darren
De is now
the uh administrator
for that
uh
clinic operation.
They've got clinics throughout
Northern New Mexico,
but it's still going
strong. My brother
was born in 1949
in the Embu Hospital,
which was both a
Presbyterian
and uh uh
which was a
Presbyterian Hospital
at the time. And that was
before Presbyterian
Medical Services became an
independent private
nonprofit in
1969
which is separate from
the Presbyterian Health
System, which operates the
hospital in
uh Espanola, as well as the
three hospitals in uh
Bernalillo County.
So uh
I will say that
as a child and
as a young adult,
I realize that Presbyterian
Medical Services really did
live up to its mission of
trying to extend health
care to
a, to
populations that don't have
the resources to pay for health
care as well as those of us
who lived in remote
and rural areas and
had a great deal of difficulty
finding anyone to
meet our needs.
Now, we've been a
private nonprofit since
1969.
And, um,
one of the, uh, these
are some of the advantages of being
a federally qualified Health center.
Number one,
we uh
take all payers,
turn no one away.
We do receive what is
known as some section 330
funding, which
generally offsets
what we
provide in uncompensated
care at a rate
of about 50%.
So to give you an example,
one year, um
P MS
provided $8
million of uncompensated care,
we received about $4
million in section 330
funding. While it doesn't
cover all our costs,
it's enough to keep our doors
open and make certain
that we're there to meet
the needs of our
populations.
Another
advantage is
we have what is known as
federal tort
claims protection,
which means that
we are able to lower
our liability and
malpractice insurance
premiums because
if you, if anyone
wishes to sue a
federally qualified health
center, um
it's a, it's the equivalent of
suing the federal
government because we have
the resources and the
support of the
health Resources and Services
administration.
So that is a, a
great
advantage. We
also offer a
sliding fee scale
to anyone who doesn't have a
payer source
for uh
health care
services.
And the way the sliding fee
scale works is that
if you don't have a
payer source, we will
bill the patient for the
services. But if they provide
us with documentation
that shows that their
economic circumstances
are as are difficult
and that they don't have resources,
we can discount up to
80% of bill
charges.
Now, I know my bosses might
get a little upset with me for saying
this. I'm not
gonna confess the way
Jerry Harrison did and tell you
about all my sins. But
uh one of my bosses got
upset with me. He says, you
know, we do bill
the, the clients for, let's say
we, we discounted 80%
of their bill charges.
Uh I was quoted in the
newspapers as
saying, and
we've never taken anybody
to a, a
collection
agency or anyone else
like that for the other
20%.
And one of my bosses told
me, well, we have to try to
make the patients uh
be responsible for
that, but it was a true
statement. We, we don't
take anybody to the collection
agency if they can't pay their
20%.
Um And we don't
uh uh take legal
action or anything else like that.
But so I'm saying it
here in front of the committee
and I guess since I will no longer
be a AP MS employee
after Friday that I
don't have a lot to worry
about,
but, >> uh, it's
also gone out statewide
to,
ok,
>> then I may be in real
trouble
that
and, and recorded.
Right. Well, one of the
thing, one other
advantage of being
a, um,
um,
federally qualified health center
is that we also are 340
B, uh,
medication program,
which means we can
acquire,
uh,
medications
and at a very low
cost and pass
those on to our
patients in their
savings
even though we are a private
nonprofit. And
uh, we take everyone
and we have these
advantages.
Um,
we, we
collect
wherever we can
collect from in terms
of reimbursement.
So we take, we
probably take, and I know we
do for a fact, take
the uh majority
of Medicaid patients in our
areas. We take
Medicare, we
also take private insurance,
but then we also take private
pay. So,
um, we,
we go after a whole
lot of reso resources
in order to
keep the doors open
and the operation going. I
think one other thing is you'll
see in my presentation and
I'm not gonna read to you the
slides. I'll let you read
those at your leisure.
But, uh, we,
we are highly diversified at
Presbyterian Medical
Services. Unlike
some of my colleague
FQHC
members, we
operate the head start program
in four counties.
We operate senior
citizen programs in many
of our areas and we
deliver meals
to the homes of
uh elderly citizens.
We do home
visiting. We do
developmental disability
services up in
uh San Juan
County, uh Farmington
area. Uh
We, so we, we
do a number of different
services and
it's one of the reasons I think
we've got financial strength is
because we're not solely
dependent on just
one funding source.
We're dependent on a
number of funding sources and
we've been able to do that.
Uh One of the slides shows
you that we serve a
close to
80,000
individual und duplicated
patients a year
and we provide
390,000
encounters or
visits
a year. So that shows
you uh
the, the numbers of
people we serve through, through
about 52 clinics
across the
state.
You uh where
the slide is that has
P MS statistics.
You'll see our head start numbers,
our developmental
disability numbers and our senior
citizen program
numbers. But
I'd like to highlight
the tota Behavioral Health
Authority as
one of the reasons I have loved
working for Presbyterian Medical
Services for the last 25
years.
Um
P MS was one of the
first companies
to
serve people
through traditional
means
when Medicaid and a lot of
the other programs still do not even
pay for those services.
But we entered
into an arrangement with
the uh San Juan
County, the city of
Farmington Northwest,
regional Health Center
up in that county, the
Navajo Nation.
And we became
one of the first
organizations in the whole country
to pay for
traditional healing
for behavioral health
and addicted patients
through such things
as sand paintings,
medicine, men,
sweat lodges, and
some of the other more traditional
means of
addressing
addiction problems.
And it has been a very successful
program has been very
well received by the
population
in San Juan County.
And we, I think we've put
together something that can be
replicated in other
parts of the state.
So, uh
uh what I'd also
like to point out
uh now and get down
to the nitty gritty
of where we're
short. There
is a slide that says
provider needs.
We should have numbered these so that I could
tell you what number it is. But
it's, we, we
currently have 34
primary care provider
vacancies across the
state that's
physicians, nurse
practitioners,
physician assistants.
Um
So we are
constantly recruiting
and I, I want to point
out that Representative Herndon
talked about the need
for uh
be having behavioral
health services
for uh students
and Children. And some
of you might recall that there was a
bill that was introduced during
the 2024 session
to put a
counselor in
every elementary
and uh rather every
middle and high school in
the state. And
I believe it was about a $70
million appropriation. And
uh when I testified before
committee along with Nancy
Rodriguez who
is the
executive Director of
the School based Health
Alliance. We both
said we we support
anything that will provide more
services. The biggest challenge
was gonna be finding
enough behavioral health
providers to
fill those positions.
And it's part of the reason, I'm sure
the bill did not get
very
far, didn't have enough
traction. But,
um,
so in addition to having
34 primary care
provider vacancies, we
also have 18
behavioral health
positions that
need to be filled by
behavioral health therapists.
And by the way, Presbyterian
Medical Services does operate
six school based
health centers throughout the
state. Uh I
had two of them when I was
North Central region director
in Santa Fe,
but we also uh
operated uh
uh school based health
centers in
Cuba and Socorro and
a few other communities throughout
the state.
Um
I want to point out the fact that
also it, even
though we are short of
providers, we are
short of support
staff such as medical
assistance and we have
23 medical assistant
vacancies in
this snapshot
of where we are with respect
to
unfilled
vacancies.
We also uh have
six community
support worker vacancies
that have not been filled. And
let me tell you how important
those community support
workers are for people,
particularly those with
behavioral health needs.
The community support workers
are the ones who try
to help the patients
in addressing what their
basic life needs
are such as
housing, such
as food security,
such as employment,
such as transportation
and all the other things that they
need. And those
community support workers are
very important.
The job classifications
are not very
demanding in terms of
what their educational
background is.
But these
workers become
very much a part of our
system and are very much
loved by our patients
because they're the
people the patients
go to when they say I, you know, I'm
getting evicted from my
apartment because I haven't
paid the rent.
Or these are the people who said I don't
have enough money to buy
food for my
Children. And they're
the ones who help them go out and
become eligible
for the state Nutrition Assistance
program. The snap,
uh and who go out and
help negotiate with their
landlords to see if there's some
way we can keep these
people in their homes
and they work with them in terms of
trying to find employment
and transportation and all the
other things that they need just
to be able to maneuver in
life.
We also have 12 vacant
customer access representative
positions and those are the
people who
intake the
patients when they come into our
clinics and
they pull their
files, they schedule their
appointments,
they uh uh
handle their
finances and tell them what
their balance is. If they are
a private payers are
paying out of their own pockets
for their uh health
care needs.
And uh they are
just as important as
everyone else in the system
is because they're the ones who
have the first contact with each
of the patients. And
we train and drill
our front
desk people to
be
as uh
as welcoming
and as warm and
engaging as possible for
the patients so that they
feel comfortable coming into our
clinics to receive health
care. So
those are, those are our
needs and what are our
challenges?
Right off the bat.
There just are not enough
behavioral health, the
therapists around
there, there, there
we are all competing with
each other to hire
them. And
one of the sad
situations that we're
seeing,
uh and by the way, I
want to commend the legislature
for doing the great job you
did in establishing
the rural health care Development
Fund, which has
made more resources
available. But
let me explain one of the dilemmas
we're facing uh
particularly in
small areas,
uh uh small
and remote and
sparsely
populated
areas
frankly, if we wanted
to, if any
organization wanted to set up,
say 10 more clinics in
Burn Leo County in Albuquerque,
that would be no problem
whatsoever
because there is such an overwhelming
need in that
community,
that community could support
10 more clinics.
But when you've got a small
community that
has been served by a
struggling federally
qualified health
center for a number of
years, and
another company comes in and says,
well, we're gonna set up a clinic there
also and they
get some of the subsidy
money. Well,
if they get the award, guess
where they go to recruit
providers, they go to
the clinic that has been
there for all these years.
And if they can give them a higher
salary, they,
the providers
migrate to that
center
and then we have to make the
painful decision as to whether
or not we should stay open since
we don't have any more
providers and are having
difficulty recruiting them.
So, so we may shut
down.
And if
the succeeding
clinic,
once the subsidy money goes
away, find themselves in the same
position we were in before
they may shut down too.
And in those
instances, we
could be hurting
the rural communities
more than helping
them. And
there's what I would
strongly recommend is a
way of us coordinating
among ourselves, are
making certain that there's
some sort of certificate
of need for
a new start up
operation. One
that's not just gonna go in and
harvest and uh take
away our providers
so that they can be
in the business of doing it.
Competition in an
urban area is a wonderful
thing. And we
would certainly support
that in a small
rural area with limited
resources and limited
population. It's
not so good. It does
not result
in us expanding capacity.
And I think I say in my
presentation a number of times
that we, we, we
need, we can't just have the
providers moving from one place
to another taking their patients
with them if
we're not expanding
capacity and more,
providing more providers
to help the
patients? Yes,
Mr Chairman who
>> decided
which
organizations got
those
expansion, rural
health care, expansion monies.
Was it, was it one
department? >> Yes, the human
services department. Now
the health care
authority
that making that
decision? >> And did they
have any kind of
criteria like, like
the one you're suggesting
if there's already an existing
clinic not to
put a competitor
there. >> I don't believe
Mr Chairman, that there was sufficient
time for enough
study to be done
to gather the information
necessary to,
for, for the
decision maker to know
precisely what the impact
might be. I I
don't think that even
and then let me say
I'm not wanting to
criticize the human services
department because,
well, I was a, a long
time employee of the human
services department. I still serve
as the chairman of the Medicaid
Advisory Committee for that
department. What's
now the health care authority?
But uh even
those of us in the business
who are doing it probably
didn't realize
what the impact was going to
be ourselves, to
be able to inform
the state agency that this is,
this is what might happen.
We only, we only see it
after the fact. And a
good example is we had a
struggling, we have a struggling
clinic in the uh
Gallup New Mexico
area. And
another clinic has now been
funded there and that
clinic is now
recruiting our uh
providers
in order for them to staff
their operation. And
it's, it's only after the fact
that we all began to see what the
impact was so
unintended,
unintended consequence,
you know, it was what someone
once said, the, the road
to hell is paved with good
intentions.
And, uh, and maybe
that's what has happened in a few
of our operations, you know.
So I, I'd like to
touch on a few of the
other uh things
and I'd like to commend
Representative Ortez for
recognizing that
we, we,
we have taken on one
of the barriers to
hiring providers and that's
avail affordable
housing.
Um And
she recognized the fact
that we have gone after
HSA grants and other
funding sources
to find
resources to be able to
secure affordable
housing for our providers.
I can't tell you how many times I've been
given calls by
nurses and
nurse practitioners and
physician assistants
in other states who said, you know,
your, your pay
scale in New Mexico is fairly
good. But when I
get on the internet to look for
an affordable house
in Santa Fe, Albuquerque,
Taos,
I I can't afford to pay
for those uh real
estate prices or,
and even to rent
apartments. Now in
Albuquerque and Santa Fe
right now, there's a new
affordable housing
apartment complex
that's been built along with
many others that have already been
built in Santa Fe where
a one bedroom apartment
is $1800 a month
rent and a two bedroom,
one is $2600
a month rent. Well, for
those of us who are old enough
to have bought
houses years ago,
you know, that's more than a house
payment was in those
days and it, and
it's a critical crisis
that we've got, as I've
told, uh, many
of you already.
Um, I have a
dentist at our Questa
Clinic who
is serving us four days
a week and he's living
in his camper
that's parked on our, in our
parking lot there.
And that's we haven't
been able to find him uh
affordable housing.
So, so we're going after
grants to actually build
residences
somewhere
near
our, our uh
clinics so that we
can offer
them affordable housing.
Uh and, and eliminate
that as a barrier
to uh
as a barrier to
uh uh serving in our
clinics, as I've
stated before. There's an
insufficient supply of
providers. The medical schools
are not producing people,
which is why loan repayment,
as Jerry Harrison said, is
so important. The
way we attract people to the
remote areas is if you
come to work for us for three
years, uh either
through the National Health Service
Corps, there'll be
loan repayment or
through the New Mexico
uh program that
you learned about Mr Chairman
on Monday.
Uh If, if we, we
can get funding through
those, we,
that's a real incentive
for someone to go and
work in a rural area.
Did you know about that?
I was aware of it, but I knew
it was also underutilized
and for a number of different
reason, reasons,
but I didn't
realize it was funded so
poorly and that it,
that it probably
needs an infusion
of resources and us getting
the word out to everyone
that we can avail ourselves of
that resource.
Yes. Uh I was
aware of it and uh I
discussed it with uh
Steve Hanson, the
CEO of P MS
and he was aware of it too,
but it hadn't been
utilized. Um
So we, we,
we certainly would recommend
I let me just tell you one real
quick story about uh
how effective loan
repayment is.
Many years ago, we did
have a mobile dental unit
in Santa Fe.
And uh
we uh
we hired a
dentist to
serve our Torreon
Clinic out
near on the western
part of the state near Chaco
Canyon, that area
and he served three years
there uh to pay off
his loan. Then
he got hired by the Indian Health
Services and we
lost our dentist on the mobile
dental unit in Santa Fe.
And when I realized
that he wasn't starting with Indian
Health Services for three months,
I went to him, Doctor
David Hanson
and I said, would you be willing
to serve on the mobile dental
unit? Uh And
to be before you go to
IHS. And he said,
yes, he would. And he did, he served
for three months and
helped us out a great
deal then he went to
IHS and then he came back to
P MS as a dentist. And now
he's the director of our
dental services in the
company. But that
shows you how effective
loan repayment
was in us, having
a provider for three years
in a very remote
area. And
then he turned out to become
now one of our leaders
in, in the company.
Um We don't
have a dental school in New Mexico
and I do want to commend
former State
Senator Manny Aragon
for constantly
trying to do that when he
was in the legislature.
But the nearest
opportunities for
people going to dental
school is Texas, Colorado
and Arizona. We also
seem to have a lot to go to
Creighton. Uh and
those areas, the unfortunate
thing is when they go to dental
schools there, they start
liking the communities they're
in and they stay there.
They don't come back to New Mexico
to serve our New Mexico
citizens. So
at some point in time, I
truly believe that New Mexico
has to have a dental school.
>> Once I've seen Lincoln
Nebraska, it's really, or Omaha
Nebraska, really hard to
get him back here.
>> Mr Chairman. There's
no accounting for taste.
Sometimes
one time I
uh I won't mention
the Southern community, but
uh there was a Southern community
where we
recruited someone to
quesa, the
uh administrator that we uh
attracted to Questa. He
loved it, loved Questa,
loved the countryside,
the hiking and
skiing opportunities so
his wife couldn't stand it.
They went back to the southern
community.
So there's, there's no accounting
for taste. That's what,
uh, uh,
also 11 of the
things that the legislature
did pass,
uh, in,
uh, the
2024 session was House
Memorial 12,
which pointed out
a lot of the licensing
and qualifying barriers for
behavioral health ser
uh providers.
And the Memorial
did call for a study
and we, we are recommending
that study be completed
and, uh,
uh, that
we, uh,
try to do whatever we
can to ease the
burden of,
of some of those requirements
to make it easier
for people to qualify
as behavioral health
therapists
salaries need to be
increased. As I think
Jerry Harrison and both,
uh, and Yvette Ammerman
have recommended,
uh, I've already touched on the
affordable housing
issue, uh, and
the oversight issues
particularly with behavioral, with
respect to behavioral
health,
uh, providers
are retiring at
an, at an increasing
rate because
unfortunately, my generation
is getting old. And as
I told you, I'm retiring from P
MS on Friday
myself.
I'm not retiring,
retiring. I plan to be
around in some
capacity involved
with what, uh,
the, with health care
issues and working
with the legislature. I've
served as a lobbyist for the last
17 years at the
legislature and I've
been involved in the last
50 legislative
sessions. So,
so, uh, some
of you, I'm kind of familiar
to, I'm like a bad
habit. I don't go away.
So, uh, uh,
hopefully I'll be seeing some
of you again during the next
legislative sessions as well
as during these interim committee
hearings.
Um, one of the things
that we, that I
instituted as a
region director, which
I think is one of the strategies
we should be looking at
is when people
retire as
providers.
I've talked a number of
them into
staying on as
temporary on-call
providers.
Uh, and
many of them
love the idea because
they say I'm not gonna be
working as hard as I was working
before. But I keep my
fingers in the profession
and I keep my skills
up. And besides
that, for some people,
retirement is very
boring.
One of my very close
friends who I've worked with for
40 years,
uh Doctor Larry
Lyons,
he retired from P MS
as our clinical
uh vice president
of Clinical Affairs. Uh
because he wanted to devote
his last years to direct
patient care. And he
went into a private
profession, a private
practice, that
private practice went
out of business. So we hired him
again as a provider.
And about three years ago,
he, he
uh
retired
then about six
months after his retirement, he called
me up and says, do you have any work for me
to do? And I said, do
we have some work for you to
do? I said, but what's going
on? He said, well, I'm
bored and
I think I'm getting under my wife's
skin
and now
he's serving for us at
two days a week at
either the Pecos Clinic,
Pecos Valley Medical
Center or the Ortiz
Mountain Health Center in Cerri.
So, and
we were able to talk
uh Doctor Graciano from
Questa into staying
on as a temporary on
call. And I
was able to keep
uh the nurse
practitioner. Uh
Luanne Wasse to
stay on at SOOS
for one day a week.
Uh
Although she's retired
too. And uh I
think that's a strategy. We
need to take
a look at. We,
we need increased
bandwidth to
be able to do more
telehealth care
in the state,
particularly to serve remote
populations. And we need to get the
technology out there to
areas that are more accessible
to them so that we can
serve people. We, we
are providing a lot of
telehealth services
during the pandemic, we did a
lot of telephonic services
but those telephonic services are
not being paid for any
longer by the payer
sources. Now that
now that
supposedly
the pandemic
is, is over,
although COVID is just as
prevalent out there as it
was before. The good
news is we've gotten so many
people vaccinated and I want
to commend the Questa Health
Center, by the way, as one
of the leading
clinics in the state,
uh uh
Steven Kada, our
Director of Pharmacy and lab
services joked
with me one day. He says, you know, I'm
convinced that every living
thing in Questa has been
vaccinated because
the numbers that we were
getting back during the pandemic
of people that were
vaccinated were just astounding
for a, an area that
small, you know, with that small
a population.
But they did a
wonderful job
and I never stopped commending
them as their direct
supervisor for the wonderful
job they did of getting the word
out and getting people
into the clinic to get
their vaccinations.
But so although
COVID is still out
there, there are not as
many people dying and it's not
as severe
uh in terms of
its impact on their
health.
Ok. I think I've touched
just about everything else. I did want
to talk about behavioral health
again because I know that that's what
is so difficult
and I've outlined
the areas we have a very
difficult time trying to recruit
people too. And I
highlighted Socorro Carlsbad,
Artesia, Espanola
and Deming as some of the communities
that are very hard
to attract individuals
to.
Um we
are having to become more
flexible, give
people four day,
10 hour shifts.
If that's what they prefer,
many of them want to
uh work remotely
out of their homes
and we accommodate them
as best we can in that
regard too. Although there
are some patients who
want to be there to meet in
person with a behavioral
health therapist
um
because of the severity and
I and I, by the way, I, I really
appreciated the discussion that
was held earlier this morning
regarding uh the
behavioral health of our young
people. Uh
I, I want to share with you the fact
that in April of
2022
us, Senator Ben Ray
Lujan visited our teen
health center
at Santa
Fe High School and he brought
with him, um
Miguel Cardona, who is
the Federal Secretary
of Education,
who came
and what they were both
very much interested in is
what are you hearing about the
pandemic and its impact
on our youth?
And I know Representative Herndon,
you brought that up
this morning in the discussion.
Um
Our behavioral health therapist
said you know, the situation before
the pandemic was not very good.
We had so many students suffering
from post traumatic stress disorder
because of domestic
violence, sexual assault
in their homes,
uh,
substance abuse,
all sorts of things.
But after the pandemic, it's
even worse because many
of the Children now
have a feeling of isolation.
They lost loved ones
during the pandemic.
Grandparents,
relatives, parents,
siblings.
Uh So we said our
work is only just now
beginning to really
get into gear
because we
have a lot of work to do to
bring, to restore
good health to our,
our Children.
And Secretary
Cardona said, you are the
first people in
this, in, in the
country that I visited
to recognize that
he says everybody else is
talking about its business as
usual when the pandemic's
over and that's
not true. And we said
it isn't. We've
got a lot of work to do
from here on
out.
Larry. Can you jump to the
recommendations?
Let's go to the recommendations
very quickly. By the way, I would
ask you each to read
all about the behavioral health
survey that was conducted
and what people's response were.
But
there needs to be continued support
for federally qualified health
centers and,
and community health centers.
We are the backbone of the
safety net and that's, and
by the way, the legislature
did a wonderful job
in keeping, uh,
in uh $6
million appropriation
request to,
uh a $2 million appropriation
request to
uh keep uh to,
to increase Medicaid
reimbursement for FQH
CS by as much as
6%.
You get a different.
Uh, yes, we
do. And
well, let, let me just give you a real
quick history as to why
this is important
clinics have access to the
rural Primary Health Care Act
that is administered by the
Department of Health.
And we used to receive $11
million a year for
that. And that
money goes direct would
go directly to clinics
when they needed a re roofing
job or
resting of the
facility. That sort of thing. It was
there to support
infrastructure.
In 2016,
that amount was
cut to 5
million from 11 million a
year to 5 million.
And David Roddy and I
were among the lobbyists who were
pushing to get some of
that restored.
We didn't get it
restored until two years
ago when there
was a $2 million
appropriation, but it wasn't
put back into
RCA
specifically for those
purposes. We had to earn it
because it was put into
the Medicaid
budget to be matched
with Medicaid dollars.
And so we can
only get that money if we
serve more Medicaid
patients.
The numbers of Medicaid patients
was reduced after
the pandemic was declared over
because we lost close to
300,000
patients that lost their
eligibility.
So, uh
what was put in was
money to
uh pay for
FQHC
services.
And yes, FQ A
CS have a different rate
than other
providers.
And uh but whether
or not we have earned it, we don't
know yet because we haven't seen
the final accounting for the
expenditure of those funds.
So, >> so what I was getting at
is so when we raised reimbursement
for all Medicaid
services
that didn't necessarily filter
down to you all. You have a different,
you're on a different schedule. >> Yes,
just like the rural
hospitals also have a
different
reimbursement rate and
everything else. All of the
providers have a different
rate and I want to commend
the health care authority
for working
very closely with all of us to
try to make that
reimbursement work.
They, they have supported
it and they want to see us get
it.
But
>> we don't know if it's reached, >> we
don't know if it is because again,
we, we have to earn it based
on the number of Medicaid people
we serve,
you know, eligibles, we
serve. Uh We
think there should be an expanded
and robust repayment
program which
is similar to and this
was done before I heard Jerry's
uh presentation.
Uh You passed
the Workforce Development
and Apprenticeship Fund
legislation, which we think is
going to help us greatly
with medical assistance and
customer access
representatives. Uh
You uh
passed uh affordable
housing legislation.
Uh Senator Nancy
Rodriguez sponsored
it and that, that was
wonderful and we think it's going to
open up opportunities
and I'm heartened to see that
uh congresswoman
uh uh
uh Leger
Fernandez and
uh uh Melanie
uh
Stansbury have are
planning to introduce
legislation which would help
first time
homebuyers with
their down payments.
And anything
like along those lines
would be of great assistance
to us. Also, we
want the house Memorial
12 study to be
completed and
for action to be taken to ease
things up. Used to
be that uh where
the bottleneck was in behavioral
health was that you needed an
independently licensed
behavioral health therapist to
do behavioral health
assessments and, uh,
comprehensive service
plans.
We've eased that up so
that we, it can
be non independently licensed
ones who can do the assessments
also. And that has
helped. But for a
while there, we had a lot of people
in need of therapy and we had
therapists who are available to serve
them, but we couldn't serve
them until they had a BH A
or a comprehensive
service plan done. Now,
we've eased
the pressure at that
bottleneck area, but we have to
ease it more.
And then uh
we do believe
we have to start recruiting
and we have, there have
been efforts to recruit in high
schools uh for
people to go into the
various disciplines,
but we could use a
lot more. Uh
I want to commend
the Kalma Foundation.
They, they went out and started
recruiting nurses
uh in the high schools,
nurse candidates in the high
schools, nurse
candidates who could speak Spanish
as well as Navajo
so that we could
eliminate
uh health
inequities for uh
many of our minority
populations.
But we need to do a better
job of that and we
need to, to make it attractive
and show people
what wonderful
uh satisfaction can
be derived from serving in health
care. So, Mr
Chairman, that's my, my
presentation and I will
formally announce that
uh uh my last
day as a P MS
employee is Friday,
but uh the company
wants to keep me on, on
a contract basis to
serve as
a uh uh legislative
affairs and
local governments uh
advocate.
And I will be doing that.
But I'm also looking at some other
organizations possibly
helping out in that regard.
And I will be very active
in doing this because I
don't want to be bored and I don't want to
be getting into my wife's skin
either. So,
so, uh, but
uh, it's been a pleasure to work
with many of you over the many
years that we've, I've been
at PM si was there
for 25 years, that
was after a 27 year
state government career.
And we will be continuing the
radio program
and I'll be wanting
to interview many
of you for our radio show
Health Paolos on
KSWV Radio,
Kave Radio in Santa
Fe A 10 on your
AM dial and 99.9
on your FM dial. And you
can also stream us on
the internet at
KSWV
radio.com.
So, thank
you very much. >> Thank you,
Larry. And we
have Representative
Ortez first. Thank
>> you Mr Chair and thank you
Larry for all that you've done for
so many years. I, I
regret that we have really
just met
recently.
>> I know, but we'll still
keep working together. >> I'm
so
you, you know, we talked
a little bit about the
Presbyterian working with our
congressional delegation to get
funding, I think through the
congressionally directed spending
or, or was it a HSA
grant to build that
housing? It's for four
units in Cuba.
>> Yes, it a grant.
It's >> a HSA grant. So,
so
other
agencies of their hospitals can
apply for that
as well. >> And we're seeking
to do the same thing in Socorro
and in Artesia
and you're going to see it in
other communities. We're
actually looking at Questa
as being a place where
we would build a residence
for providers. >> I think that
would be very helpful because we're losing.
You know, we all know, we
know that we, we've heard it over the last couple of
days. We know what the, what the
story is. So I think that would
be, I'd love to
chat with whoever
is your contact there to
make that happen because we, we
need to do the same thing
in these communities. >> I will
talk to Sarah Nelson
House who is our
director of operational Support.
She's the key person writing
up the proposals and
she's, she heads
up our grants and contracts
operation and I worked
very closely with her.
She started working at
PMS the very same day I did
November 29th,
1999
and I hope she's
not retiring soon, but
she's younger than I am.
So, >> thank you
for your service. Thank you, Mr Chair. I just
wanted to make sure that I got
the details right. And I'm looking
forward to chatting with Sarah. Thank >> you,
Representative
>> Representative Herndon.
>> Thank you, Mr
chair,
Mr Mr
Prisoner, I just
would like a clarification
on two items. When we
look at the, the
P MS statistics
on providing services
to head start
and to senior
citizens to that program,
where do we find out exactly
what you do? Because
it sounds like you're able,
you are providing services
beyond the
four M
that are with Medicaid.
If people don't have enough money
and they need to see a doctor.
Like where can we
tell our
constituents? This is
another alternative.
So where's that list
>> we can provide
to the committee list
or you can get on our website
and you'll see every
P MS clinic
that is that we
have operating.
Now, let me point
out we don't
have anything in
Albuquerque itself
because P MS
always was attracted to
the rural and remote
areas. We do have two
clinics in Rio Rancho.
Uh but we in
the early days of P MS, we
were in the northern and the western
part of the state. Now
we have clinics all the way down
to the south uh
western portion of the state,
but we don't have anything in Las
Cruces. Uh
But uh
my colleague
at la
Clinica de la familia
in Las
Cruces are there.
And uh a and
as Hidalgo medical
Services is there also
if you, I I
I'm, I did
look at Yvette Ammerman
s presentation to you. But
uh the New Mexico
uh primary Care Association
would have a list of every
clinic in the state including
non P MS ones.
But if you look at our website,
you'll see every clinic
and most of us are
involved in Dan, I'll ask
you to either affirm or deny,
but I believe you've
got staff who do
navigation and
enrollment.
Yes, most of us
do. We can enroll
people in Medicaid.
We can, we can help
people enroll in snap
and, and in other,
finding other resources that
they need. So if they
come to one of our clinics,
we can generally
uh uh provide
them with a staff member who will help
them become Medicaid
eligible because it's,
it's more advantageous for them
to do that than to be, try to
beat private payers
if they're very poor
anyway. So, but,
but if they
need our services
and don't qualify for Medicaid,
we will give them
the sliding fee scale and explain
to them how we
can discount quite a bit of
the bill charges.
>> Thank you. And, and
just for
clarification, what's the
turnaround time if people
need to see a physician
there right now,
we're looking at long wait times.
Is it shorter in your P
MS clinics? >> Uh,
we have always
ourselves in
setting aside
time every day
for walk-ins
and we will take walk-ins
on that day. We also
many of our clinics, we do
same day appointments.
Uh, and it's
partially because
being a, uh
community health
center, we've got,
we, we've
traditionally had sufficient
numbers of providers.
Now, one area that I
will tell you has always been
very difficult is dental
because there are so few
dentists, there
are long waits for those
services. But I'm, I'm happy
to report that at our Santa
Fe Family Health Center.
We've just recently hired three
dentists at that
site and they
are working full
speed
with the minimum of wait
times. But, and
particularly with respect to
behavioral health,
we don't want to put off
anybody's
care
simply because we don't have a
provider there. We, we
try to schedule them
immediately because
someone who's suicidal,
someone who's depressed,
suffering an
anxiety disorder,
um or
postpartum depression,
those sorts of things, we need
to see people right away. So
the wait times in most of our
places and I, I think I
can say that across the board for
most of our members
of the association, Dan, would
you agree? We,
we have very minimal
wait times
>> and just one final question
and clarification. Mr
Chair Mr
Presenter. Now you talked about
uh
Congresswoman Teresa
Ledger Fernandez putting forth a
bill to help first time
homebuyers with
the down payment. So
what I'm trying to determine
is how does that differ from what
ma currently has? So
they will help first time
homebuyers with their down
payment and with their
home up to
$310,000.
How does it differ from that
program that's already
here? >> Ok, Mr
Chairman and Representative
Herndon, I, I haven't seen the
details on the bill
but both Congresswoman
Stansbury and Leger
Fernandez have proposed
this
in most existing
housing assistance.
There, there are very
specific income
limitations.
Uh I think
what they're seeking to do
is expand
the uh
eligibility base
because the
public schools in Santa
Fe Chris to Saint Vincent
Hospital, they have used
those uh
home wise
type funding sources
for nurses,
nurse practitioners,
for teachers, teacher
assistants. But
I think what the
effort on the part of
the uh congressional
delegation is is to
expand it. So it's not
limited to just this
certain band
of people with
incomes, uh a
lower or higher
end of income that are eligible
for it. I think
they're go, they're wanting to
expand it so that there is a
greater population that can
receive assistance
through that program.
And, and we haven't seen the
legislation yet,
but I believe that that's
what their intent is, is
wanting to make it more
wide uh widely
available to
people. >> Thank you, Mr
Chair. Thank you, Mr
Presenter.
>> So I'm, I'm next on
the list.
Um So I have a question
in terms of the
um we had a
presentation, I think it was
yesterday from the health care
authority and
they, one of
their
um
pages show that
the F QHS are going to be getting
a rate increase
in October.
Do you? I'm sure
you're aware of that. And
can you tell me, can you give me a little
bit more detail because we didn't get
detail on that
during the presentation,
>> what the increase
will be is
the Medicaid
rate for
various services and it's
all over the map,
it will go up by
about uh
6%.
And now
again,
it's, it's
going to be dependent on what the actual
services it's provided. Like
a physician visit,
filling of a prescription,
you know, whatever the
service is, a behavioral health
session, therapy
session,
the rate will go
up. And what
I was discussing with
the chairman
is that it's different
in that uh it, it's
all dependent on who comes
in and who
is Medicaid eligible
and receives the services
as to the
payments that we are going to
get for that.
Uh And that's why we don't
know precisely
see before
that, when
the funding that
had been available through the,
through the Rural Primary
Health Care Act or
RCA, that was just a
categorical grant that went out
to whichever uh
clinic needed. It
this way, it's
all going to be dependent on
what service is being
provided
and
they're
coming in and getting the
service and then us getting
reimbursed for it.
>> And, and then my other question is,
were there some services
that the FQ HCS
were not being reimbursed
for that? You're not that you are
now going to be
reimbursed
for
>> Mister Chairman Representative
Chavez. I don't believe
so. I think
I'm pretty
sure we were reimbursed
for everything that's covered
in the title 19
state plan
that's approved
by the
Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid services for the
state of New Mexico. So
yeah, I don't believe there were any
service. What, what
Medicaid is
and the health care
authority are now discussing
is paying for things they hadn't
previously paid for,
for anybody such
as chiropractic services.
And that's what I
mean. But they have,
they are proposing and
I would like to commend the
health care authority for
wanting to get at the root
causes of poverty.
Now, uh they,
they wanna uh
start distributing
meals to families
with poor nutrition
situations or with
chronic
conditions
such as diabetes or high
blood pressure, that sort of thing.
They, they want to pay for
chiropractic services. I think
there's even duration being given
to acupuncture
as a service.
So
what, what the
health care authority
has basically stated
and I think that we'll
see follow-up action in that
regard is that
they, they want to, to
turn
Medicaid not into just a
payer for services that are
received by sick people.
They want to see
services paid for that are
improving the health status
of the population. And I
think that's highly
commendable. What about
nutritionists?
I believe. Well, we
already Medicaid dollar
does pay for some nutrition
services. Yes.
But I think there, there's an
effort to try to expand
it. >> Thank you, Mr
Chair
Senator Tillman. You,
you're gonna seek a one word
answer.
But then I, some,
since I talked to
you another thought came up.
So it might be
anyway. Uh Thank you, Mr
Sharon. Thank you for your interesting
informative
presentation. So,
uh how many employees
do you have budgeted? Not the number of
employees you have on actually
working? How many do you
have?
>> I believe I state in
the, it's 1300
total employees across the
state.
Mr Chairman and Senator
Tallman. I thought
I had that statistic in
here as we, in
fact, let me see. I think
it's so
>> that's, that's pretty, it's about
a 7% vacancy
rate because you, you said you had 93
vacancies
>> that's only among
providers,
but we've got other employee
positions that are vacant
also such
as
this
was >> it, it's not
a comprehensive. You have
more vacancies. >> Yes, we do
such as our maintenance
people in our
facilities.
We, we,
the ones
I concentrated on in this
presentation were the those
who provide direct patient
care. Those are the
people that
>> so one follow up
question and I'll be done, Mr
Chair. So
you said earlier that,
uh, your wait times
are, are pretty low. So with,
with that kind of vacancy rate, how can
you have low
rate,
>> Mr Chairman and Senator
Talman. I'm glad you asked that
question because
we like all the
other health care providers
out there are relying
heavily on locum
tenants.
We hire
temporary providers
from private organizations
who have them traveling
nurses and so forth.
That's very expensive.
It's not very cost-effective
for us. We don't pay for any
benefits for those people,
but we pay a very
high rate for
that service.
And, uh, we've
been relatively successful.
I think we've become a little more
skilled to in being able
to move people
around within our
organization when there's
a definite need.
Uh, uh,
when I became region
director back in
19,
uh, back in 2000, that was the
year 2000,
we never
moved providers
around by the time I left,
we were moving them all over the
place to fill in a
need when it was needed, but
we do rely on a lot of locum
tenants. >> Thank you for that
answer. That's
all I have, Mr
Chair,
Senator Leo
Lopez.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and
congratulations on your retirement,
Mr Martinez. That's, that's really
good. And I'm glad you're gonna keep
busy. That
that's, uh, we don't want
to lose your expertise and your years
of service and your everything
that you offer. And I also
wanted to give a shout out to
Presbyterian. My mother
just recently had a, a
heart procedure, a valve
replacement and the care
she received was, was just
excellent. Um
And also, you know, the
insurance was just perfect.
Um It couldn't have gone better.
Um
I noticed in your,
but moving on to questions,
I noticed that in
your uh recruitment and
retention challenges, you, you
said ever-changing licensing
board requirements cause
recruitment challenges that create
barriers in recruiting.
But you didn't have a recommendation
about that. Um
With the compact, do,
does, does your organization
support
um
the compacts
that >> we do,
we support the compacts.
But the one recommendation
that probably directly addresses
that issue is the
House Memorial 12th
study because
we think that
one thing we've learned
is that if you
are a provider with
a private practice,
you're not scrutinized the way
those of our providers
are because of our
public
financing
situation.
Uh And
many of the things
that are required
that we've looked at, say that,
you know, we understand the intent,
but it doesn't really accomplish
what the state was
trying to, uh,
be enlightened
on in terms of our
practices.
And if it's not
a very meaningful,
a process,
a monitoring visit or
something along those lines,
then maybe we should get
rid of that.
Or the fact that
we, we, we
have, we are
accredited by the joint
commission, uh, Presbyterian
Medical Services is so
we meet joint commission
accreditation standards,
which means every three years they
come in and they survey us
very closely to see that
we're following all the rules and
providing quality
care. They look at our
files. Uh
and, and we have a
lot of internal mechanisms
where we look at our
patient files to see that we're
doing proper
documentation that we are
doing the appropriate services
that, that they're related to the
service plan
and that sort of thing. But uh
oftentimes the state
agencies come in and they
want to take a look at the same
things, you know, and
if anyone recalls
the infamous
2013
Behavioral Health
audit, I'll,
I'll give you an example of
a, an activity that seemed
to make no sense
when we were being audited by
the uh Massachusetts
firm that alleged
that we all were
uh inappropriately
spending Medicaid
dollars
when they were going through our files
for Behavioral Health Services.
They said, well, you
don't have the
documentation showing that
the community
support workers had their
mandated 20 hours
of training each
year.
And we said, no, we don't have it in the
patient files, but we've got it in
our centralized human
resources files
in Santa Fe. And we can give those
records to you if you want to see
them. They said no, don't
worry about it. But then when we got
hammered in the
audit, it was because we
didn't have evidence
of the training for CS W
workers in the patient
file in a
patient file.
So that's that to me
is an egregious example
of an activity that didn't
seem to make any sense,
particularly since we said we've
got the information. If you want
it, we'll make it available to
you. >> But
those problems have been
alleviated or do you think they're
still over? >> There
are still a lot of,
there are still a lot
of elements
for state and federal
oversight
that exist,
which I need to probably
be reviewed to see if
does this really get the
information that should be
looked at? >> And a lot of
times, Mr Chair, that oversight
is designed for institutions
that aren't as excellent
as, as Presbyterian,
they're designed for,
for other
kinds of institutions. The
other question I had with regard to your
recommendations is one of
the things that U and M
recommended was that
Medicaid
provide
enhanced
reimbursement for language
access. And you
mentioned language access. And
again, I didn't see that in
your and I'm happy
to say that we,
we, we
talked to the individual
responsible for this, for
working with the Federal government
on our, our alternative
plan and
they, they were
looking into this and, and trying
to get that done. I was wondering
if you support that as
well, >> Mr
Chairman and Senator. Yes,
we do support that. But
let me tell you our experience
and one of the reasons when I
first went to Presbyterian
Medical Services, we had
stipends that were paid to
providers and
staff members who could speak
another language.
And uh
then an
issue came up one time in
our human resources
uh
department did a
study of the people
who claim that they spoke
Spanish or spoke
Navajo or spoke
any other language that we
needed for our patients.
And they found out that there was
no standardized
objective means of determining
whether or not they really could.
What they basically said
was we found a
lot of people who claim to
be Spanish speaking, who were not
Spanish speaking.
And so they, at
that point in time, the
company decided,
let's just try
to raise standards. And,
and we also make
as one of our conditions
when we post a
position, uh
Spanish speaking or
Navajo speaking
preferred
and we,
we pay
bonuses, sign on
bonuses for a lot of people. And
some of it's related to the fact
that we'll increase the
bonus size for a
person who does has
shown they can speak
the language.
>> Thank you, Mr
Chair. And it's even more complex
than that because my mother's
experienced interpreter,
which are awful
because the level of
Spanish that they use
is the level that the
doctor is
using
and she can't understand
it. Um Whereas if she
gets somebody who speaks
local and her
dialect, as you know, there's a new
Mexico dialect, she
understands it perfectly.
Um, so she'd much rather
have somebody who speaks the
dialect,
talking to her, you know, a
doctor who speaks a dialect,
a nurse who speaks our local
dialect rather
than an
interpreter.
That, that is just
in unintelligible.
>> Absolutely, Mr Chairman,
I couldn't agree with the Senator
more. I'll just give you
one quick experience. My
son worked at a
pediatric practice
in Albuquerque for
a number of years
and he took a course
on medical
Spanish
because he served as the
uh the interpreter and so
forth. And
um he, he said
the same thing. He said
there are so many
dialects of Spanish
and by the way, one of my nieces
is a
phd in
Spanish and uh now
a professor at the University of Arizona
in Tucson. And
she, and she's told
me she's Larry,
there's no such thing as
a incorrect
Spanish, you know, because I, I
tell her, you know, I speak
Spanglish from Northern New
Mexico. One day
I, I told
one of our workers who was from
Mexico who was very
upset because one Angela
Madrono who was
former Deputy Secretary
of uh Human
Services, she was leaving
as my school based health administrator.
And this lady who spoke
no English, she kept
saying Porque Porque and I said,
Porque
Ole and
she looked at me like, what
planet is this guy
from? And,
and Angela looked at me and
says, Larry, you are so ghetto
and I, I I said, no,
I'm not ghetto. I'm barrio. We
don't have ghettos in Northern New Mexico.
We have barrios, you know.
So, but that
shows what it is.
And when I mentioned the fact
that my son had had this
course on
uh uh Spanish
literacy and
medicine,
I was inundated
by about 10 people who
came up to. Where do you take that
course? We need to, we need
to send some people there, you know,
so this is going to be
an ongoing issue, but
we are struggling with
it, but we're dealing
with it in what we
believe is the most effective
manner. >> Well, it
sounds like you could communicate with my
mother
and then my final
question has to do with this
telemedicine issue
that, that
I've had
experience with.
Um and I've actually now
talked to other people
kind of have this, this
problem. Um
Have you in? So
my understanding with
Presbyterian is it doesn't
have some kind of
cardiovascular
stent
clearing aqui
or didn't have it, but then
they recently got some
stent clearing
equipment that is state of the
art that didn't function
properly. So, these
patients were referred out of
state and, and were
not able to uh
get uh
an additional consultation without
having to travel. And
of course, since they have heart problems,
travel is very difficult.
So, um would
you agree that there's something
wrong with the with
or not wrong?
What's the better word that the
way that the
rule is drafted in
New Mexico about telemedicine
is a barrier to our
patients.
>> Mr Chairman and Senator,
the issue you've raised
is one which is
related to inpatient
hospital services which
we PMS do not
do. That's
Presbyterian health
systems does.
And they've got >> to
Presbyterian Health
Services about it. I'm really
concerned
>> and, and they are
colleagues of ours. We,
they are a major, we
take care of patients
that are covered under their
insurance plan.
We have agreements
with Presbyterian
health systems to provide
care when they're discharged
from the hospitals
and so forth. But that
is a question that would, should be
more uh
directed to, to
Troy Clark and the Hospital
Association or, or
to uh
um James
Kaiser, the CEO
for Holy Cross
because I don't,
I personally don't know. And I don't
think anyone within Presbyterian
Medical Services unless they've
got inpatient
experience would
have an opinion on
whether or not the rule
is appropriate for New >> Mexico.
Thank you. That's Troy Clark.
And James Kaiser.
>> Troy Clark is
the
director of
the New Mexico Hospital
Association
and James Kaiser was here
this morning earlier. See
James, are you?
He left? Ok. Yeah,
he's uh he's the
CEO
for Holy
Cross Medical
Assistant.
>> Yeah. Ok. Well,
thank you. And again, thank you so much for
your service, Mr >> Martinez.
Thank you,
Senator.
>> And um I just want to
clarify for the committee
that uh
house Memorial 12
did pass
uh one of the sponsors of
it is Representative
Herndon.
That study is
begun, the
work is going on
and a report will be made
to our committee by
November 1st. Very
good. So
excellent Juliani, you can
relax. It's all
right.
Um And I had a couple
of questions for you, Larry real quickly
because we the next
presenters are already here.
Um
um
Do the hospitals?
Oh, get to apply for that
rural health
money,
rural health care Development
Fund. Did hospitals
get to apply for that? >> Mr
Chairman? I believe they do.
>> Were they the ones competing with
you?
>> The ones the
ones that competed with us
in Gallup
were, were not hospital
affiliated.
They were former
hospital providers
that but I
believe some of the hospitals,
particularly those that have some
outpatient clinics
did apply for some of the
funding >> because
it just seems to me that
we've given them
any number of
additional
financial
revenue
streams over the last couple of
years and for them
to have jumped into that one which
is really intended
for nonhospital
thing. I
>> Mr Chairman, I, I did
see a few of the
lists of the applicants
and so forth. And let me just
say that on the part of
the hospitals that did apply for
the funding, it was to, to
achieve what the act had
established, which
was extending health care
to rural and remote areas
they were. And
many of the hospitals have
been real pioneers in this
area. I Holy Cross is one
of them Christa Saint Vincent.
I served on the board of directors
for six years with that
hospital. They,
they've gone to great
lengths. They've got outpatient
clinics in Pahu
and elsewhere
places where they
are really trying to reach out.
And, uh, I, I think they
just recently opened up another
clinic in the Las Vegas,
New Mexico area
also.
>> Um, and
you, when you talked
about, uh,
rural federally
qualified health centers
having tort claims
protection
by their affiliation with the
federal government, You can still get
sued though, can't you?
>> Yes, we can. Mister Chairman.
We are sued quite
often.
>> So, so what is the federal
government's protection? I
mean, do they send lawyers
or
>> they provide
us with counsel quite often
if it
is elevated
to a certain level? But
the major benefit
we get from that
protection is
that
it greatly lowers our
malpractice and
liability insurance
policies.
So be because
we have that added
resource to
consult with whenever we
are sued. You know,
most of the lawsuits that, that
are brought against us
are at a fairly low level.
You know, if someone's not happy
with the, uh,
outcome of some dental
work they received or something
along those lines, you know,
there seldom
do we get any wrongful
death lawsuits and things
along those lines. But,
but yes, we,
there are times when legal
counsel is made
available to us in
some of the lawsuits.
>> And do you still have that
plan or that, uh,
pilot project?
You, you were running a few
years back where
you took, um,
um,
I forget what it was called. Where you
got paid in advance
to keep a population
healthy.
>> Yes, Mister Chairman, >> what did you
call it? >> It's a value-added
contracts with
the managed care organizations.
Do you have that?
We still have contracts
with the,
the three,
I think the four entities
now that are a part of turquoise
care, which are
Presbyterian Blue Cross, Blue
Shield,
Alina and
UnitedHealth. >> So,
so they give
you money ahead of time,
they define a
population
and then
you keep that population
healthy and,
and, and how has that
worked out? >> It's, it's worked
out quite well. Uh
because
uh
and I can speak mostly
to what the previous arrangement
was under uh
centennial care
because we have a track
record there. We to
today yesterday or
if no Monday was the day that
turquoise care became
official. But
uh the way it worked was this,
they paid us
because they said,
you know, the patient population
out there and you've got
better access to
them. So,
what we did was we start
calling up the people that were in the
specific plan. Let's
take Presbyterian, for
example, we
said, uh we'd
like you to come in and
have a checkup so
we can see what your health situation
is and detect
any problems that you might have
and start treatment right
away if you need it.
And we were able to get
people into
our clinics. We
did checkups.
We uh uh
they saw that they
could come to the clinic and get
health care whenever they needed
it and didn't need to
go to the hospital emergency
department whenever
something arose.
So it was working
out quite well. It was,
uh, and we got paid
the, the, the, the
better, the greater the number
of people we saw
and the, the reduced
number of people going to the emergency
department resulted in uh
enhanced payment for
us in that
regard. And I think it was a
very good partnership and
should continue to be a
good partnership with
the turquoise care
providers. Uh
MC OS in
making sure that people
understand they've got access
to primary care
resources >> and, and they don't have
to wait until they,
they have such a bad
problem that they have to >> go
to the hospital. Right. That's
correct, Mr Chairman.
>> Well, lots of
issues you brought up some good stuff,
made some good recommendations.
We appreciate all the work you've
done and good luck
with your new career as a
consultant and
lobbyist.
>> Ok. Thank you, Mr Chairman.
I look forward to working with
you. I hope you will
continue to remain
uh active in the
health care field for all of
the contributions you've made.
And I will tell the uh
members of the committee many,
many years ago, you were my
supervisor when you were the social
services division
director at human services
department >> and,
and one other comment,
Senator Pope has a
competing uh
media uh
project. He does
uh podcasts. And
so you may want to be a guest on
his. If you'll put him on
yours, he'll put you on his.
>> We would love to have Senator
Pope on our program.
>> All. Very good.
Thanks >> Larry. Thank you so
much. OK, >> we have
one final pres presentation
today with the people
from Sandoval
Regional Medical Center who we're
gonna present
on
and here's the name. So we have
Adrian House
Carol. Good Regina
mcguinness,
Nicole Wera
Gigi Rouss,
Vanessa Gutierrez,
Laura
Rector.
I think that's everybody
good.
Are you all gonna speak or are you just
gonna be avail you're all gonna say
something
on video. Oh
and some on
video.
>> Thank you, Chair Ortiz Pino and
committee members for the opportunity to
speak with you today.
My name is Adrian House.
I am a registered nurse and the
chief organizer for the United
Health Professionals of New
Mexico
A FT. We are
a union representing the nurses
and other health professionals
of U and M Sandoval
Regional.
I'd like to start with a
Maya Angelo
Angelo quote
that our members actually
ironically found in an
email from Adam
Crosby, the Sandoval
Regional Medical
Center's Emergency
Department director.
He said he wrote
or he had on his email.
I've learned that people
forget what you said,
people forget what you
did, but people will
never forget how you made them
feel today.
You're gonna hear from frontline health
care professionals and
our patients about how
hospital management
has made them feel
disrespected,
dispensable
and very concerned about the
quality of care that
patients receive.
But first, you'll hear from a patient
about how the hospital's lack of
proper staffing left
her feeling unseen,
unheard and
unsafe. Let me
introduce Carol, a recent
patient at U and M
Sandoval and
frankly, and she frankly
had a miserable death
defying experience at the hands
of flying temporary traveler
nurses
locum whom
the hospital seems to feel comfortable
with. Instead of fixing the
problems that recruit would,
would recruit and retain
permanent RNS.
Like Carol,
Carol.
She's on Zoom
>> Leo. You
have.
Oh, you got
it.
Ok.
Yes.
If, if you could, if you could
speak up, you're very
faint.
Ok.
Much better. Thank
you.
Thank you, >> Carol. Thank
you, Carol. Um I have
several employees that are here with me
today and they'll give you
also a brief but firsthand
description of some very real
troubling patient
encounters.
Um Our patient, their patient
care concerns. The
first one was denied her
PTO yesterday to come up here
and testify. She's
having her paid or
unpaid, her unpaid
lunch break. She's
also on Zoom waiting to testify
to you,
Vanessa
Rick.
Yes, the chair and the committee
can hear you,
Vanessa.
>> Thank you,
Vanessa.
>> Yeah. Hi,
I'm Nicoleta. I'm
currently a licensed social
worker at UN M Sandoval
Regional Medical Center.
I'm approaching my fifth year
of working there. Currently,
I am the only um social
worker for all ambulatory
clinics. So I get to
travel around all our
outpatient clinics frequently.
Uh One of the main reasons
why I'm here today is because of the safety
issues that have I've been
coming across lately.
Uh We are acutely
short staffed so
that impacts our patient care
tremendously. Patients
are waiting extended
amounts of time to get in
with specialists,
primary care providers.
Um The consensus
around the hospital when I ask
around, why are we so
short staffed, it's due
to disrespect from management
is the first one. The
second one always comes across
as pay. So
apparently
we are the most
underpaid working
group of healthcare professionals
right now at UN MS R
MC. One
of the reasons why I stay
there is, you know, I live
close by, I'm part of
that community devoted
to my patients and the
others that have stayed there as well
for such a low pay. Same
reason. So,
um I'm here today to just
say, you know, if we did have the union,
I believe that that would give our
employees, especially
people who are afraid to come
and speak with management.
It would give them an outlet. It would give
us a way to be able
to try to improve
things, impro improve the
working relationship
and get some more
healthcare professionals who are
actually devoted and want to
stay uh within
our health care system and
help get these patients
back to where they need to be, which is
healthy.
>> Um All right. Uh Thank
you, Mr Chairman and committee
members. Um I
appreciate the opportunity to speak
before this hearing today. Is
it not
on?
Have I heard that was
not
what you said?
Can you hear me? All right.
Uh Thank you, Mr chairman and committee
members. Um I appreciate the opportunity
to speak before this hearing
today. Um I think
it's important that you hear from the
frontline workers
um at Sandoval
regional um
and not just take the word of the hospital
that everything there is fine.
Um I'm in our, my name is
Laura. I'm in RN in the
emergency in the emergency
department and I have a lot
of concerns about the state of care
we're able to provide to our
community. Our
hospital is the primary
source of care for so many people
in the surrounding areas.
This essential care is
limited by an inadequate
number of nurses on each
shift. Un
MS R MC deals with
staffing shortages by
bringing in travel nurses to pick
up the slack. This means
there are always new faces showing
up, staying for about three
months and then moving on to their
next contract.
Then a new round of fresh
faces show up and the cycle
repeats. I like
to say that er nursing is a
team sport, knowing the
skills and special talents of the nurses
on your team helps everything run
smoothly with a constant
stream of new travelers.
The full-time nurses don't know
what the skills or level
of experience are. Of those
travel nurses,
travel, nurses get two days of
orientation before they're out
on their own. That's hardly
enough time to learn the layout of the
department where supplies
are kept unit procedures,
etcetera. cetera. The full
timers do our best to mentor and
assist them but it causes
delays in emergency
care. Delays can be the difference
between life and death.
Staff, nurses are left to pick up
the slack and fill in the gaps created
by this constant stream of new
faces. I find
myself always keeping an extra close
watch on all the new
travelers.
I recall a situation where a
traveler was going to medicate a
patient and had pulled up two
very commonly used medications
in the same syringe.
This caused the medications to
precipitate and this
nurse had no idea that
that was a bad thing.
Luckily, it had been caught
before it was administered to the
patient. The nurse was
educated on why that was
wrong. And I learned that I
need to keep an extra watch on
those new faces until I have time
to learn their skills and actual
experience level. I
can't think of another business that
depends on fly in help on a regular
basis. In our case,
we're talking dependence on fly
ins for saving people's
lives. We need
consistent staffing levels
with full-time
nurses
and other health care professionals.
The hospital needs to step up
and do
better.
>> Let
me,
can you hear me?
Ok,
Mr Chair and committee members
members. My name is Regina
mcguinness. I've been a therapist
at UN M Sandoval for
the past 11 years.
Sr MC was a really good
place to work when it first
opened. I couldn't find any
disgruntled employees anywhere.
Everyone was happy and
helpful and most
importantly, they felt
valued,
but it's been a slow progression
downhill with the last
few years being the worst
benefits like paid
time off have been taken away
from us. Positions
are not being filled.
I've found that I make $8
less an hour than my
counterparts at UN
Mh with the same years of
experience, but we're
all the same company right.
Here's a situation that I see
regularly with not enough
physical therapists, a patient
with say a total knee replacement
will either have to stay in the
hospital longer to get
PT or they
will be discharged without getting
PT altogether. That's
just not right.
Why is it happening
to save money? But
actually, it's a self defeating
policy. They're
losing staff because of mi
miserable conditions.
So they have to pay a lot more to
hire temporary
traveling nurses
and healthcare professionals to
fill those staffing gaps.
And if they don't hire those
temps, they can't provide
the services
and to add salt to that wound. They're
hiring a traveler for
a PT position in my
department for likely
100 and $20 an
hour. I make
less than half of that and I've
been at the hospital for 11
years. That's
so insulting.
Why is the hospital so
resistant to a union
to our union and a
contract? They
obviously
don't want to give up power or
money. Their hope is that
our union will give up.
Well, let me tell you, we won't give
up because that
because what we want,
what patients want and what they
need is better
patient care standards.
They should,
this should be what the hospital
wants as well. The
frontline workers have ideas
on how to make things better and the
hospital should be willing to work
with us not fighting
us. I have
one ask of you all,
please pressure the UN
M Sr
MC to come around to
the bargaining table so we can
work on such on solutions
together. It's the best
way to turn around current patient
care conditions. Thank
you for listening to
me.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair
and committee members for letting
us speak.
Um
My name is Gigi
Russ. I'm an RN on a medical
surgical floor at Sr
MC. I've worked at the
hospital since
2016.
I can say with certainty that
the quality of patient
care has definitely gone down over the
past few years
and it's not because
all of us aren't doing our
jobs, nurses and
all staff,
we're doing the absolute best we can
under the circumstances.
It's that we have so many
patients and not enough nurses
and other staff to handle the
patient load.
The hospital should abide by a
standard staffing ratio
preferably for
patients to
one nurse. Yet
our patient load is high
even with charge nurses
taking on not
just one or two patients but a
full
load,
which they shouldn't have to do because
they're there to supervise and
to look over the floor and not to
take care of their own
patients.
Staffing shortages puts
patients and staff
at risk and
that's not what should be happening at
SR MC.
In addition to the problems,
um you've heard with having
travel nurses
who comprise a lot of
our staff, we have
nurses who are willing to
take on over overtime
shifts, take
on extra shifts up to
one or two
shifts
um a
week and that's
great. However,
it shouldn't be a
requirement. It
almost feels like a
requirement.
Um We shouldn't have to
feel pressure to take on
extra shifts just to make
up just to make
sure our our team is
supported on every
shift and to make
matters worse, there aren't enough patient
care techs often
at night,
there's only one
tick
and that means it takes longer
for us to get to the
patients when they call for
help.
That means that our patients
rooms are may
not be picked up or,
or straightened out.
Um, and
the patients notice that we're pressed
for time and
that's not good.
We often don't have an ultrasound
tech on weekends.
That means that if a patient
needs an ultrasound
on a Friday, they
may stay in that
hospital for no
other reason than waiting
for a
simple
scan.
One more concern that I want
to discuss briefly
and it's about speaking
up. If we have a
concern about patient safety
or quality, we need to feel safe
going to the administration and
voicing our concerns without
being shut down,
ignored or actually
targeted at times.
We have a union but without a
contract, we are scared
to speak up for our patients.
We need the hospital to come to
the bargaining table
and to fight for the same thing we're
fighting for safe patient
care. Thank
you.
>> So their serious concerns
have been reinforced by national
organizations that rate
hospital overall quality.
For example,
leapfrog,
they leapfrog gave
Sandoval one of its lowest
ratings. A rating of
ad, the
only lower score
in the in the state
is un M Maine
Lous campus which received an
f
the National Centers for Medicare
and Medicare Services gave
Sandoval one star out of
five star for overall
patient quality.
And while another rating group
just looked at the social responsibility
measures and gave the hospital
a decent score. And this and the
hospital is doing
paid ads to lift
up this,
let me be clear that
rating has nothing to do
with patient safety or patient
care. So instead
of taking seriously the
miserable quality of care
and fixing the problems at
Sandoval, they have
chosen to spend their time and
money fighting the union,
which just wants to improve
patient care,
improve retention and
respect of the staff.
The hospital talks about having a
pipeline and I think I will
listen to your the testimony
here for the last few days,
we hear a lot about a
pipeline to
recruit nurses
into the hospital to get them into
the schools. But the
truth is that pipeline
is broken. You
can pack it as full as you
want. It's still
leaking. One
nurse was recruited from nursing
school and elsewhere
and they're so turned off by our
by the conditions that they
quit, six were hired
into the emergency department and
in six months, five of them
left
nationally, new
nurses are leaving the
profession within two
years of getting their
degree.
So our patient
care concerns have far-reaching
consequences.
Patients are being denied timely
care, efficient
care. For example,
patients wait an average of
five hours to get care at the
emergency department. At
Sandoval Regional.
The state average
is about half that
and the national average is about
a third of
that.
The hospital can't recruit or
keep staff because of staffing
shortages and other deficiencies.
Workers fear for the safety
of their patients and
themselves and their
la their licenses which
they covet that bring income
into their families.
Currently, they're not able
to give the kind of care that they
can always be proud of.
Workers are scared to raise
concerns for fear
of retaliation, intimidation
and termina termination which
you have heard about today.
The public hospital is wasting
tax dollars with petty
litigation, petty
litigation for stalling
bargaining and money
that should be used for
patient care.
They've used at least as by
our calculation over
$700,000
paying Verde law firm over
the last three years.
And Sandoval Regional is ignoring
the authority of this legislative
body which
confirmed that we
are public employees and we have a
right to unionize under the
Public Employees Bargaining
Act and
you will recall a lot of you worked
on that under on P
A and it is a very important
act to public employees and they're denying
us a right.
The hospital is a legal obligation
to meet the union at the bargaining
table to negotiate to
a contract that prioritizes
safe patient care, recruitment
and retention of quality new
Mexican health care
professionals.
So we can meet the community's
expectation of
quality and safe care.
As we speak,
this hospital is illegally
defying an order by
the public employee board relations
to bargain and has
ignored the ruling of
district Judge Joshua
Allison in which he denied
all grounds the hospital's
emergency motion to stay
previous bargaining
orders.
We just want to meet at the bargaining
table so we can deliver the care that
Sandoval patients deserve
and expect. It's laughable
that they claim that there's shared
governance. I think you've heard that
term thrown around here
in the last few days.
Um With
they have hand picked
workers. If you have a
union, then the union
lets the union members
pick who goes into shared
governance and who
will have the voice at the table.
And then that's a fair
reasonable voice to have at the
table.
So that can only happen
when the right people are at the
table. We have
another important as we
would ask also
that this next legislative
session that the
legislature would set safe
staffing ratios
so that nurses and other health care
professionals would have
reasonable and safe patient
loads patients
would get timely care,
they would not be rushed.
The readmission rate at
Sandoval, they're in the top
40 in top 40
hospitals in the nation
for readmissions.
And that means that
there is mistakes being made on the
way out the
door.
The patients should get timely
care, it shouldn't be rushed.
They should be allowed to understand
what we're saying to them
and go home
safely and stay
home.
So we would be glad to take
questions and
hear, um hear
from you
>> uh committee members
at, at our last meeting.
Um The committee
voted to prepare a
letter. I
think uh
Xander is just
emailed you the,
the current
draft of that letter
we haven't sent it out. Uh
We won't until Representative
Thompson checks
it over. But I, I'd urge you
to check out the letter
and give some feedback before
we send it out my
recollection of the letter. I don't
have it right in front of me, but
uh Sander can correct me
is that we urge U and
M uh and the
Board of Regents
to enter into
negotiations with the union.
Basically, that's what we're
surging.
Um And
this, this
is the current
draft,
the, the Legislative
Health and Social Services
Committee. It's
two
Kathleen Becker,
uh Jamie
Silva Steele
and Doug Zidan.
Oh, and Doctor Finn,
the dean of the medical
school. Uh The
Legislative Health and Human Services
Committee is writing to express
our support
for fair
compensation
and treatment of
the health care workers at
Sandoval Regional Medical
Center. We're
concerned about the current
staffing
situation
at Sr Mc.
We understand there has been a
high level of staff
turnover and
this seems to have led to
several
unfortunate
outcomes
including unreasonably
high wait
times.
Um This committee is
not interested in pointing
fingers or placing
blame. We are
aware of the highly
contentious labor
negotiations
at Sr MC. We urge
you to make every
reasonable effort to
negotiate and to
come to a fair deal
with the workers
that make Sr
MC function.
So that's the, the, the
draft we're, we're operating
with at this point. It hasn't been
sent yet until
Representative Thompson. Oks
it, I, I read it over.
I said it looked fine to
me. Uh
questions from the
committee.
>> Thank you. Thank
you, Mr Chair. I think it's,
it sounds like a good letter I
I would consider if you, if
you feel appropriate.
Um
adding something about
respect and listening
to the frontline people for
solutions to their staffing
problems because that came
through in the, in
the,
in the presentations we heard
is a lack of respect and a
lack of, I mean,
yes, negotiating is one thing
but they're not, they're
also
the allegation that
they're not listening to them on
patient safety issues
and creating safe spaces
where people have concerns.
Um And
so,
I mean, I'm happy to, to work on
the line, but something like we urge
you to respect
the value
of the work and respect
the perspectives
of these important
individuals who do these
services, something like that.
Um I,
I would just suggest adding
that
because I, I certainly felt
that come through
>> Representative
Charles
>> Mr Chair. I don't have any questions
about the letter. I think the letter is
fine.
Oops,
sorry.
Um I think the letter is fine
and I wouldn't have a problem with the
additions that Senators
Lopez is um,
is suggesting. Um, but
I do have some questions about
negotiations. Is the
hospital not, has the hospital
not bargained at all.
>> They have offered for
us to conditionally
bargain, which as you are
aware, would be illegal
for us to enter into that. We
tried to
meet with them briefly.
Um And then they tried to put
more conditions on the bargaining.
And so, you know, we obviously
cannot do conditional
bargaining. >> So my
question is, have you met in any
sessions at all to do
any negotiation? >> We did meet
that one time and talk to
them and then they added
more conditions and we said we
were sorry, we just couldn't do conditional
bargaining. So >> you haven't,
when did you start
bargaining? >> Um That was
in February was the one time
we met and then
they have not gone
since they've instead filed
more lawsuits in
district court.
>> And the most recent lawsuit was
the one that's noted
in this handout
that >> there was another
filed one since then.
But Judge Allison
is the last place that we have
appeared before a
judge, we had a status
report and he indicated
and he's actually sent,
denied their
request for
stays. And
so they, at this point
are under a legal obligation to
negotiate a full contract.
>> So you don't have any bargaining date
scheduled, >> correct,
ma'am. >> And so
my other question is so you
haven't, have you
offered them a proposal,
any proposals at all?
>> The one day that we
met, we gave
them a full contract that we
had completely
written. >> So there
aren't any t >> a s not
one, no, mam. >> All
right.
And can you sort of
summarize the rationale
for the hospital refusing to
bargain? Because I,
if I'm
correct, I know that
I understand that they've
reached an agreement with the
Machinists Union at Sandoval.
>> Correct. For us. They
do not want to include
Pr N or what
we call when necessary employees,
which would be similar to
adjunct. And some of
you might remember the battle
between UN M and
A FT over adjunct
professors. We have
a similar uh
subset of
staff called PR N who
come and work intermittently
for us and they don't want
to include them.
And so they
have, they said they are willing
to take that all
the way to
the Supreme Court if
necessary. And
we will not exclude the Pr
N workers. Um Just
like we wouldn't exclude the adjunct
workers. A lot of the
pr N workers work full
time at Sandoval
and other places.
Um And so we,
we just can't leave them
out.
>> Yeah, I mean,
Mr Chair, I, I think that's
a difficult argument.
P RN Ss aren't included
in the UN MH contract
either.
>> So they are,
they are across the country in
our other contracts.
>> They may be in the
private sector though. But other than
that, what are the other
reason that they don't want to come to the
table?
>> They really haven't said any.
They've said
the goal,
the goal line has moved.
It has been, they didn't
believe that
they had to only do cards.
They thought we should be under the
NLRB.
We fixed that.
They said they didn't like the
way that the director
counted the cards.
And so they filed a case
about that.
They have said the PR N
employees, which is
another
reason.
So the goal line has moved
frequently with them. I think
that is we're down to kind
of that issue is the PR N
employees. >> So
right now, the only sticking issue
is the P RNS >> as
far as I know
that and
they don't want to allow some
of our reps onto
campus. They won't
give us access to employees. They
won't from our point of
view. They aren't giving us access
and they
like this rep, this rep can
come. They don't like these reps,
they can't
come.
>> Ok. Thank you, Mr
Chen.
>> Anybody else?
Um
Senator
Tillman,
>> thank you, Mr Chair and thank
you
for being here for your
presentation.
So
sorry to hear that
you're
having
problems.
So this sheet
here says
uh only one other hospital
in New Mexico earned a lower
rating. The University
of New Mexico
received an f is that the,
the main hospital
on the lous? It's
got a >> chair
and Senator Toman.
Yes, sir. That would be
the main hospital UN
M main
lous. >> That's
pretty, that's pretty dis
disconcerting.
I had no idea it was that
poor.
>> Yes, sir.
>> So anybody
getting excited about that other
than you,
>> it doesn't appear to be,
sir. It doesn't appear to be,
sir. And we've raised
this concern
to the
regents and we've raised
it in the press. You'll see press
releases and press information
in your packets.
And we
have,
um, we have
gotten nowhere
and, and Ceo
Becker did a
news
interview
with one of the Albuquerque
news outlets and
said that she was shocked that the
rating was this low
and that she was very
sad and concerned for the people
of New Mexico. I may be
paraphrasing but it was something
like that. So,
>> yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm curious
to and surprised
that this hasn't received more
publicity.
>> This is old news.
This was back in the
fall. I think that
I'm a news
junkie.
>> I missed it.
>> It hasn't gotten better,
sir.
>> The hi went down
too. I know
what >> went
down,
you know.
II, I remember
that. I'm
old enough to remember
that.
Well, this is, uh, you know, I have
a lot of experience dealing with unions.
I was the city manager for
Weist for over 35 years,
mostly in the Midwest and,
uh northeast.
And,
um,
so I was on the, you know,
opposite side, but I was
very proud of my
relationship, uh,
with the unions and my city
councils always
thought that we did a good
job of negotiating,
um, contracts
and, you know, all the employees just
want to be listened to. They
want, they want respect. That's all
you, you don't have to give them everything
they want, they just want
to, to be respected and
listen to it. It's just not,
not,
uh, um,
difficult, it's not brain
surgery.
Um
And
I think, I think it's just
a thank you.
You know, you show me a place
where that's
well managed
and functioning well and I'll show
you a place that's probably got
good employee
relations.
So I can't
understand.
I think it's a power play. They just
don't want somebody
to tell them what to do.
Well, that's, that's
pretty ignorant to tell you the truth
because you're not gonna
have a good, you're not gonna have a
productive well
functioning workplace.
Um So who does this?
Uh
a woman that runs
the Sandoval who she report
to. >> Currently,
she reports to Ceo
Becker who has
said it that she supports
Jamie in the efforts so
far
and they report to the
regions
>> and the Becker reports
to
and what the
top
Zonis. >> No, I think Zonis
is a lateral.
He's over the medical group
and I think how that
hierarchy works. They all report to
the regents.
>> So II I don't
understand.
So there's what, three or four layers
before it gets to
Sanon.
>> Yes, many
layers. Yes.
>> Well, you know, the problem is
also with a woman, whoever
she reports to, should
be
apparently allowing her to
do this.
>> Yes, sir. We would agree,
I guess. Yeah.
Yeah.
>> Well, what, so what kind of
reasonings
did you, did you get
from her that
she won't meet with you?
>> Um,
they have filed many
lawsuits and as I mentioned,
the goalpost has moved
multiple times, um,
it's been over
how we filed who we
filed with, who
was included in the unit, who is
not included in the bargaining
unit. Um,
so it is moved multiple
occasions
and even with a district judge
signaling to them, you
know, we're denying
your stays, they
still have not come to the
table.
>> I was very disconcerting,
you know what
I can remember
growing up in the fifties and
sixties there, it was
30 35% of the
workforce was unionized,
but the conservatives done one
hell of a job
destroying unions.
And this is
just
one example
of, unfortunately,
this is happening all over
the country and it's
sad and it's
contributing to the decline
of our
country. Uh,
it's terrible
employers are
being treated,
you know, in Germany they have union
members around the border board
of directors of
corporations.
So, and they,
uh, I mean,
that's worlds apart from what
we're, we're doing here in the United
States. We're trying to destroy
unions.
It's, it's, it's just, it's
disheartening, shameful. It's
tragic
because it doesn't
lead
to, um,
a good situation, doesn't lead
to happy employees,
doesn't lead to well functioning
organizations.
And I don't know what the answer
is
but, uh I've
sympathized with
you and what you're trying to do
and,
um,
they can't use the
shortage as an
excuse
to not meet with you. You know,
they say, well, we can't, we don't have the
money.
Um,
you know, it's
unfortunately a lot of
these so-called non,
I've been Presbyterian. I've had a good
relation with Presbyterian. They
try to make the public think they're
a nonprofit organization or
don't believe
them.
Um, and,
and here we have the university which
is a public
organization
and, and they act like
they're,
they're, they're not interested
in providing
a, I, I don't
get it. I don't know what
the, there's,
there's
a,
I don't know. Do you
have any answers,
Jerry?
>> It's ok.
>> Yes, I'll be
glad to do you, can
we all sign it or just you gonna
sign
it?
>> No, the letter, if
once, once the vice
chairman has had a chance to review
it, uh, the
letter would be from the committee.
We don't, I think we
don't each sign it
individually
and >> co-chair sign
it. >> That's
fine. I'm just showing
you how
committed to the letter.
Good,
but that's all I have. Thank you for
being here. Sorry, you're having a
problem and
um
maybe we can
be of some
help. We can't make any
promises.
Thank you, Jerry. Thank you for
being here. Thank you, Chair >> and
>> Senator, >> we appreciate that.
Thank you, Senator Senator
Pope and
we have Senator Pope,
Senator Representative
Chavez and you want
to join to representative her,
you and
representative
and for a second
time Senators Lopez. So
Senator Pope, >> thank you,
Mr Chairman, I sense
an ed coming from Senator
Tallman. So, so
look out for that. I'm
sure you right one
up my
favorite senator. I,
this time I sometimes
call him Senator
Tallman unchained because
he has no fear,
not like he ever did. Um
Thank you all for being
here. Um
First off uh
to the person, I, I
apologize for not remember her
name, what she's dealing
with.
Um I
hope that she
has taken
this up the chain and when I say
that I'm not questioning that she
hasn't. And what
I would ask is I know
folks from U and M are in the room
and are listening.
We have to fix this.
People should be being
treated better than that.
And so I
ask that U and M
folks look into this
and look what this person went
through
and
the person who did
this and
up the chain. If folks didn't do
anything, folks need to be held
accountable, we have to treat
people better. So
I would ask that folks at UN
M really look into this.
Um When it comes to
what you're trying to do
here,
um I get frustrated
myself when I see
folks trying
to unionize and
it's like this big fight
against it and
it's spending money
against it when actually some of that
money probably could have been used
in the negotiation.
So
I guess I just want to put out
to you and minar,
you know, our state
agencies like
just come to the table and stop
this fight. It's just,
it's a waste of time
unless that's part of what
we're talking about when we talk about
respect.
Um just come
to the table and
let's just
listen to folks,
you know, at the end of the day, I think folks
are always scared of unions,
but we can't be
scared of people. At the end of
the day,
the institutions, organizations
that get unions.
And I don't say this in a negative
way. This is not retribution.
This is not
union is a pen,
having a union organization is
a penalty. And so when I say this, I'm
not saying that at all,
but
those that get a union
deserve a union because
they have not done the right things. They
have not
allowed for the people
in the organization to have a
voice and to come to
the table. If that's
happening, you guys probably wouldn't
even need to
unionize, right? You
wouldn't even have to have the fight.
And so I
think that's where it starts. It all
goes back to respect.
So, thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, Senator Representative
Chavez, followed by Representative
Herndon and Senators
Lopez. Thank >> you, Mr Chair.
I was actually gonna
say some of what
Senator Pope did in terms
of asking the UN M
folks who are here to take
back what you've heard
today
and let
you know,
Becker and
Jamie Syla
Steele and
definitely Zeda
Snow, the
regents, the trustees for both
hospitals about
the conversation here today. But the
other thing that I also wanted to add
is that UN M
as an institution spends
an incredible amount of
money fighting
organized labor.
They've done it with
some of the
unions that have organized
on the main
campus. And
I don't know if cir has
completed their negotiations.
Um I know that Un mh
negotiations have been delayed
until August.
And so I think that the
other piece that needs to
be said here today is that Un
M Un Mh
Sandoval regional, all
need to improve
the way that they approach
organizing labor.
And definitely there's
a lack of respect when they do
that. So I would appreciate
that the, again that the UN
M folk who are here
representing Un
M Un. Mh, take our
message back take what you've
heard here to date back
to, to those
folks. Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, Representative
uh representative
Herndon.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. I just
wanted a clarification.
So the University
Hospital on Lomas
is the hospital that
actually treats the
majority of the
um
of the people who
don't have a lot of
money, most of our lower
income. But as a letter of
F and then
I'm looking at us as a
legislature,
the level of concern
that would bring even beyond
this strongly
worded letter
because we, if
we look at this population
itself being almost
60% of Medicaid
in the, in the major hospital
that would be responsible for
treating low income
individuals gets a grade of
f like what
I'm, I'm just concerned about our
responsibility there
and, and the other,
the other aspect of it is a
state run hospital.
I mean, why, why
don't we have
a, a stronger say?
So in terms
of what's happening with respect
to the people,
help me to understand
that?
>> Well, I mean, we do,
we, we, we, we
find, we provide a great
deal of the financial support
for the hospital. And
the Medicaid program provides
a lot. Not all,
they, they certainly have federal money
and they, they also take
commercial insurance.
There was some,
I'm trying to think back to
the, to
the, um, the stories
that came out at the time that that grade
came out which I believe
uh was in
the fall that
the, that that score came out
last fall about nine months
ago. And at that
time, the governor
was a, was very
embarrassed by it and
there was a whole, I, I
mean, I think even last year in this
committee, we, we talked about
how could it be that
this
our, you know,
flagship hospital
in the state gets a f
and the explanation
as I remember it and I
stand corrected if I
miss it was
that the score was based
on things other
than
the quality of the
care, it was
based on some kind
of report
submitted to C
MS that
were, that were
not reflective of the
overall quality and
Nathan or Mike if
you have a different
recollection of
it. And so that they
were,
I remember MS
Becker on TV
saying we,
we, we've, we've cleared
that up. We, we don't think that's
the case anymore. Those
scores will be out again in another
couple of months. We'll see
if they're getting up again. I don't
know. Do you have
anything else to, to say
Mike or, or Nathan
about
that
>> response?
Oh,
oh,
discussed today.
Um and
imagine there
um
on top
proceeding, what
happened
so
that
take back the questions that were
raised
that
about all of those
issues
like bargaining
situation, but also
what the responses last
all.
>> OK. >> Thank you, Mr
Chair >> and, and we will be
meeting in Rio Rancho. This
committee will meet in Rio Rancho
in November,
October.
So that by
then, I
don't know when those scores come out,
maybe by then the new scores will
come out
and we
will,
we haven't decided which we,
we, we were talking about meeting
at
rear
rust of Sandoval
Regional or possibly
at CNM or UN M.
There's several possibilities.
We haven't decided we
could meet right
at Sandoval
Regional.
Yeah,
we'll, we'll, we'll find out
who invites. We'll find out who has
the best lunch
menu
and make our decision based
on hard
facts.
Anything else? Representative?
No, that's all Mr Chair. Thank
you,
Senator
Lopez. >> Thank you, Mr
Chair. I didn't think it was for a second
time because the first time I was just giving
input on the letter,
but I am really
concerned about hearing this.
I'm interested. Do you
happen to know how much money
you and has spent
on, on attorneys
and going to court and doing
this? >> So,
um they will not
release the records because up
until January, they were
considered a private research
organization and so they
will not release those records.
But by the calculation
of what we have spent
on you and
Valdez
defending ourselves
if we can almost
triple that because
the Rie law firm charges
so much more.
Um They
have spent at least
$700,000 as
a conservative guest,
but now they can use
University Council
so they can, you know, have
University Council represent
them because they have moved under the
UN M umbrella officially
as of January.
And so they have unlimited
legal resources
now
>> except University of New
Mexico uses state
funds which
we have oversight of
and also
our public.
Yes, ma'am. Um So
it's very disappointing
to hear this story. I'm real interested
in hearing what they have to say,
particularly a judge's
order that
orders you to the bar
to the table.
So that's just
very disturbing
and um
and disappointing, just
really disappointing to hear the
stories. And I'm sorry
that this, this
has happened
and I'm hoping that U and
M will take it to heart
and understand
that bargaining with you,
bargaining with the
union is going to result
in enhanced patient
care and happier
employers employees.
So
thank you so much for having the
courage to come.
And I don't know about
this strongly worded letter, whether
how much impact it
has, I think what would have more
impact is a
review and
oversight of the
finances involved
in this coupled with
these terrible
grades
um ad is, is
her herbal. I remember when
it, when it opened,
people were so excited about
the quality of care and
it was just an outstanding
place and to,
to see it go down like
this is is
disappointing.
Um Mr Chair. So
thank you. I support the strongly
worded letter and I hope it's even
more strongly worded,
particularly with this language
about being respectful because
Uem touts itself
as having respect.
Um And so they
should demonstrate that with
the with the unionized
employees. So
that, that's all Mr Chair. Thank
you. Unless anybody had anything
else to say, >> well, if I may,
I would just tack on to
what you're saying, the grades
UN M has said, well, that
happened during COVID
but loveless press and
every other hospital also
submitted their scores during
COVID and they did not
have the same failing
grades. Um
And so,
um you know, they do
have their perspective about why
they have their failing grades.
We think if they would come to the
table with their unions
and we have solutions,
we have staffing solutions, we have
retention solutions.
We'd like them to not focus
on punitive
uh measures.
They won't give Preceptor pay at
Sandoval Regional Adam
Crosby, the UN M the
manager we mentioned earlier
said
that they will not be doing it at this
time until we have a union
contract in place.
And you've heard about preceptor
pay while you've been here.
Um I've been eavesdropping
for the last couple of days about your,
your testimony. It's been
great. So, thank
you. Um
So yeah, I I think
there's a lot of problems there
and we would really
welcome more questions.
We would happily come up any
time and then we hope to see
you during the legislative
session to work on
some of the solutions that we
think would have a broader impact across
the state to
improve patient care
for the New Mexicans.
It would recruit and retain staff
within the state
and uh we would not
have nurses flying in
using Uber nursing
apps to try and
get to
a, a shift at a hospital
instead, we would have stable committed
staff who are part of the decision
making bodies at the
hospital. They would have
contracts in place that people
could be held accountable to and
transparency
and, and statewide
staffing rules that
would also be transparent
and they would be held accountable
to. >> Thank
you Mr Chair and, and
just saying that
is something that this committee can
do is shine light on the issue
and bring transparency
to, to the situation.
So thank you all for having the
courage to come. Thank you, Mr
Chair. That's all I
have.
>> Thank you, Senator. Anybody
else, thank
you for coming and,
and you know, making
the trek up here, taking the
time to do that.
Uh We,
we, we had already agreed
to send a letter
but uh hearing your
testimony, you know, gives
extra impetus to,
to getting that out.
Uh The vice chairman is
reviewing it now and, and she
and I will consult on getting that
out and,
um you know, the board, the
Board of Regents apparently already
said bargain
and, and they still aren't bargaining.
So for whatever it's
worth we
will, we will add our
voice to those urging them
to sit down with you and, and
work out something.
Uh >> We
thank the committee so much for your
time. We love, I love watching
the work you're doing. We really
appreciate it. And um I
thank these brave workers for
coming up here because
they have to go back and face their
managers now that they came up
here. So thank you very
much.
>> If we, if we
testimony over the last several
days says there's plenty of other places
to work too in case they
take retaliation.
There's no shortage of
openings for, for nurses
and social workers around the
state. Although it may not be as
convenient as you have
so that may
temper some of their determination
to retaliate. >> Thank you
so much. Have a great day,
everyone. Happy fourth
of July, everyone. Thank you so much. Thank
>> you. So members,
we go now to public
comment and
we have, I
think just one
person,
>> is it Robin
Chavez
is Robin Chavez
here.
She gave
up.
Then we have two
online
uh Nat Dean
and Tom
Scrips.
>> Doctor Risma is a
dentist.
>> Nat Dean is
our
ad hoc public
member of the
committee.
>> Yes.
Yeah.
Thank you, Nat uh
Doctor
Sfz.
Uh So, uh
Doctor Scrips, >> are
>> you, >> are you gonna be
introducing or asking
the legislature to consider that
>> compact?
>> Uh-huh, that
would be, that would be worth
the getting to our committee
uh before our
November
meeting,
>> not that we have a great
batting average on compacts,
but >> it
might help a little >> bit if we
have a chance >> to endorse
it.
That's >> great. And you can work with our
staff on
>> that.
>> Well, thank you very much for
that suggestion and members
>> with that, we, we
conclude our business. I will
mention that we, we have a
report
that um is
going to be distributed
to all of the committee
uh that was done on a study
that we uh
paid for with
leftover mon monies
from last year's
uh uh committee
studies research
projects. And
um Sam Howorth
did this one and
he took all of the earlier
work on
global budgeting for
for hospitals
and made some uh made
some analysis of those
recommendations
from those earlier
studies, consolidated
them and gave us
some additional
information that
will be circulated to
us. Um
I guess this
week we should be getting
it. So
read it over and then we'll
probably ask Sam to come to
a future meeting
and to answer questions
if you have any questions on
that.
Yeah. So take a take a
look at that and
with that, we will conclude
today's meeting. Our
next meeting is in Portalis
at the end of the
month.
Uh Lovely Downtown
Portalis, especially
lovely at the end of July.
I'm told
the the
uh hay fever
season, whatever.
I don't know what all goes on,
but we, we
will find out, but the
focus in that meeting will be on
social work.
Uh One
of the focuses that that's not the
exclusive one, but that'll be the
main focus because
Eastern has a new social work
program, they'll be able to
report on it. We're asking
Doctor Nelson from
Highlands, the Center for Social
Work Excellence to
report and we'll
hear other information from
Higher Ed about
what's going on.
So thank you all. Thank you
all for coming and have a great trip
back and have a great Fourth of
July. With that.
The meeting is adjourned.
