Deeply and
Provides funding recommendations
to the full council and Gwen Per
ornamented. Uh, director of the
LES C, uh, chairs that and she's
in the audience back here, so
And that's one of our chairs.
Uh, the other chair that, uh
The chairs, our administration

subcomittee and develop policies
and procedures for us as well.

director of the
Uh, State Board of Finance.
We also have Antonio Ortiz that

course, Amanda's representing
the task force.
We also have Charles Sallie from

And um Mariana Padilla, who
represents the governor's

working nine member, Uh,
council that
Uh uh, We work hard and we, uh,
provide this, uh
This, uh, assistance to our
school districts.
Our last meeting was June 12th.
And our next meeting is July
23rd.
And, uh, today also, uh,
accompanying me here is Iris
Omero, our newly appointed
executive director of the public
School Facilities Authority.
She's been on board about six
months. Now. She hit the ground
running and is still running.
Uh, so we've been extremely busy
and
Uh, well,
We'll go ahead with our
presentation, and I'll do the
first part and then, uh,
Um Mr Romero will do the the SE
hit.
Uh, we do have a
And, uh,
So, um, what we'd like to do.
First of all is give you an
overview of some of the recent
awards that we've been, uh,
providing, uh, to our districts.
Uh, both, uh, new awards and out
of cycle awards, which are, uh,
full construction awards.
Uh then, uh,
Mr Romero will take a look at
the, uh FY 25 outlook.
Uh, look looking at our, uh, New
Mexico condition index ring.
And also our capital funding
programs that are keeping, uh
the the full staff busy and, of
course, going over our new
calendar for the for the coming
year in terms of, uh,
application cycles and and and
the like.
So if you turn to a
Uh, our slide.
Um, this one
OK?
Slide three and you'll see just
a summary here of the
Uh, projects that we've, uh,
approved over the last year, the
last six months.
Uh, 41 Total awards in 22
districts, Uh, standards based
awards, which are the full
construction and replacement of
schools.
Uh, systems awards 25 of those,
And these are smaller, pro
projects that deal with air
conditioning or heating and
cooling or roofing. These are
smaller projects that, uh, don't
take as long as the as the
larger projects. We've also
funded two pre kindergarten
projects.
And three teacher housing awards
You can see on the bottom of the
page. Uh, these total these
projects total about 568 million
Uh uh, when they're complete
The next page Page four. You
have a listing of the standards
based awards.
Uh, you can see that These are
larger awards, 11 awards and 10
districts. We have a range here
from Albuquerque of Van Buren
Middle School at 64 Million
Total Project cost.
To, uh I'll go is in Bern Leo at
22 million.
So they to project costs of what
the council has done is awarded
Phase one.
Funding for these, which
includes the planning and design
of these projects, and you can
see those costs, Um, on the 2nd
and 3rd columns there. Uh, when
these projects are done with,
uh, design, planning and design,
they'll go into construction and
you can see the the out E. Uh
uh, implications of these
projects. Uh, where, uh, the
local match will be 100 and 78
million
And the state match will be 259
Million. So quite a bit of both
both local money and state money
going into these projects.
The next sheet is the systems
based awards.
And there's 25 of these as I
mentioned earlier. These are
smaller awards. They generally
go within one phase. Uh,
because, uh, they they're not
large, so we we go ahead and
fund the planning, design and
construction at the same time.
You can see that Albuquerque has
a majority of these this this
round.
Well, they have about 11
projects there.
Um
And, uh, there's about five or
six projects of these that
include demolition, which you
all made An eligible activity.
Uh, some time ago.
Um
And again, you can see the
The the phase one project. Uh,
these are all done in phase one.
Except for a few of these that
we have an out your effect on
our fund.
Go on to the next page.
And Pre-kindergarten awards. So,
uh,
We're we're always, uh
Trying to encourage these as as
we, uh, continue to serve more
pre-kindergarten kids in our
schools, and you can see Cuba
and Albuquerque.
Uh, were approved Phase one
awards, planning and design in
the outer. Uh, implications of
those are 14 million in local
match and 16 million in state
funding.
Um, we also, uh, are running our
our, uh,
Housing awards and a pilot
program. We've been working on
the regulations and in that for
quite some time, and we're we're
learning from it, so we're
having to go back and change
some of these, but, uh right
now central Cuba and House have
been awarded funding for teacher
houses.
I'm sorry.
And, uh, these are district wide
and you can see the cost of
these, Uh, total project about
3.6 million for these units. I
should mention that Central has
four units that they're working
on.
Uh, Cuba has two units.
And House has three units. The
list of projects that we've, uh
funded over the last, uh
Uh, six months or so, uh, the
next page on the map, you can
see the distribution of where
the these funds have gone and
you can see that there
They're quite spread out
throughout. We'll go on to the
out of cycle awards, and these
are the actual construction
awards for standards based
projects. Uh, these are projects
that generally have gone through
the planning and design. Uh and,
uh, even uh uh, In the past, we
have funded education. Uh,
specification studies as well.
And the first column beginning
with Hobbs and ending with Los
Lunas. These are projects that,
uh, we provided the, uh, design
funding.
Uh, the the final phase of the
design funding now.
Uh, the list of projects that
we, uh, ordered construction
funding to, uh, starting with
Mosca ending in cur also, and
you can see these are large
construction projects that are
now, uh, under currently under
construction, and we hope to
have those online here in the
next year or two.
On page 10.
Uh, some more. You know, UH,
systems based awards.
Uh, that came back for funding
and you can see that, Uh, there
are 19 of these, and, uh,
Uh, again.
A smaller type projects. Uh,
that will go.
And then finally, uh, another
Uh, set of out of cycle awards
again. Construction awards
Except for, uh, the new
Mexico's, uh,
The school for the blind and
visually impaired.
Uh, a state match for one of
their preschools.
In construction funding for
Gaston Deming.
And Gadsden again on
Some of their pre K awards.
So that concludes sort of the
listing of projects.
As I mentioned, they're spread
out throughout the state, and
this is just a flavor of what we
got this year. Of course, on an
annual basis and you'll be
hearing about the new
application cycle that we've
gone from there.
Task force and the PSCOC If you
don't
And we have a newly appointed
standby to answer any of your
questions. I need to see what's
gonna be happening in fiscal
year. 25. There's we're gonna
start that off by letting you
know that the council has
approved the release of the 15.
Um the goal of this was to align
the ranking or the release of
the ranking in the new fiscal
year. We wanna align everything
with the fiscal year, so that's
number one number two, is it? We
also wanted to align it with the
release of the application
process. So now, um today
applications the districts to
submit the request. Um, the fad
is updated year round, uh, via
construction donors, school
districts and currently the
statewide absent
Statewide average. Um, the
districts have access to the
facility data through the fad,
Uh, program and data year round.
If you go to the next slide,
we'll talk about the, uh,
programs that each of the
districts has.
Whatever meets their needs. As
you know, we have the standards
program. This is the new
replacement renovation or
addition of school facilities
when the ranking was approved
the, UM
The school facilities in the top
100 of the current the weighted
enemy.
We also have the systems be the
top 300 these again as um
Uh, Cherokee and said that the
this includes mechanical
electrical plumbing roofing HVAC
systems.
Also we have the pre K program.
Um, Fourthly, we have the teach
will be taking a look at what's
transpired over the past. Uh,
fiscal year, maybe two fiscal
years, and we're going to take
the steps. What data? Do we
have?
Also, uh, the requirements for
all capital funding programs are
the district local match
percentage is available at the
time of the award.
Current food. They must have a
current facility Master plan.
It must have a current
preventative maintenance plan.
In a district use of the
facility Information maintenance
system. They must be users of
that system.
Also recommended facilities
Maintenance assessment report or
the FMR with a score of 70.
And then there's the next thing
that we've done is again we've
aligned the application process.
Um, so with that being said, we
also have our PSCOC calendar A
as to when we will be meeting
with the PSCOC bringing other,
um, policy items to, uh, the
subcommittees so the PSCOC
meetings will be held once a
month.
Out of cycle awards will occur
at all meetings and all other
material.
What this allows is number one.
Not asking general contractors
to hold prices for longer than
40 or 60 days. We felt like
there was always a crunch time
to try and get these two, the
PSCOC once the contractors have
submit worried that we're going
to lose those bids and also
holding subcomittee and PSC
meetings on a shorter time
frame, or only out of cycle
projects will allow shovel ready
projects to move forward faster.
Also, the PSUC meetings will
potentially be more concise.
And the extended cycle every
other month for non out of cycle
material, allowing for
additional time to develop
materials for upcoming meetings.
Um so
Doing the analysis. We felt
again. We'll analyze again at
the end, and, uh, with that.
Said. I'll be sent for any
questions that you
Thank you. I see. Yeah, we also
have, uh, Gwen pra ornament and
Ashley Leach. Are they part or
we wanna do questions now or
they're just your OK. Very good.
Um, so from the committee
questions start stem.
Thank you very much, Mr.
Chairman, Um
Thank both of you for your
presentation.
I know that that several
challenges are before us. I want
to just go to two different
areas in my questions. The first
is on the Pre-kindergarten.
Work.
We've talked over the years, um
Jo. About what? What is the
involvement of E CE CD?
Their funding stream. Those
kinds of things is I read this
these materials.
We've restricted it only to
public schools and
Go for the visual hand. Uh,
visually impaired, right? Yes,
Uh is are the only ones that
we've we've done anything with
So that crosses one boundary,
which is we now are going to
Um
State Agency support
That serve education.
That being the case, I wonder if
you can future cast. What does
that mean for E CE CD?
Nonpublic school facilities
number one
But also public school
facilities.
As we push that program out, and
we increase the enrollments
We're putting more and more
pressure on our schools.
And on our community facilities
and I'm interested in
What our long term planning is
and how we broach that.
In In my view, Mr Chairman, the
availability of resource
Based on legislative action that
gave them
Some pots of money to
Effectively deal with the growth
in support of those kids.
And I think, uh, from a public
policy standpoint, as we
Contemplate how we deal with
Facilities needs.
So that creates in communities.
It's important for us to have
that dialogue.
Final point I'll make in many of
our smaller communities.
Because I try I go to every
district. So as I travel around
In Mexico. Often the public
school is the sole source.
For for those kinds of services
and that kind of care, so we
brought in
We loaded
R.
School districts more heavily
than non rurals.
In this particular regard and
therefore put on their requisite
that they bond themselves.
And things like that to deal
with a a state.
Agency and so
As as we move that direction.
I'm wondering, Have is there
legislation
The legislators in this
committee might need to think
about for future.
Policy.
As we deal with those cost
impact.
I know that's a long one
question.
But the real question is
Where are we in planning as we
and as it seems to be putting
more and more
Pressure on local districts in
particular.
To provide
Thank you for your question. Uh,
uh. German souls, Mr Rounds. Uh,
we are working quite closely
with
More recently over the last year
or two. It's one of the issues
that staff has indicated is
something that needs attention.
And we really need to, um
Touch base with them on a
regular basis. Uh, they have
attended several of our
meetings. They're working very
closely with the staff at our
director can, uh,
I'll give you an indication of
where we're at. We are working
very closely with
We find
We work.
And thank you for that. Now, if
you look at the visually
impaired
The 293,000 there. I'm assuming
that's on site, Ala. Go,
Mr Chairman. The reason I raise
that particular hear this, I
support
Those facilities and our
inclusion of that in this
process.
However, the initial mission
A public school capital like
council.
Was only public schools.
And
So these are state agencies, but
I'll call them our other public
schools.
That are involved, right? But
that's why raised the issue of E
CE CD.
Is an effect when he brought
that law on, we expanded
Our public school mission to a
pre K 12, but we didn't make it
public school.
We included private providers.
We included a whole plethora.
Of other providers.
My point I'm trying to make is
in rural New Mexico. There are
no private providers.
And so those that are left
holding the bag are your
district, so I'm hoping as we
work on our policy work as we
work in our funding work we
recognize number one the
importance of this but number
two. We look at all funding
sources.
Not just local bonding.
Not just local mill levies.
As a way of getting home because
that's a disproportionate share.
I think from policies issues
since it's a state
Governed.
Issue we need to think about
what does that look like? You
know, in our overall funding
strategy, how do we How do we
deal with that most
appropriately, most properly.
And, uh, we certainly certainly
support um
These these efforts. My second
question is about teacher
housing.
And I wanna thank uh Madam
Director you and and, uh, Joe,
you and the rest of the folks
for our work we've done over the
years.
On providing teacher housing.
Finding teachers in New Mexico
is a tough deal, right?
Upwards of 1000.
Of how do we accommodate that in
rural New Mexico in particular,
and I know it sound like a rural
guy, which I sort of am, But if
you know my history I started in
Des Moines, New Mexico, which is
about as R as you can get. And I
ended up in Las Cruces, which is
about as urban as you can get if
you don't come to Albuquerque,
So I understand all of that.
However, I see the pressure
points that are there as far as
far as the equities. We're
trying to trying to put in place
and teacher housing is one of
the ways we're able to attract
personnel.
In any situation, Uh, Larry
Chavez here in in Santa Fe
reminds me that the ability to
find housing for teachers in
Santa Fe is a tough guy.
And so this is a policy issue
again. My worry is that are we
putting ourselves in a box these
days because of our construction
fees as to what our solutions
are, and I'll just cut to the
chase for the committee.
It appears as I doing much more
work on Premanufactured housing.
Because of the cost issues are
involved in current housing, and
I was talking Madam G with you
and Joe before the meeting.
Would you mind sharing some of
the first square foot cost?
Um, but a big the big so again
as I mentioned before we
differently, What are the
industries they struggles.
So literally salient sales point
all shut up, and I'm gonna make
in this
Is we may need to start thinking
about our interagency work. We
need to do here's the bottom
line. When you build teacher
housing, you don't get to build
it on campuses in many cases
because our campus structure is
full.
So you have to go to adjacency
property or other properties.
When you do that you no longer
have the infrastructure leverage
that you have in your on your
campuses.
You had to extend that and that
has huge costs.
Uh, I think you were talking
about some units of puzzle. It
isn't in the duplex as I
understood. It's in. It's in all
the utilities you have to bring
to that site.
And the more rural you get, the
more
Uh, critical that becomes
And so I think that's something
I'd love to hear more about. As
we move through time. We need to
figure out how we get there. We
need to figure out how we use
other
Funding sources besides the
state of New Mexico.
I'm afraid we're going to run
out this chairman, though.
Mr Rounds. I'd like to add that
Uh, in the pilot program that
we've developed. We've
prioritized rural and Native
American areas for for the
housing as we as we learn the
process here and what how best
to approach the the problem, But
you're absolutely right. There
are many other
Uh, financial resources out
there.
Mister. The final point if I may
What we're doing on the on the
nations that are out there is
critical, critical work we need
to do.
We? We owe that to our Children
that are on various nations
there.
And And in doing this, though,
my worry is we may outrun
resource. We need to be more
Explicit and more planned.
About the myriad of dollars that
are available.
And and and focus those in my
costs.
We're in a great place as New
Mexico. We've got a lot of
money, right?
Uh, but somewhere in the out
years we won't so it's time for
us to
The divine if you will. What?
What We need to do. Thank you.
Thank you, Stan. Other questions
from the committee. A couple of
questions I had were very
similar to what What Stan was
talking about is what is the
cost per unit.
Of the
The teacher housing. Uh, we have
a couple of projects there. You
had indicated some are duplexes
or wares. Um, what are are those
ones that are running into this
problem, or these are are ones
beyond that that were running
into
Million dollars per unit type of
cost the the ones that we, uh
We've listed. We were able to
work out some kind of AAA
compromise with
The initial cost estimates that
we got on on the units, so we've
gone back and forth several
times to see what what the best
approach is, But, uh, you might,
uh
What you went through on what
each of these
Um, dividing out I was done some
very good. Um, and also
detailing that we did have a
district come to us.
Uh, unit, but those were cost of
infrastructure. Um, for more
detail. I'm gonna defer to Mr
Good morning, Mr Chair and
members. Yes. Um, so these first
three
Uh,
Awards that were made central in
Cuba. Each came in at about half
a million dollars a unit
Um, the the one when you say a
unit that's her levels her
living quarter. Yes, sir. OK,
not not for a duplex, but for
For one for one house. Yes, sir.
Um
I don't believe any of these are
actually duplexes. These are in
and so
Uh, the last one from house is
manufactured. It's significantly
cheaper because, um, as Mister
rounds pointed out
That is on school property.
There's already water sewer.
But there's already all the
infrastructure pas being set and
new houses being set down, so it
does come in significantly
cheaper when you don't
Thank you. I remember years ago
when I was on the board in Las
Cruces and we were building it
was just I joined just
afterwards but going out to
Organ Mountain High school was
very rural, and the district
picked up the initial cost of
running utilities and then kind
of recouped it as the area built
up. Is that the type of thing
that because the initial cost
that able to as others tie in
Or are these
Literally, Uh,
A cherry stem line that goes out
to nothing except for the tea.
Kind of along the same lines.
You had indicated that the House
one is already on school
property as we're looking at
doing
School buildings and others. Is
it possible to build into the
design some tits that go with
those so that it's not a
separate infrastructure.
Uh, Mr Chair. We do have some,
uh, of our standards based
projects that also include
teacher housing.
Um, as a policy. I believe
that's
It becomes very complex when you
do that, Um, you're building a
neighborhood, so it's not even
just streets, curbs, gutters, ID
driveways. So, uh, a lot of
that.
Is, um
We're not gonna get around, I
guess time my final comments
very similar to to Mr Rounds is
These are our kids, and even
though it's expensive, we've got
to make sure they have teachers,
and that means teachers have to
have places to live.
Um and we need to make sure we
continue to to fight for what's
right for our kids. And even
though it's expensive, and we
want to try and control costs,
we can't just say it's too much.
Uh, because it matters.
The other questions comments
about on this topic.
No, thank you.
You.
And Marin Toya, the 2024
legislative session update.
Welcome. Good morning, Mr Chair
members, uh, for this leisure to
update I'll be focusing on two
pieces of legislation that were
passed during the 2024
legislative session. That's
House Bill 27 and Senate Bill
76.
Uh, I'll provide a brief review
and then I'll talk about the
practical applications of each
of those bills.
So first off house Bill 207,
where HB 207 does. It requires
that the public school Capital
Alley Council, the PSCOC make an
annual distribution to the lease
assistance program.
Previously the
Previously disbursements for the
least assistance program were
optional and made at the
discretion of the PSCLC.
Although the discretion has been
discretionary or the
distribution has been
discretionary, PSLC has never
opted to forgo the annual
distribution.
The PSCOC will also continue the
role of setting the per MEM
multiplier and the lease
assistance formula.
Now
do, uh, in the real world, so
establishing a permanent and
reliable source of funding for
the lease assistance program may
enable charter schools to secure
more advantageous funding.
Um, there's two specific
examples of funding that these
schools can access. Uh, one is a
charter school facility
revolving fund. This was
established by HP 43 during the
2022 legislative session, and
the second item is a public
project revolving or also known
as the P PR F.
Both of these funds are
administered by the MES finance
Authority. Um MM FA is able to
offer low cost loans to
borrowers such as charter
schools due to its AAA bond
rating. The reason it has a AAA
bond rating is because they're
very prudent in making loans and
underwriting those loans. Uh,
the fact that the permanent
reliable source is there for
charter schools to repay loans
greatly reduce the risk for
lenders like NM FA.
Secondly, I'll move on to Senate
Bill 76.
Also passed during the 2024
session. What SP 76 did was make
a technical change to the Public
School Capital Alley Act.
That change was to clarify that
school districts eligibility for
a local match waiver is to be
based on the local match amount
calculated before a temporal
local match reduction, which was
established by C 131. We'll be
discussing S 131 a little bit
more in detail this afternoon
with LLC and L AC joint
presentation.
The implementation of the Senate
bill 131 could be, uh, result in
a temporary local match in the
range from 33 to 50% for some
school districts.
Evaluating the school's ability.
For a local match waiver after a
temporary local match reduction
could result in a district not
qualifying for a local match
waiver based on the three
criteria that PSECPSCC utilizes
in that process.
Now implications of SP 76.
Without the inflamation
implementation of SP. 76
addition could face a situation
where they, uh, would be
disqualified from a local match
reduction.
And this waiver could be
essential for the district's
ability to fund vital projects
and repair a playschool
facilities.
The temporary locum match
reduction instituted by SB 131.
will sun at the end of the
fiscal year 2026.
As mentioned LES, C and LLC and
appropriate state agencies will
continue to study the state and
local match formula and
recommend changes to better
reflect the district's actual
ability or to fill in
construction projects.
Uh, with that, Mr Chair members,
I will stand for the comments or
questions on these items.
Thank you, Mark. Uh, questions
from the committee.
Group today.
There's coffee in the back room.
Any questions
Stan, So help me understand The
collision between because it
sort of sounds like we have
between Senate 76. And then
we're gonna be briefed on 131.
And maybe we need to wait till
this afternoon.
But help me understand the deep
the disqualification portion of
it. I thought we had run that
gamut in
Amendments to 76. So sounds like
we did.
Mr Chair, Mr Rounds. So exactly
so 131 did provide a local match
reduction of temporary local
match reduction as mentioned,
uh, could be 33 to 50% for some
districts. But what's happening
is the waiver request was being
looked at after that kg has been
made. So it's making it look
like the The match is a little
bit lower and therefore just
qualifying them from the match
waiver, so that's it was kind of
conflicting.
So we're so what? I think I hear
you, Mr Chairman saying is that
PS FA?
Is likely to bring
Legislation to help us
Navigate.
That issue now it sounds like we
have two years, right because
prevailing is quite correct. Mr.
Chair, Mrs. Yes. So what? LFCLC
and PS FA and all other um
appropriate agencies will be
doing is looking at that say
local match and in doing that,
we think we can remedy both
these items.
Mr Chairman, just the public
policy issue. We need to
Navigate those waters. It's very
important that we not stymie.
Just abilities to move through.
Assistance.
That's the purpose behind all
those bills.
We? We were working on several
different sets of assumptions.
I'm glad that we passed one
session, but we need to do
Out there and put districts in
dread.
Because that isn't the
intentionality of the
Legislature right now.
And so I appreciate that. Thank
you.
No other questions.
Thank you very much. Mark.
Appreciate it. Thank you.
Well, folks, we are running well
ahead of of schedule. We're
supposed to have a lunch break
now.
You wanna continue rolling on
through things? Is that all
right with everybody?
Any any opposition to doing
that. Do we have the people that
we need? Um I can give them a
call.
OK?
Um yeah, and and kind of let
other people know we're running
ahead if we can, uh, LFC is the
next presentation is not here
yet, but they don't live far
away. Oh,
Are you ready for the present?
Are you ready to present?
Oh, wonderful If you're able to.
That would be great. Thanks,
Kelly. It's sunny. I don't see
as
OK, Would you like to to wait
for a few minutes and take a
short break? Would that be
helpful?
Mister chair. That would be
great, Just like five minutes.
Maybe Mark and I are actually
gonna do the presentation. But
sunny and Tim were gonna come up
as well. We're kind of
transitioning These staff
activities on both sides. So
I think it'd be good for them.
Let's take a five or 10 minute
break and we'll try and be start
back up about 11.
Great. Thank you.
Is
everybody.
People tend to and
That'd be good. OK, this one.
Then we'll take you.
We have
Yeah.
No.
Yeah, I see.
OK, well, it looks like they got
it going now. OK, I think all is
OK. Thank you.
No
Yes,
No,
sir. Not
5% of good. How are you?
As far as
They probably know each other.
This is not a great
Just let me turn the audios on
Already.
It's open to not now because
what it does is it pick up the
legs, So you're taking all these
nights and following them into
this,
Thank you,
Uh, yeah, it looks like
yeah,
Oh, somebody's makers on
OK, we'll We'll come back
together here. It looks like
we're ready and thank you very
much LFC people and staff and
all for for being flexible, very
much. Appreciate that. So take
us forward and I think the plan
is we'll do this. Then we'll
break for lunch.
And then pick up afterwards
provided we can get the rest of
the the people presenting and
kind of keep us a little bit
ahead of schedule. So, um, if
you will
I guess way.
Alright. Uh, thank you, Mr
Chair members. Um, Today we'll
be discussing the state and
local match formula. Uh, it will
be a joint presentation from the
Legislative Education Study
Committee myself Mark Motoya, as
well as Kelly Clark as well from
LFC. What list?
Um, what we'll be doing today is
doing a brief overview of the
history of the local match, and
then I'll pass it over to Kelly
to talk about some of the
current challenges will be
traditional school funding The
Zuni lawsuit Phase one Formula
Phase two Formula. Kelly or
Matt, uh, cover the temporary
match reduction picture
challenges, goals of the formula
and the policy considerations
and future research.
But with that, let's go ahead
and get started. Um traditional
school funding so prior to the
Zuni lawsuit and the
establishment of the PSCOC
school facility funding followed
a different methodology.
Traditionally, financing for
school facilities came from
issuing general obligation
bonds. Sorry, general obligation
bonds and receiving direct
appropriations from legislators.
Capital funding for schools was
significantly constrained by a
district's taxable land value
and their bonding capacity.
The system provided a
significant disadvantage for
property rich districts.
Fortunately, districts that were
unable to raise sufficient
property taxes and secure direct
appropriations struggle to find
necessary repairs or
replacements for their school
facilities.
I can't turn that.
Um, Zuni lawsuit. I'll do a
brief and very simplified
history of the Zuni lawsuit.
In 1998, the Zuni Public School
district took legal action
against the state of New Mexico.
The lawsuit argued that the
districts with extensive public
lands, or small, taxable bases,
couldn't raise enough funds for
basic school facilities while
other districts could afford
extravagant amenities. The
plaintiffs claimed that the
state system for funny school
facilities failed to provide a
uniform and sufficient education
for all students in New Mexico.
Later Gallop, McKinley schools
and civil county schools joined
the lawsuit as plaintiffs in
1999. The court ruled in favor
of the plaintiffs, ordering the
state to establish and implement
a uniform funding system for
capital improvements and for
correcting past inequities.
Phase one of the formula
In 20. I'm sorry. In 2003. The
legislatures enacted a state
local funding formula that
considers school districts
revenues primary based on a
relative property tax.
Wealth of her student.
In 2015.
It's good.
Convened a sub-committee to
study a funding from law and
hire the Bureau of Business and
Economic Research, otherwise
known as Bieber to conduct an
assessment.
Beaver concluded that the
formula did not make the most
effective use of state resources
and lacked predictability
necessary for long term
planning.
Bieber identified two potential
issues with the formula.
First property tax valuation may
not be accurate, may not
accurately reflect the school
district's ability to pay and
property valuations are subject
to significant fluctuations,
especially when Com commodities
like oil and gas extraction,
make up a large portion of that
valuation.
Second, the formula does not
consider differences in per
student facility, construction
and maintenance costs.
You want to slide six
intro Introduction of Phase two
Formula
in 2018 Senate Bill 30, based on
the Bieber assessment,
introduced the phase two formula
for calculating the state and
local match.
As a fiscal year 2023 the school
district, Loach should be
determined by the phase two
formula with a fiveyear
transition from the phase one
formula.
Starting in fiscal year 2019.
This transition period allowed
districts time to adjust to the
new, uh, formula.
The goal of the phase two
formula.
Was to better reflect the school
district's ability to pay.
And to consider differences in
per student facility,
Construction and maintenance
cost Now before you on slide,
seven
Is the current state and local
match calculation referred to as
the formula is the Phase two
formula.
As you can see, we calculated a
district's unadjusted local
match by dividing the assumed
cost to replace a facility by
the assumed annual revenue of a
district for capital.
Next. If applicable, we will
then apply reduction known as
the population density factor.
The criteria for how the rural
density factor is applied is
detailed in the subtext on that
slide.
World districts. 12 12% points
will be factored in.
Or semi rural district. 6%
points will be factored in.
And for urban districts, no
local match reduction.
The assumption is that rural
districts need more support.
Thus the result of the
calculation is the adjusted
local match or the portion that
the school district is expected
to pay toward a project. If you
know the state will cover a
maximum of a 94% of a project
under this calculation.
Moving on to slide eight.
With your permission. We'll dive
a little bit deeper into the
calculation and discuss how the
districts assumed revenue is
calculated. First, we take a
five year average of the
district's land valuation.
We then multiply this by 10 9
10,000, which is equal to 4.5
mils a year.
This is how we get to the
assumed district revenue or
school districts ability to pay.
There's an assumption baked in
here.
The assumption is that school
districts will take full
advantage advantage of SB nine
and partial advantage of HP 33.
Now if we move on to slide nine
Let's discuss the calculation
for determining the cost to
replace the school facility.
First we take the maximum
allowable gross square footage,
which is based on state
statewide adequacy standards.
Then we multiply that number by
the cost per square foot to
replace a school.
For those dealing with this
calculation, This number is very
susceptible to market
fluctuations.
After multiplying these two
numbers together, we get the
cost to replace all facilities.
We can then take the cost and
divide that by 45. The formula
assumes that it will take 45
that will pay for schools over a
45 year period. Rather
And voila! We end up with the
assumed annualized cost of a of
a facility replacement.
Um, before you on page Uh, 10. I
believe we have a
Brief example. Uh, Tim was so
kind to put this example
together in his last
presentation, but this is a
worldwide example of a school.
And the calculations and rid
numbers. So we look at Des
Moines, which was has 130
students.
Based on that average of
ventilation. We have 190.8
million
With an assumed annual revenue
of $171,000.
And a maxi maximum allowable
square footage based on adequacy
standards of 26,007 23.
Based on that, at a square
footage cost a 3.07 $307.47 We
come to $8.2 million
Annual cost. Replace that if we
analyze it is 182,000.
In the local match again is 94%.
Well, that's a real world look
at the calculation as its
density.
And with that, I'll pass it on
to miss Carwell to talk about
the temporary match reduction.
Thanks, Mark. Um Mr Chair
members of the task force. I'm
on slide 11 now.
Um, so before we get into some
of the current challenges, how
local matches actually being
determined now is the formula
that Mark just explained to you
plus and across the board
reduction in the local match,
um, implemented as a result of
Senate Bill 131, which you all
passed in the 2023 session.
So essentially the goal of
Senate Bill 131 was to shift
more of the cost burden from
local entities to the state. Um,
at the time to address
relatively low participation, um
in the fund and the council, so
essentially, it was intended to,
um, make funding through the
council for school projects.
more attack more attractive to
districts.
Um, and what it did was made
simple across the board
reductions in local match for
all districts statewide, and
those reductions were pretty
significant from one third to a
one half reduction in the local
match.
Um, also important to keep in
mind and we'll come back to this
at the end. Uh, these reductions
were temporary as Mark mentioned
earlier and they will go away.
Absent additional action from
the Legislature at the end of FY
26.
Another important point, which
will kind of unpack in a little
more detail. Um, is that center
Bill 131. The changes that
brought essentially did not
solve for any of the some sort
of fundamental problems with the
formula that the that we're
seeing now.
So if you'll turn now to slide,
12
Um, so the current formula
represents essentially a good
faith effort at trying to come
up with an equitable and
objective tool for determining
the state and local share of
school projects.
Um, but it was also created even
though it didn't happen that
long ago in a different world
than we're living in today, and
it's efficacy at the end of the
day depends on how good its
inputs are.
So how accurately the things
it's measuring and the
assumptions it's making about
those factors. Uh, real,
actually reflect the reality of
one what districts can afford to
pay, um to the actual space
requirements of a modern school
and also the cost of
constructing a school today and
currently on most of these
fronts, as you can sort of see
details on the slide, the
formula and its underlying
assumptions are
Not accurately representing
reality. We don't think
So if you'll turn turn now to
slide 13.
Um current and future challenges
we're seeing with the formula.
So the Central challenge we're
seeing at the council today with
the formula is that more and
more school districts are not
able to afford their local match
as determined by the formula.
So how did we get here? Um, as I
mentioned, the phase two formula
was created in a slightly
different world, in some cases
and quite a different world than
we're living in today. Um, it
was intended to address equity
issues related to the Zuni
lawsuit, but it had the
unintended consequence of
increasing the local match.
Uh, which SB 131 tried to
address
Um, the formula was created when
the fund had lower revenues, and
it placed more of the load on
the district.
Um, The formula also was created
when construction costs were
much, much more affordable. Um,
so local bonding capacity went
further towards the completion
of a school replacement project
than it does now.
Um
And then also, you know, just
some background. Um, on what can
challenge a local affordability.
Aside from just construction
costs, um some troubles some
districts do have trouble
affording their local match due
to lack of support from MI
levies. Um so sort of the
assumptions about what they can
raise at the local level are not
borne out. Um
Due to not passing bond issues.
Um, and some districts at this
point are unable to afford their
share, even if they are, uh,
imposing relatively high level
levies, um and bonding.
At a full capacity.
So if you'll turn to slide, 14
We talked a lot about
construction costs. Uh, in the
interim last year, so this slide
is just kind of trying to give
you a visual reminder of just
how drastically construction
costs have increased in the last
two years ish.
Um
And essentially, what we think
is happening is that district
bonding capacity or their
ability to bring local revenues?
Local funds to the table for
these projects is not going up
at the same pace that
construction costs are going up.
Um, I also wanted to make sure
Um, I pointed out that the local
match reductions that came with
SB 131 were you know, I would
say kind of well times for this,
but actually didn't anticipate
this big increase in
construction costs. Um, we
really started to see this
happening and happen
consistently. The spring after
this bill had passed, Um and
interestingly again, despite
those quite
You can't reductions. Um In many
cases, it has still not been
enough.
Um, to make districts able to
afford their share of the
projects.
Um all right, if you'll turn to
slide, 15. So how is this
manifesting at the public school
cap outlet council? Um, the big
ways that we're seeing an
increase in waiver requests or
what That means is essentially
requests from districts to lower
their local match.
Still further or even eliminate
it. Um, and this slide is
essentially just for context for
you to see the path by which
districts can currently qualify
for waivers before the council
And then if you move to the next
slide, slide, 16
You can see how much waiver is
granted by the council have
increased in the last two years.
Uh, both in the number of
waivers granted and in the money
that is essential.
Tied up in those waivers, and
you can see the the money the
amount of local match that the
council was waiving. And
instead, the state has is paying
for shot. Way, way, way way up
in FY 24.
So what is this telling us? Um,
this is basically giving us an
indication that the formula is
not working as intended. And
again. You know, this is some of
the kind of clearest evidence we
have that the formula may not
Uh, be reflecting reality as
much as we would want it to.
Um, you know, In other words,
the medicine that you subscribe
that you prescribe for the
patient does not appear to be
working. Um, and the patient may
need something different.
So if you'll turn to slide 17
that essentially presents the
question to you all of what do
you want to do about it?
Um again. There is a do nothing
option. Uh, the do nothing
Option means that starting an FY
27. We go back to the phase Two
formula and the effect that that
would have, um, is that the cost
burden would shift away from the
state and more to local school
districts. Um than is currently
happening now, uh, likely that
would have the effect of at
least preserving
If not increasing the
affordability problem that we're
having now, um, but that that is
one of the choices before you,
you know, just go back to the
intentions of Phase two and full
implementation.
Um
And then your other options are
you could revisit aspects of the
formula or the formula as a
whole. Um, and that's what we
hope to sort of get some
guidance from you on today and
start in terms of where you
would like staff work and
research, um, to go, at least in
sort of a big picture way at
this point.
And we wanted to frame that
discussion first, by sort of
thinking about what the goals of
a formula are or what a well
functioning state and local
match formula should do. Um, the
goals outlined on slide 17 are
essentially what FC and L LES C
staff came up with. So these
reflects kind of our thinking
about what a well functioning
match formula should do. Um, but
we would love and welcome
feedback from you all.
This is also what you think it
should do or if there's other
things we're missing. Um and
that, you know, we should
account for in terms of looking
at, um what? Any tweaks to the
formula, um, should produce.
So, um, just to kind of go
through these. What should it
do? Um, one? It should. It's
fundamental purpose is to
equitably and objectively
determine shared local and state
responsibility.
Um two. It should accurately
reflect district's ability to
pay.
So accurately reflect
educational programming needs of
schools today.
Should accurately reflect the
cost of construction and
If all of this stuff is working
the effect before the council
should be to minimize the need
for waivers. If the formula is
doing a good job of all of this
stuff, um, we we should not see
a lot of sort of exceptions
coming before the UM and F
finally slide 18. We wanted to
just kind of end with
Um, posing some big picture
policy considerations to you and
future research re future
research questions, Um, for
staff and again, um, as part of
the discussion, ask you all for
guidance on where you would like
staff work to go on this.
Um so first to, uh reiterate the
state, state and local match
formula and the waiver criteria
are inextricable inextricably
linked together.
Um, an increase in waivers as
we've seen over the last two
years indicate that the formula
may not be working as intended.
And SB 31, which is, um, going
some distance and easing the
cost burden on local districts
is only temporary, um, and
offers some relief. While the
state studies the formula.
And then finally on this slide,
or sort of what we see as the
big picture questions for future
research and kind of deep dives
into the formula. Um, the first
one is, how can the state and
local match
State and local match formula
More accurately reflects school
districts ability to pay to
contribute cost to contribute
local funds towards projects.
Um, to do the adequacy
standards, uh, reflects the
actual needs of schools today.
Um and three, when is it
appropriate? And perhaps when it
when is it not appropriate? Uh,
to waive districts local share
of projects.
Um, And with that, um, both Mark
and I are here for questions.
Um, also in both agencies, we
are have kind of recently been
in the process of
Transitioning staff work for the
council from Sunny and Tim to
the two of us, so they are here
to, um for questions and much
more historical knowledge than
Mark and I have, um, and are
available. Thanks, Mr Chair.
Thank you questions.
Representative Cha.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
Uh, you know, I don't know how
any formula would deal with a
doubling of the cost of
construction per square foot
like we saw recently.
And, uh,
Hopefully, that is just a
Anomaly. Hopefully, that's not
something that's gonna.
hopefully it's not gonna double
every year or so.
I think everybody needs some
skin in the game.
But I don't know.
How you deal with that, I. I
just couldn't
Any thoughts about that.
Um, Mr Chair, Representative
Sheffield? Yeah. So, yes, it is
hard to keep up with the sort of
dramatic and rapid of late, um,
at the same time. You know, the
formula should have some
mechanisms for adjusting its
assumptions about cost. Um and I
would say that's true kind of
Regardless, you know, I mean,
costs are always changing, even
if not as dramatically, um and
In the work to date that, um,
Sony, Tim and Bieber have done
on the formula. You know, they
kind of looked at different ways
of tweaking it and what the
result would be, and, um, they
can correct me if I'm wrong, But
I
I think this is accurate. Um,
even if all you did was go in
and adjust its assumptions about
the cost of constructing a
school, you would essentially
get the equivalent change in the
state and local match that SB
131 brought through its across
the board reductions. Um, you
know, so that's one option that
you all can look at is just
tweaking that, making it more
realistic and
Be even going forward. There's
some mechanism for kind of
revisiting that number, um on
some kind of regular basis, um,
so that there is a way of
Adjusting to the world as it
changes. Um, but Mr Chair that
sounds like a good plug that
number in
Real, the real number and the
Part of the get you part of the
Thank you, Representative. Uh,
Stan.
Thank you, representative Chad
field for getting inside my
head. There's some threshold
issues we really need to talk
about.
One of them is how important is
rural education?
Because you're doubling plus of
the number of districts is from
1 to 2.
And you win millions of dollars,
but it's two cases. It's not 89
cases.
And both of them are rural.
And both of them are because
they're local property value is
so low, not dissimilar to Zuni
with the original Zuni lawsuit.
There was a system like this
that I administered in the 19
eighties as public school
finance chief.
That took state dollars from
you, the Legislature to they,
the districts that was critical
capital outlay at the time, Mr
Chairman. You and I were talking
about that.
That worked then.
Because the thresholds were
different then.
And then we decided that there
was a dis equity that was
happening.
Especially among certain areas.
Zuni has no bonding capacity,
except for a power line that
runs through the reservation
period.
And so they couldn't generate
enough taxes to do a match to
build their schools. That's the
truth. That's the fact.
And that began the equity
discussion. I would purport.
That we have a similar issue
with the world education in New
Mexico. Hence my earlier
question about CD mandates the
local districts in rural New
Mexico because we're doubling
down at least their need for
facilities when you go from a
part time program to a full time
program.
It becomes a local capacity
question.
Here's the reality when you go
to Des Moines, New Mexico, where
I was superintendent in the 19
eighties.
You don't have the capacity that
you had when I was
superintendent of Hobbs, New
Mexico during the good days in
oil and gas, which they're
enjoying again.
And there's a difference of how
you do business.
And that's a policy question.
You legislators and we as a
state need to be as a first
threshold. How important
Is that
Are you going to build schools
once a school gets 80 years old
or more?
For those students to reside in
that rural area. And are you
gonna put a dis of the capacity
of local district is required to
put up in dollars?
Remember with me. There's a
constitutional limit.
As to what can be bonded against
6% of the total appraised or
assessed value of that district.
That's your maximum bonding
capacity. You can go to
Which in Des Moines, New Mexico,
might generate about $2 million
on a $51 million plant.
And so when you ask that local
district to put more into the
pot
It's a Disa request also, and
that's why we're in this waiver
because our formula doesn't
recognize the vast differences.
On per pupil assessed value in
the state.
So we have one or two choices.
Uh, Gso Chatfield, Mr Chairman.
Uh, folks.
Redesign a formula that goes to
a different factor.
Or deal with a wide diversity.
Or make a public policy decision
that rural education isn't
important in New Mexico, and as
long as I live, you'll never
hear me saluting that everyone
Because our world communities
are make up 80% of our total
land capacity.
Although about 20% of our total
students, and I will tell you as
a practitioner for 51 years that
a student in rural New Mexico is
just as important as a student
in Albuquerque, New Mexico, So
from a polish perspective, I
know where I'm at.
So how do we deal with that?
That's the problem. So now the
proposition is, folks, so it's
all your fault.
The cost of construction
tripled.
In a year.
However, you climb the hill to
Los Alamos.
And they at one point had the
project that was the highest per
square foot cost if I recall
when it emerged that I don't
remember what the name was $900,
a square foot vessel Alamos
Much less. Des Moines, New
Mexico, which has to build a new
one house.
Uh, I guess that representative
Chatfield, Mr. Chairman, over,
uh, over in your place. There.
We We had a need over there,
too.
And so that's really what's on
our plate, right?
We tried with formulas for years
and done a pretty good job.
Mr Chairman, in looking at what
are the what are the factors But
there will be as long as we're
going to support rural education
in my view.
A set of outliers. There will
always be and maybe one of the
things you have to do is figure
out. How do you pool enough
money while we have it?
To do with all of that risk of
the outliers for 30 years.
And put the money aside. We did
a good job last session, putting
a whole bunch of money aside.
If you build a facility in every
small district in New Mexico
over the next 30 years that
they're gonna fall off
I promise you, it doesn't exceed
one third of our state's
capacity of of un
On
Less than one third less than $1
billion.
Maybe those are some of the
things we might want to think
about. Since we're saving the
future, we have funds to do it.
Maybe it's the way we resolve
long term, maybe rural education
as an important
Because or or not if we decide
that's not OK. And you're
Because those kids are just as
important and I'll be happy to
help so this because that's
gonna be a wrong
Decision right that we would
take.
But Mr Chairman, maybe there's a
third a third effort. That's
what I'm simply saying. Maybe
there's a way of reserving some
of our
Substantial funds we're gonna
fill this year. What are they
projecting? Uh,
I don't know, anyway, a lot of
money.
That's
A lot of so Yeah, I have another
title turn. I can't use
literature. I was like a pile of
it if you will, but Miss
chairman, uh, as we as we look
at recompensing our needs for
the future.
I think it's time to invest and
you take away those shadows that
Worry rural education, right?
The district When I go to those
districts, you know what they
worry. They worry that they're
gonna be forced.
Consolidation and no longer
exist to serve them. And in my
51 year history and we can't go
there. That's not the right
policy decision. So how do we
adjust those equities? It's
almost a zone in round two.
OK, it's almost as any lawsuit
in Round two. It's the dis
equities are there. I wanna
thank you, Sonny. Tim. I wanna
thank you. I appreciate both of
you, and I appreciate the work
of PSCOC over the years.
Because you really have come to
grips with these
Highly differential things that
are happening.
And you've done it with
eloquence, and you've done it
with care. And you've done it
with support of what happens in
the district.
That's what we need to be about.
That's what we as an oversight
task force need to be assured.
Will occur by PS FA does great
work. Thank you for that.
And we just need my dad was a
Methodist preacher. The plate
will pass beginning at the back,
working its way forward until
we've paid for it. Thank you, Mr
Chairman.
Thank you, Mr Rounds,
Representative Baca.
Thank you, Mr Chairman. And
thank you for your presentation.
I'm gonna look at slide 14.
And, uh, what I would just a
real brief and again I wanna be
brief.
Um
Summary of
How what has happened in the
last couple of years, because if
we see from the very beginning
when this formula was
implemented, we saw a bunch of
consistencies, so I just want
That is for the question, but to
highlight what is the challenge
that is set before us.
Um, Mr Chair, Representative
Baca. I think, um
There's
Several different separate but
related challenges coming up in
the formula. Um, you know
One of them. Of course, that is
sort of affecting everything
else is just this huge spike in
construction costs. Um, that is
not, um
Things seem to have kind of
leveled out now, and we're not
seeing this.
Big bump anymore, but we're also
not seeing things come down. So
you know, this seems to be where
we're living for the foreseeable
future. Um and
You know, I mean it. It's one
kind of very obvious way that
the formula is not reflecting
what's actually going on out
there. Um, and then, you know, I
think the the question for you
all in this is sort of like
How, um
How much deeper do you want to
go? Um, beyond something like
this, You know, we brought up
that, um, the adequacy standards
are also a big question, you
know, are
Um
Is that something? You want us
to take a look at more deeply in
terms of how well they're
reflecting what a school is
today and how that affects the
outcomes. Um, of the formula,
the guide the work of the
council.
Um
Does that? Answer your question?
I could keep going, But I don't
know. Please. Thank you. Mr
Chairman, and I just really want
to be brief because I know that
when we looked at the SCG
funding formula this year that
that in itself caused shortfalls
among districts where having
districts that we're facing
reductions we are facing with
school closures. So my point Mr
Chairman to both of this is that
we may need to look at both of
those formulas of how we get
money to the state as far as to
cover the cost of of the
personnel.
Through the CG and through those
programs.
But also through the cost of
the, um PSCOC through the
through the Capitol, right
because
Uh, for districts, many of them
They have to pay for their match
through bonds.
And through, um, cash reserves.
And as this legislature, I know
that
One of the things we're gonna
study is I would be I would
caution my colleagues that we
want to look at claw back. Some
of those cash reserves because
that is some of these districts
are are saving that money for
their for their match. And so,
I. I really do think that a
study is going to be important
so that we can is is, uh, Mr
Rounds said. Look to see how we
need to adjust that so we can
provide
Some more equity and make sure
that all of our districts across
the state
Um, have adequate facilities. As
I said, before, when I sit in
this chair.
I represent all of New Mexico,
So I wanna make sure all of our
kids corner to corner
Have not only the adequate
classroom space but also other
space for CT and some of the
things that we have.
Basically, uh said, is important
part of our education system in
New Mexico. Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you, representative
representative of
Thank you, Mr Chair.
I guess my I'm going back to
slide 11.
And you see that, uh, things
things will go back, uh, to
where they were before that
year, 26.
Which tells me we're going into
a legislative session and which
will be, uh, for fiscal year 25
right now in January, so to
speak.
So
Is this the time that we should
start thinking about what we're
going to do in 26?
And now we're gonna have
something to look at.
Mr Chair, Remember, Uh, I? I
think there's a couple of things
that we have, Of course. The
bitter, uh, work to be done on
the state and local match, But I
think the fact that 131 is
sunsetting in this time period.
Uh, we discussed, maybe in the
meantime, until we do establish
a phase three or whatever you
wanna call it, Um, maybe
extending 131.
Um and Mr Chair, representative
Alcon if I could add one thing,
um, one of the intentions of
LFC, LES C and PSAPS FA staff in
starting this discussion now was
essentially to start early. Um
so that you know if you all want
to act in the 2026 session
before SB 131.
Sunsets that we will have had
ample time to put a lot of
thought into this and bring
options to you all to consider.
Um, rather than sort of trying
to rush something through, um
and only one
Um, you know, my my concern is
that, uh
The next session after the 25 is
a 30 Day session.
Uh,
And if we don't do anything
within the 60 Day session, it's
almost impossible to get
anything done in the 30 Day
session.
That's why I'm thinking that we
need to stay and start taking X.
And during the, uh
60 Day session that we will be
able to get this moving one way
or the other.
Mm. That's my thinking. I be
wrong. Um, no, Mr Chair,
Representative, Um, you know,
that's guidance that we all are
receptive and happy to take from
you all. So if if your guidance
to the three agencies is you
want something to act on in
2025, And here are our goals.
You know, we'll go back and work
on that for you and, um, bring
options to the task force before
the 2025 session.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr Chair.
I think it'll be up to
Committee to decide how we want
to go forward on this, because,
uh, like I say, I, I think, uh,
waiting until 26 is not gonna
Not gonna make it through the
books.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you Other questions from
other committee members.
I have a couple of questions
first, you know, and on page 10.
Help me understand the the
little box underneath that says
in fall of 2023. They approved
construction for 45,000 square
feet yet above it says maximum
square feet allowed through the
adequacy standards.
Why is it 30 or 40%? More than
what that requires
You know, how do we get to that,
as opposed to 8.2 Million, and
now it's 51 million.
Mr Chair. That's a great
question. I'm glad you brought
that up. So, um what? In
essence, this means is the
maximum square footage allowed
by the calculator.
Is the 26,000.
Um, you cannot design a school
that small. It's physically
impossible. So a cafeteria still
needs to be a certain size a
gymnasium.
And so what we've learned
especially in these, um these,
uh pre K 12 combination schools
is that 45,000 Square feet is
about as small as you can make
that bag.
Um, in essence, our calculator.
Uh, does not work for these
smaller populations. So these
micro districts, we've been
making a lot of exceptions,
doing a lot of studying on what
exactly needs to be in that
school, regardless of whether
it's 50 students, or, uh, 100
and 50 students.
Thank you that that helps a
whole lot of I was one of the
original task force members that
did the adequacy standards back
around 2000 or whatever, as we
were shifting to this model away
from where we were talking the
critical capital outlay model a
little bit of the history on
that. What we used to do was
Districts had to be bonded to
70% capacity, so they bond to
100%. Then it dropped down over
a couple of years in order to be
eligible for critical capital
outlay the Legislature then if
there was extra money at the end
of the year, would put money
into critical capital outlay,
And there was never enough. Uh
and so districts were always
fighting over it.
The and stand correct me. But
typically, what happened is
Albuquerque that had the
legislative clout with fund
schools through direct
appropriation, and we're only
bonded at 30% of
Capacity, and that's what led to
the big inequities. You know, as
illustrated, then from the Zuni
and and others that put us into
this system. Um and I think we
still have a couple of districts
that we just got rid of the
offsets that were set up when
they were getting direct
legislative appropriation
through it.
They bring all of that because
it may be time to redo a task
force made up of principles,
Superintendents, legislators and
others to look at those for the
very reason that you indicated
that when we initially did that
there was no guidance nationwide
on how you set up a A good
formula. We were inventing it.
Um, as we went with input from
principles of small districts
and big districts on what do you
need for a science classroom for
a a gymnasium or whatever. And
if that's the case, then these
kinds of numbers need to get
adjusted to make up for the
smaller districts, which might
solve some of the other problems
of why they can't ever fund
schools because, you know,
they're only being funded. You
know, in this case for 26,000
when in fact they need
45,000 square feet, and
therefore they always come up
woefully short, even though the
numbers indicate they ought to
be able to pay for some of that,
based on other things.
So that was kind of a long
roundabout.
On that, Um
On
Page 11.
When it talks about districts.
And
Ensuring that they have met
their SB nine and HBH. Yeah, HB
33.
I find myself asking at what
point when a local district
isn't supporting the local
schools through those does it
becomes the state's
responsibility to bail them out.
And is that a disincentive for
other districts to not try very
hard on passing SB nine and HB
33? Because the state's gonna
bail them out because we care
about the kids?
That semi rhetorical but
comments
You turn the a me on that, Um,
Mr Chair? Yeah. I mean, I think
you know that's a big and
complicated question.
Um
And you know, I think to
representative Chatfield earlier
point about, you know, wanting
to ensure, as we think about how
any or all of this might need to
change that. You know, there's a
careful balancing act like we
Well, it's a policy question,
really, but probably do want to
continue to find ways to
encourage local participation
and support for these projects.
And, um, you know, the certainly
the policy choice to date has
not been except in certain cases
to shift the burden entirely to
the state. Um, and the question
is, how do we do that?
effectively? Um, and you know
the council, in some cases, has
already had to grapple with
Well, what do you do when
It just doesn't work.
And might continue to have to do
that.
And thank you. Sorry I turned
the microphone towards you, But,
um, uh, Mr Chair, I. I will say
that in every discussion that we
have with each district we
Uh, we make sure to let them
know that the district is going
to have to have some skin in the
game. And that is, um, when we
do start discussing local local
Mac reductions or waivers
Um, there is, uh, the
requirement in place to be at a
certain mill.
Um, depending on which option
you qualify for, And so, um, I
think all but one district
passed bonds. Um last last go
around, which was amazing. And a
lot of that was the work that
our staff did and just having
these discussions with local
districts to, um, bring as much
money as you can to the table.
Um
And not just coming with $0.
Thank you And all of this is
also exacerbated by the high
turnover of superintendents and
leadership as far as following
through on building and, uh,
meeting no levy requirements and
and pushing those through and
working hard to convince the
local community that they
support of public schools
matters. Uh rather than just
relying on the state, um
There were some questions or or
concerns about waivers and
because we've seen an increase
in waivers that the formula
isn't working, how much
Or waivers due to a temporary
Unusual event. I mean, we saw
this huge spike right after
covid because there was so much
construction in all sectors, not
just public schools.
You have to have a waiver in
place because of an unusual
event.
Is that event unusual enough
that we need to con? We need to
change the process or did the
waivers cover that?
For a short period of time. Does
that make sense?
You always wanna have the
waivers available for an unusual
event, But you don't wanna be
reactionary that because there
was an unusual event, we have to
change everything.
Comments.
Uh, Mr Chair? Yes. So you are
correct that it was it was both.
It was, um, the an increase in
in funding that the state had
available.
Um and we were charged to try to
get that money out, Uh to more
districts, which which we have,
uh, but that was paired with the
unfortunate reality that the
construction costs
Uh, increased substantially at
the same exact time. And so, um,
for a district like Albuquerque,
Um, they went out for a bond
with the funding that they
thought would cover the amount
of projects that that they
wanted to get done in that time
frame, and it's covering about a
third of those projects. So
thankfully, um
The council and Task Force and
Legislature, Um, made it so the
A PS could come back.
Um because of those higher
costs, But it's it's a both end
situation. Mr Chair.
Um, Mr Chair if I could make
just a couple quick comments on
that.
Um so I think yes to your point
and then also, you know, the the
figure.
That is currently in the
formula. Little Over $300 a
square foot. Um, I think Ryan
will tell you like we're
probably never going to see that
number again. Um, so at some
point, we do need to think
about, you know, trying to keep
up with
Um, how things are changing. Um,
you know, there's also kind of
maybe two separate things to
think about with waivers.
Um, So you know, among your
options are to look at maybe
some, you know, relatively small
tweaks to the formula combined
with
Um, a kind of reassessment of
the waiver criteria
so that you're at least putting
the council in a position where
they can still sort of grant
waivers. If they choose to do
so, but they have clear
circumstances under which they
are.
Supposed to even consider it.
Um, Currently there are also
some districts that are in an
affordability challenged
position and aren't qualifying
for waivers at all under the
current criteria, Um and so you
know it, it might not
necessarily be a bad thing that
the council is sometimes in the
position of granting waivers
like waivers might just be one
way that you address these
problems. Um, but probably we
also need to think about like.
The waiver criteria appropriate
currently.
Thank you and very much along
the lines that I was going to
make somewhat of a suggestion,
particularly when we as a state
are in a time of plenty. Um and
people are worried about whether
these are recurring, or non
recurring dollars is to maybe
put a pot of money to cover
waivers for unusual
circumstances. Now, along with
that.
On anything of this sort whether
we're talking about
Setting a minimum wage or
anything else. I think it's
always problematic when we put
in a dollar amount into the
formula because it's never going
to be accurate from the moment
it's put in and so some sort of
where it's tied to CP I or you
know something else so that it's
got an automatic escalator or
deescalated. And wouldn't that
be nice, but so that because
when you put a set dollar amount
in it never works into the
future. Um and so, yeah, I think
that's a problematic and how to
actually
In a proper escalator for
changes so that it more
accurately reflects actual cost
to to construct, I think would
be helpful in the long run, Uh,
rather than where we see cost
triple what the The formula
number indicates. They ought to
be, Um
If they want us to comment on
that. Otherwise I've got a
couple of points or questions.
Um, Mr Chair. I just wanted to
circle back to the adequacy
standards and the comments that
you've made, um, we we are
actively pursuing updating the
adequacy standards.
Uh, we were charged by the
council, um, two years ago to do
Um, the community discussions.
We held seven around the state,
um, in different regions, uh, as
well as one in in Albuquerque
with design professionals and
such
Um and
Uh, LFC and LES C are absolutely
correct. They do not reflect
current educational delivery. Um
and we we fully intend on, um
Providing some suggestions to
the council. We actually did a a
presentation last year to this
task force on what we heard and
what we wanted to, um
Implement or suggest to
implement if you will.
Um, And so there will be that
going on as well as, uh, a
complete redo of the adequacy
planning guide, which is the, um
Sister document to the adequacy
standards and that is really the
roadmap to build.
Uh uh, K 12 school in New
Mexico and that needs yes. And
thank you and, uh, as a
represent, Baca indicated we've
had a big push towards CTE and
CTE spaces, which require more
space per student and higher
cost for equipment. And, uh,
Facility and systems and things
than just a classroom with desks
in it. Um, And so those
certainly are are new, Um
I like the idea that we actually
over the short break were
talking about
Having legislation ready, clear
down to the wording to come out
of this committee by the end of
our last meeting, so that we're
not trying to do it during the
session, but that it has been
vetted by this group ahead of
time. And so I would very much
like to encourage you, you know,
to move forward with all of
that on what are the potential
solutions to these dilemmas?
whether that's extending 131 and
make it more permanent? Um
Establishing more on all of
these. Yeah, we sort of
You know the simplistic view we
can either put more money into
the total formula.
Or if the money is gonna stay
the same. It's got to get real
located, which means some are
going to get a a larger local
match requirement to give others
a smaller local match
requirement. Or we can keep it
the same and have an extra pot
to backfill those who are upside
down when they try and make the
local match. Uh but I think very
much we need to be acting now as
an interim committee so that we
have legislation ready to go
carried by members of this
committee that's introduced on
day.
The legislative session, so
there's no chance it's going to
get stuck in the end of the line
when we get to the end, and it's
been fully vetted by the non
legislative members, the
superintendents, everybody's had
a chance to weigh in. Well
before we get to session when
the world can go crazy, and
we're gonna have lots of new
members, then also that trying
to help them understand a new
piece of legislation. I, I think
would be difficult, so kind of
my comments on things is, I
think absolutely.
This ought to be one of the main
pieces that comes out of this
interim with this committee is,
you know, having any tweaks to
the formula to the adequacy
standards and other things ready
to go on paper and not wait
until the legislative session
starts.
Chapter.
Thank you, Mr Chair for letting
me have a second. Mike. This is
a little bit off of
Spin off of your question of
increasing the total pie.
Uh,
You know what I said on this
committee, I said on the LFC on
the New Mexico Finance
Authority.
Capital outlay is to me like
this.
Like Santa Claus.
We? We don't really know.
How much we have or or where.
You know how it's gonna be
divided.
I So my
Request or question is, Do you
have something available?
Uh, Mr Kelly, that is a graph or
something that shows
Where this money is derived
from. Where is it? How How does
it get here?
And how is it divided? I know
you know, because on the various
different committees, we you
know, we have
Governor's cap out, uh
Did it. Capital outlay. We have
The representatives capital
outlay.
Public school capital outlay.
And have a little bit of an idea
of who does the dividing
But if it would be really nice
to just see it in a graph or
something, Um, Mr Chair,
Representative, Chatfield? Uh,
yeah, we can bring some kind of
like projections for the funds.
Um, Miss Leach could probably
speak a little bit more towards
what they're expecting for the
trends over the next couple of
years. Um, you know, just as a
reminder, the public school
Capital outlay fund is, um,
populated with funds from
severance tax bonds, so they're
very closely tied to oil and
gas.
And, uh, the nature of that is
unpredictable. Of course. Um,
but you know, the revenues have
been very significant. There is
a very healthy balance in the
fund right now. And I think, um
Ashley can confirm you know,
Expected good inflows going
forward. Um, the
The revenue to the fund also is
not like a subjective decision
made by the Legislature every
year as part of the overall
capital package. It essentially
kind of comes off the top of
severance tax capacity before
you all get the number of what's
available for legislative
appropriation every year.
Um, but again, we can bring you
good numbers. Next time we come
to you so
Mr Chair.
I. I think the numbers is not my
interest, the the process.
Is what I would like to
understand.
Yes. Go ahead, Stan.
Uh, Miss Chairman. Let me ask
this question, I. I appreciate
the way the way question
But also the imminence of 131.
And I'm wondering, Mr Chairman,
you raised the issue of new
legislation. Legislators come in
on this 60 Day session. I'm just
wondering if we might wanna use
a scheme that would allow us a
four year period rather than it
means.
Taking a sunset out of place and
pushing it out. It seems to me
that we have capacity, right and
we might be well invested in
And taking a two part approach
and really getting
Things formalized. Um, my worry
is this when they go to
committees with new legislators
on it?
It was gonna take time to even a
six in the first six day
session, enough time to
Push some of that out. So just a
thought.
And again we have the short term
right for the For the way we're
causing things like that. So
that might be just something.
And you know, I. I could see.
Almost two things is have one
that just extends the sunset.
And the other that actually
fixes the problem. If we can get
the problem fixed, then it
supersedes the sunset, and it's
no longer needed but have both
of those available and ready to
go in case the one
Um
Dies down that we don't get
stuck in an emergency situation
as representative indicated
having a 30 Day session trying
to fix the world around the
formula.
Other questions from the
committee.
If not thank you and thank you
for a very good, robust
discussion about you know
something that's right at the
heart of what this committee
deals with, Um, we're going to
take a break for lunch.
Now. I think it's right about
noon, isn't it? Yeah, it's 12
o'clock, which means if you're
going someplace, it's gonna be
busy. Sorry. Um, but let's plan
on coming back.
OK and on the
The agenda. PS FA is gonna
present at 1115, and then we'll
skip down to the school
district. Perspectives and stuff
is for those people. So we're
running. It looks like about an
