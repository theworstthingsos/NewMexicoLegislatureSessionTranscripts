Thank
you.
All right,
folks
will bring us back
to item five.
So everything is behind tab
number five
in our books. So
Natasha,
please.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um
Good afternoon Members
of the Committee. My name is
Natasha Davalos and I
am your policy analyst.
And with me, um joining
me, I have
um San Felipe's uh
tribal education director,
Doctor Car Carla Moore,
and their assistant
education director, Quentin
Candelaria. Um
actually one of my classmates
from last year,
so happy to have him here.
Um Also I
have Santa Clara
um Director of Youth and
Learning Jeremy
Oink. So thank
you together, we are
hoping to explore the importance
of tribal education
sovereignty and
its impact on our
students.
So, Mr. Chair,
Members of the Committee, I will
start with my report, which
is titled um
Understanding Tribal Education
Sovereignty. And you can
find that report in your
binders behind tab
five. And then I
will go ahead and quee in
San Felipe and Santa Cla
Santa Clara.
So,
um I had the privilege to
travel New Mexico um
for the past few months to meet with
educational directors from
tribes um to
discuss what tribal education
sovereignty is and
pretty much unpack the concept
of tribal education sovereignty
specifically what it is
and why it is important.
Um So please bear with me,
I will jump around
in the report. So I wish
to start on page two,
which um is
uh the tribal education leaders
define tribal edu education
sovereignty.
Um So tribal education leaders
share that tribal education
sovereignty honors the
autonomy of indigenous
communities to shape their own
educational pathways.
It is their inherent right of
tribal nations to self-govern
self determine and control
the education of their citizens
and make decisions about education
policies, programs
and curriculum that align
with their cultural values and
priorities. It
involves tribes having control
over education funding
standards, language
instruction and culturally
relevant
teaching
by emphasizing um community
engagement, cultural
relevance and the integration
of of indigenous
languages values and
practices. Tribal
education sovereignty
distinguishes itself
from mainstream Western
education approaches
which often neglect the unique
needs and strengths of native
communities. So,
unpacking tribal education
sovereignty identified
four key themes
that can posi positively
impact all students
and that is um language
preservation init initiatives,
culturally responsive teaching,
community driven educational
initiatives and fostering
positive and trusting
relationships.
I also want to note tribal
education sovereignty is not just
limited to these four
themes identified. There
were also some
discussions regarding flexible
funding which can support tribes
in allowing them to adapt and respond
to the unique needs of their students and
communities I
will expand on that on
that here soon. So
on page one of the report,
it is noted that the Martinez and
Yazz consolidated lawsuit
also touches on the principles
of tribal education sovereignty
for um the court
findings. Um
it was highlighted the significant
benefits of a strong culturally
relevant curriculum for students
with respect for their cultural
and linguistic values.
New Mexico's Indian
Education Act and
Bilingual Multicultural
Education Act recognize
the value of multicultural
education mandating
culturally relevant learning
environments and
instructional materials through these
provisions that have not been
fully met.
Court findings noted
culturally responsive
pedagogy is not
well integrated and professional
development in this area is
limited and fragmented.
Ultimately, New Mexico's
education system does not
adequately meet the cultural
and linguistic needs of Native American
students.
Interviews with tribal education
leaders revealed that tribal education
sovereignty ensures
cultural relevant uh
education for all
students. They also
explored the historical context
of Indian education shared
current uh challenges
and discussed ongoing efforts
by indigenous communities to
reclaim and redefine their
educational
system.
As mentioned. Previously,
tribal education leaders
identify the need for
extensive support in
language preservation initiatives,
culturally responsive teaching,
community driven education
initiatives and fostering
positive trusting
relationships. I'll
briefly discuss how
these four themes are essential
for tribal communities.
On page five of the
report um
discusses one crucial
aspect of tribal education
sovereignty, which is the preservation
of language.
It empowers tribes to
exercise full autonomy
in designing and
delivering language education
programs, tailoring them to
their unique cultural,
linguistic and community
needs. There are several
significant reasons why tribal
tribes need language
preservation initiatives, for
instance, language
preservation and are
for revitalizing
and sustaining their cultural
heritage and identity.
Native American languages are
deeply connected to traditional
knowledge practices
and worldviews which make
language loss a critical
threat to cultural
Integrity.
Furthermore, language preservation
initiatives support cognitive
development and academic
success
research indicates that
grounding Children in their first
language aids in learning
other languages and enhances
critical thinking abilities
leading to better educational
outcomes.
Tribal education leaders also
emphasize the goal is to teach
languages within the community
setting, not just as a school
subject. We want to
have thoughtful
conversations with our native
languages, not just
learning um simple
colors or numbers.
So it's very important um
active use of indigenous
languages fosters a sense
of identity and belonging,
especially for youth.
Some tribal educational directors
uh directors shared
the challenges to language
preservation initiatives including
fluent speakers to teach their
language,
which is causing some tribal
communities to struggle with providing
multiple opportunities for
Members to participate
in language classes.
Some tribal education directors
advocate for immersion programs
to improve language retention,
which is inspired by the success
for the James Pueblo Immersion
program initiative.
However limited and
timely funding
resources and community
engagement pose
significant obstacles to
sustaining these
efforts.
On page six, we
discuss um culturally
responsive teaching.
A culturally responsive
education helps create an
inclusive and affirming uh
learning environment.
When students cultures are
valued and integrated
into the curriculum, they experience
a sense of belonging and
engagement, promoting better
academic outcomes by
connecting learning to students
lived experiences
prior knowledge and cultural
frames of reference, making
the content more meaningful
and relatable. Tribal
education leaders noted that culturally
relevant learning fosters
positive identity development
by affirming students, cultural
identities as assets
rather than deficits
leveraging the strengths
in students. Um
The the strengths that students
bring from their home and their
community.
Teachers who know uh knowledge
who are knowledgeable about indigenous
cultures can also enhance the
success of native youth in
educational settings, creating
a more equitable and empowering
educational
experience.
It was perfect for me to catch my
breath.
Um Tribal education leaders
expressed some of the challenges of
implementing a cultural
responsive education.
They have observed that many teacher
preparation programs lack of
focus on indigenous
education for culturally
responsive pedagogies,
which teachers May lack
the knowledge and skills
to effectively incorporate
students cultural backgrounds
into the curriculum and
instruction.
Additionally, there is a
shortage of
indigenous teachers who
share the cultural backgrounds
of their students. Tribal
education directors also note
culturally responsive education
that includes indigenous histories
and perspectives benefit
all students.
However, some tribes have
experienced resistance from some
schools and meaningful consultation
and collaboration within communities
is frequently lacking.
Some tribal education directors
noted State mandated
curriculum standards and
high stakes testing, create
pressure for teachers to
adhere to uh prescribed
curriculum, leaving
little flexibility to
adapt lessons to be
culturally
relevant.
I've also gone on
um on page nine,
you will see that I
also talked about fostering
positive and trusting
relationships, which I
feel is one of the
most powerful pieces in this
report. As
um we've learned that relationships
between tribal education departments
and schools vary
but fostering robust partnerships
with key stakeholders like
educational program directors,
superintendents, principals
and teachers is
essential for asserting tribal
education sovereignty.
Tribal education directors
highlighted the value of strong
relationships with the schools
which facilitate collaborative
initiatives such as after-school
programs that use school
facilities. Tribal
education directors also
acknowledge that partnerships
are mutually beneficial
as teacher schools
can lean on their tribal
communities for supplemental
support in areas like funding
for field trips and
curriculum
materials.
Relationship. Building
efforts include
regular meetings, professional
development opportunities
and the creation of
collaborative bodies
like the education collaborative,
which coordinates with local
schools, tribal
liaisons and schools.
Indian education directors
serve as crucial bridges between
schools and tribal communities.
Working to strengthen connections
and address challenges
despite sometimes facing
resistance on specific
issues.
And as for internal
partnerships, there's also
a significance
in having those
um partnerships with
tribes. Um If
you're a tribal education
director, you also want to have relationships
with your community, other
tribal communities.
Um for instance, like He
Pueblo emersion school and
Kit's Pueblo Carris Learning
Center became models for
successful initiatives
and revitalizing their language
and cultural education.
Many tribal communities
have
partnered,
excuse me, many
tribal communities have partnered with
both Pueblos to exchange
knowledge and implementation
efforts. Similarly,
tribal communities turn to
each other for guidance and support
on Indian education and
initiatives including navigating
complex educational
systems. And that also
includes the grant writing
process and
um on the federal
level as well.
Some tribal communities are faced
with challenges in fostering
positive and trusting
relationships. For
instance, some
schools are open to working with
tribes, but the degree of collaboration
frequently depends on individual
school leadership.
In some cases, there is a
collaborative relationship
where tribes have
input on curriculum
programs and decision-making,
coordinative students. However,
in other instances,
tribes have little control
or say in how their students are
educated.
Tribal education directors
sometimes feel their role is
undervalued and marginalized
within school districts often
feeling excluded from
education policy
decisions due to a lack of
government or
district support as
well as insufficient consultation
and partnership from State
agencies and school
districts.
Moreover, meaningful
input from tribes
and developing school policies
and curriculum is often lacking
specific obstacles include
the absence of meaningful tribal
consultation by State
education agencies,
conflicts between
school, public
public school systems and
tribal goals and
cultural practices and
inadequate representation
of native Americans in school
leaderships and teaching
positions. Leading to a
lack of transparency
and inclusivity
funding was also an
area of concern as
access to funding sources such
as Indian Education Fund gives
tribes more leverage to
create their own programs
and initiatives in partnership
with schools. However, a
lack of flexible
funding can be, can
limit the ability of tribes
to negotiate changes
within the standard school
system.
Positive relationships
develop when school staff make
effort to learn
about and incorporate
tribal histories, language
and cultural practices.
Conversely, a lack of cultural
awareness and resistance
to tribal input can strain
these relationships.
Tribes with well-developed
education plans and strate
strategies find it easier
to collaborate effectively
with schools.
On page 11 of the report,
tribal education leaders shared
valuable insights and best
practices on how State
local agencies and fellow
tribal education leaders can work
together to advance
tribal education sovereignty
and improve educational
outcomes for indigenous
students including
adequate and consistent funding.
Recognizing tribes as
equal partners
and engaging in meaningful
tribal consultation and
collaboration.
Internally, tribal education
leaders offered to share their
expertise to effectively
support students.
They said their students education
requires a clear vision that includes
steps from promoting long term
sustainability and capacity
building and retention
in sharing their experiences.
Tribal education leaders
also discuss the importance
of recognizing and
respecting the distinctiveness
of each sovereign nation.
While some com commonalities
May exist, they
stress that tribal communities should
not be approached through a comparative
lens but rather
understood and engaged with
in a way that honors their unique
cultural identities
and
experiences.
On page 13, we
offer some considerations that
May strengthen the concept of
tribal education sovereignty,
for instance, strengthening
or clarifying the requirements
for tribal consultation
and collaboration to
ensure informed decision making
empowers tribal nations
and strengthens trust and
partnerships.
Second, investing in
mediation supports for tribal
consultation can be
fundamental for facilitating
more effective tribal
consultations by
enhancing communication,
resolving conflicts
and ensuring cultural
awareness.
Continue investing in teacher
and school leader. Pipe and
school leadership pipeline
is also
um a
consideration by increasing
investments in developing
a pipeline of native
teachers and school leaders and is
essential for ensuring
representation, fostering
cultural relevance and
providing role models
for native students.
Further considerations
include providing more
flexible flexibility
and funding and technical
assistance to better address the
unique needs of various
educational programs and
initiatives,
funding directly to tribes
to support culturally responsive
community after school programs
and other educational
initiatives is
also um a
consideration. Tribes
have the best understanding of
their students are the most
suitable authorities to determine
the best approaches for creating
a more holistic and inclusive
educational system.
Local school districts could
consider adhering to
both the spirit and the letter of the
law. Regarding
consultation
and culturally and linguistic
responsive instruction
and re evaluating community
engagement efforts
in applying tribal education
sovereignty. The State of New
Mexico May see
great benefits in
education and
innovation and collaboration,
community empowerment and
stability, long term
sustainability,
economic benefits,
social and community
well-being. These
benefits go into
further detail on page
12. Thank
you, Mr. Chair and Members of
the Committee, I will now turn
it over to Doctor
Carla Moore and Mr. Quentin
Candelaria, followed by
Jeremy.
Oh,
sorry,
>> good afternoon Chair
and Committee Members. Thank you
for letting us be here. And
I would also like
to acknowledge
that today from San
Felipe, we do have our
Lieutenant Governor uh
Maurie Sandoval
here with us
also advocating for
the support and the importance
of education um
and tribal education
sovereignty because of
its importance.
We did uh provide
a handout and we just
want to talk about some of
the things that we are doing
in our community
and the great
things that we are able to
do through this. So
we work on language
preservation. In the past
two years,
we have had
um bilinguals
graduates as
part of our program
that went through as
well. We support
students all the way to
graduation
including higher
education. So our
education department sees
students not just
through K 12 but
early childhood and higher
education. We
work all the way
through. We
also offer after
school activities in
our education
center and library.
We do tutoring and
homework help. We
offer these services through
extended hours that are
after school in the
community for
students to
help them.
But it's more than just
traditional act like
academic activities that
we're able to offer.
We also have traditional
activities such as sewing
and moccasin making,
painting those
kind of intergenerational
activities that they
might not get in school.
They can come into our
community and we
offer those kind of lessons
to students
and the interaction with
elders and different
Members of the community who
might have a trade or a skill
with them.
Um
Other things that we
look at is extended
learning opportunities.
So we've had the
opportunity to take
students to Washington
DC as
part of the National Indian
Congre or National
Congress of American
Indians. We've
had students participate
in multiple different
programs in the last
year to travel to
Boston or to travel
with arts,
um, and
other activities that are
not just in our community,
opening up their
worldview
and really allowing them
to see different
aspects and gain
experiences that they might
not gain. That's
always in the classroom,
education is
outside of the classroom as
well as inside the classroom.
And I think that's so important.
Um I've been an educator
for 20 years. This is my
first year in tribal
education and moving
outside of a
school.
And I know that bringing
that academic part
of knowledge was so
important. But also
remembering that
holistic
piece of
education is
vital to
a sovereign nation.
Um We
also want to talk about what
could actually be
possible if we were
able to
have the funding and
flexibility.
So
we really believe that the
possibilities are
endless.
Um Currently,
this summer, once we were
able to partner
with our le A which took
about half of the
summer school Session
to agree on a
partnership,
we were able to help
eight additional students
finish and get their
diplomas. And we
did that through work that
we, their
hours were only 8 to
1 for summer school. And I
understand that teachers
are already on long
contracts. Again,
that's my background Right.
So I understand teachers are
tired at the end of the year
and they might not want to
stay until
later. But our library
was able to offer
services until
7 p.m. We
were able to offer
services on
Saturdays.
Right. And this kind
of thing helped those
students have more,
one on one help.
And so tonight,
actually they graduate,
eight more of our students
are gonna walk across that
stage because
of that additional help that
we were able to partner with
our LE A with.
We also work on attendance.
We know we have a huge
attendance problem
and we are working to
find those root causes.
Find out why the
disengagement. It's
even worse since
COVID
that finding
out what's wrong
and doing that. But a lot
of that can be done
better from our
team.
Um Working
on the reasons we are
able some
of my team member such
as Clinton, he
speaks Kris, he's from
the community. He
can understand some
of the things that maybe I don't
even understand
right being the director,
but it's also harder
having somebody from the
outside in
the le A maybe visiting
that that family is not going to
open up to.
So we are able to
have that better
communication
and find those root
causes and maybe
even the supports that they
need so that we do
get kids back in
school
again, we offer
extended hours.
A lot of this was
done through the
extended learning,
um, grant
that was offered two years
ago for rural and tribal
communities.
We wonder what's gonna happen
when that grant money isn't
there anymore? Right.
We have been able to
really extend
our services
and who's working for
us and who's working with
us through that
grant and
the, the money that came
with that. So
we asked what would be
possible if we knew
that kind of funding was
reliable
and going to be
consistent
and had the flexibility
that that money had,
which opened up.
It wasn't so strictly
based. It allowed us
to support
extended opportunities
like Washington DC,
extended hours in
the library
home, visiting with
help from the academic
support specialist,
even hiring
qualified candidates
to come and work in San
Felipe uh
is so important
and that's done
through proper funding
with flexibility.
So we really
do want to ask
you to support and
look at what would be
possible if
we had that kind of
flexible
spending available
and that ability
to really
long term plan
and not worry that,
ok, next year, we might
not get this or
next year, we might only have
half of what we're we have
now,
right?
>> I can.
But
>> uh
thank you, Doctor
Moore and good
afternoon
Chair Romero, as well as
Members of the Committee. Certainly
do appreciate the
opportunity to speak before you
all this afternoon.
Um You know, as far
as what Dr Moore shared, it's,
it's been quite an experience
to really get involved with the
community,
to have an
educational background
that does support the work
that we do currently,
the work that we hope to do in the
future as far
as getting our kids, not only
through head start and kindergarten,
but you know, actually
developing a plan for every
single one of them if
we can and if they want to,
that's the other part, right.
We have to be promoting
these things to our students from an
early age so that they
take it upon themselves to say,
I want to go back to school
because we can't hold them by the
hand and pull each of them to colledge.
That's not, that's not,
you know, part of our responsibility.
But what is part of our responsibility
is to come here and advocate on their
behalf
and to ensure that the funding
sources that we have available now
continue to be there in the
future.
In addition to that building on
those funding sources to allow
us for, to allow us to
have the autonomy that's
necessary in order
to continue building out the programs
that we have as an education
department, as tribal
education directors.
But what I wanted to share with you
all is that
I'm not only a product
of a public school system,
but I am also a product of a bie
school system. I went to
the San Felipe Public Elementary School
as a, as a child.
I transitioned from
bie to a
public school system
in eighth grade.
And I want to say that, you
know, the transition period
along experiencing
bie schools
and the quality of education
that they have there as
compared to a public school
system, it's night
and day And when
you have students that are transitioning
straight from eighth grade to high school
into a public school system that
arguably they're not ready
for. You know,
we have to
think critically and ask
ourselves what are we
and how are we doing
things to prepare these students
to take that next leap?
And if we're not actively supporting
them and providing sustainable
funding sources to again
provide them the resources, whether that's
tutoring extended learning
experiences, then
what are we doing?
And so, you know, with
that, um
Natasha did mention that
she is a classmate of
mine studying Native
American Studies at the University of New
Mexico. I am proud to say that
I have my master's
now. But
you know, for so many
of these other students, it's just
that, that support that
extra bit of push
that they
require
in order to feel
like they can do these
things. I'm not
going to say that they don't deserve to,
everyone deserves to be able
to pursue whatever
it is that they want to do in life,
whether that's being a mechanic or
whether that's being a doctor.
And for, I can say, for myself
and Doctor Moore here, we
take that responsibility with the
highest level that we can.
Because at the end of the
day,
it's our
students. It's my community,
our community that
we work to support every single
day. And if that means
driving the 2.5 hours up
here, you know, we'll continue
to do those things. If that means it's
taking students to DC
and barely getting a rest because
we have a meeting when we get back home,
we'll continue to do those things.
But it's also important
for us to think about the long term
effects. How are
we continuing to build
in the need for
staff and the
services that they
in turn will provide,
you know, guided by myself
and Dr Moore here. But,
you know, these
are the things that I think
so many parents wish they
could say. But
do they have a voice
sometimes? I don't think they feel
that they do, especially when it
comes to our leas.
And so a lot of times we do
get parents coming up to us and
asking us, can you express this
for us? We're scared
that, you know, our student will
face some sort of backlash
if they voice their opinion in the
classroom or
to a school administrator. And,
and that's not ok.
And so that is in a sense
where we operate as well,
is you know, advocating
and being a voice for those that feel
that they can't or
just simply feel that they've
been, you know, shut out for the
most part. And
so with that, um
again, I want to say thank
you, Chair Romero and to the
Members of the Committee here.
Um Certainly do appreciate your
time. Thank
you.
>> OK.
Uh Good afternoon, uh Mr.
Chair Members of the Committee,
my name is Jeremy Yankee.
I'm the Director of Youth and Learning for Santa
Clara Pueblo. Uh In
my role, I operate as Secretary
of Education for the tribe.
Um And
with this, you know, uh
saying it in, in that
aspect, you know, I think at the
heart of tribal educational sovereignty
is the ability to control our own
destiny. Um Our
tribes pueblos and nations
have been here since time in
memorial. And as
I noted, you know, I don't call
myself education director. I'm the
director of Youth and learning
when we
was, it created my position and
also my division at the tribe,
we had big conversations
about what we wanted to do,
you know, I run educational
programs, but that
wasn't our goal. Our goal
was to learn and to teach
for us as tribes,
we know how to learn and we know how
to teach. Uh for us,
we have done that for
eons for, for
thousands of years. In that aspect,
the term education
is relatively new to us.
You know, that's a new concept,
you know, 100 200 years
for us, for us learning is
so huge. You know,
education is just a small
component of it. Um In that
aspect, in our worldview
of how we look at it.
Um I was a juvenile
justice director before I became
the education director. And
in that aspect, I would always tell
people when you get in trouble,
you know, you go home and you
ask your grandma doesn't tell
you, you know, were you
educated by this? She says, what did you
learn in that aspect?
You know, so immediately that changes
our mindset to have this whole
child concept, this whole community
concept of,
you know, you can go to
our places of worship, our
Kiva, you know, for discipline, you
can go there for learning, you can go
there for healing. There's so many
different aspects that you can go
for. You know. So for
me and my community,
we created the department of Youth
and learning. So in that
I oversee roughly about a
third of the tribe, which includes our
tribal libraries was
our recreation program,
education. Uh
the language program, the head
start. I was
the lead as we built our
tribally controlled Capo community
school. Um in that
aspect, you know, so
we were able to
expand greatly in
that mindset of what we wanted
to do. Um
With the tribal educational
sovereignty. I think there are a few
very big components
of that one. Is the
ability to create our own educational
institutions, you
know, which we can do according
to our own cultural values, language
and traditions, but also
meeting the guidelines, you know, set
by a set by the federal
standards, set by the State
standards. You know, our
teachers are still
um certified by the
State. Um We
still meet those standards, we still
meet the federal standards that are
set by, you know, the Department
of Education in that aspect,
but we're still teaching our
languages, our culturals, our, our
values through our own
systems. In that aspect,
um You know, being able to
determine our own curriculum
in that aspect is a huge part
of it for
us. In Capo
community school. A lot of it is
place based learning because
we've been here for, since time
in memorial, we're not going anywhere.
Uh We've had the fires, we've had the
floods, we've had Spain
come in, we'd have Mexico
come in, we've had the US come in,
all of those have recognized our
sovereignty in that aspect,
you know, there's the legal concept,
the legal grounding of that, you know, going
back to the Guadalupe Treaty
of Guadalupe Hidalgo,
the Enabling Act, as
you know, Mexico became a State,
all of that was recognized
by law in that
aspect, you know, we
have the Indian
Education Act and also the
Federal Act moving forward,
um bringing us
into, I guess what we call the
technological era
in that aspect.
Um But for us, we want to
make it relevant
education for us.
And in that aspect, yes, our
students, you know, we have
tribal Members that work in DC
that work across the world or
in the military. But we
want to create leaders in
that aspect. You know, we need doctors,
we need lawyers, but
we also need our cultural leaders
to keep us grounded at home. You
know, we May have somebody who
is a janitor that
May be the most important
person in, in the village
because of the traditional knowledge
that they hold, that keeps us
together and keeps us whole as a
tribe in that
aspect. Um
I know we've talked about the
flexibility and funding
and I think the administration of
funding for us as tribes,
we are great at it. I will
say that we know how to
braid funding to
create the best impact for our
students. Um In
that aspect, you know, people use the
term local control in that
aspect, but we know
how to do that for us as
tribal education directors.
You know, we're dealing with, with the
bie, we're dealing with Department
of Education, we're dealing with the State,
we're dealing with multitudes
of leas in that aspect,
not even including the charter
schools that, that we have.
Um because our kids are scattered
for myself. My kids from Santa
Clara go everywhere, from
Sio to Albuquerque
public schools in almost every school
or school district in between.
Um in that aspect, uh
for myself, I would say
under my tenure, I'm proud to
say that I've had almost a
valedictorian or
Salutatorian at almost every one
of those schools. Um whether
they are big schools like
Capitol um or small
schools like mccurdy. Um
In that aspect, the I I always
challenge my students. The only one
that district that I haven't had yet
is Espinola Public School.
So every time me and the
lieutenant Governor go visit,
it's, we need one,
we need one from here in
that aspect.
But
um in that paradigm shift,
you know, us, in Santa
Clara, we chose to
change systems and
not just pump more money
into some of these programs.
You know, I think that some of the things that
we're seeing at the State level
and at the le A level,
it's how do we change the
system in that
aspect, you know, for the US being
as small as a tribe, we reorganize
the tribal government to
create my position and to create my
division. Now, in that
aspect, I say some of the
easiest parts is
with my authority that I
have in the tribe. I can tell
people to work together. I don't have
to ask people to work together,
you know, in that aspect, you know,
that's, that's a game changer.
And for us even at the
government to government meetings that we
had, you know, us as the
IE ac Members. Um
I am currently the vice Chair for the
I AC and Dr Moore
is now the Secretary
for the IE ac.
We asked E ce
C DH Ed and
pe D to work together.
He said, how can we have
just one meeting with you instead
of the 67 that
we have for all these
different meetings? You know, can we just
come together and
mov'e that forward?
You know, because we see some of the great things
that E CE CD is doing, you
know, we see some of the, each,
each entity and each
department is, is doing great
things and a lot of times
they're overlapping, you know, how do
we maximize their
efforts to put this into it?
You know, and in 56
years, you know, the work that A CE
CD is doing now pe
D is gonna claim it and say,
no, we, we need a change.
We changed the test last year and we're doing
awesome now, you know, but it
was the work that was put in five
years ago in that aspect,
you know, so that's something that
we want to ask as tribes
is, how do we work together?
You know, we're not going anywhere
in that aspect. We've
been here for thousands of years and we're
going to be here for thousands of years
more in that aspect.
So with that, I
believe we are
ready for questions, but
on, on more detailed answers
but flexible
funding and culturally
relevant curriculum in that
aspect, Kawa. Thank
you.
>> Great. Thank you. All
questions folks
represent.
>> Question.
Can you hear? Yes, thank you,
Mr. Chair. Thank you for
sharing all these
um
many
a lot of information
and, but I have one
question. Um
how is the um
and specifically about structure
literacy, uh science
or reading? How is that
being um um
implemented
in, in, in,
in the tribal education?
Who is not under a pe
D?
Maybe not, maybe
something today.
Hopefully they have
it.
>> Um Actually for Santa Clara
Pueblo, uh we entered
into an agreement with E CE
CD under an Intergovernmental
Agreement um using
some of tribal investment fund
strategies to assist my
early um my header
staff um into
providing more literacy in that
aspect. A great
partnership that we've had is specifically
with our tribal libraries program
um which is often forgotten
within our tribal education
system. Uh because
that really hits
everybody from,
you know, from toddlers
to senior citizens in that aspect.
So we're able to uh partner
with them specifically. Uh
Right now, we are not a site
for the Governor's of literacy
initiatives for the summer
program. Uh But we do run
a summer reading program
um throughout the, throughout the
summer. But then our
tribal libraries program is
really the at the forefront
for both of our schools in that
aspect for the, for the literacy
program. >> And I thank
you, Mr. She, I guess my question
is because
I'm sure that you have done a
better job to some
of us in implementing
Cultural Relevant um
teaching in
literacy.
So, and I want to hear more about
that. Um What are the
aspects that we
can use outside
um B A
system
for Cultural Relevant
teaching?
>> Thank you Chair and thank
you for your question representative.
So we were
just awarded that will
actually go into effect
in July,
the curriculum, one of the
curriculum
development grant through
the IED.
So
my background is
in bilingual.
So I worked mostly
international actually
outside even though I'm from New
Mexico. So
I plan to help and
work with the tribe
on how we develop
the Carris language
and cultural
curriculum to
be like in
stages and
sets similar to what
you would have in English.
But also remember that not
all of the local
languages are written,
right? So
understanding what
bilingualism is
and bi literacy
is even in an
oral language is
important, right?
And having that understanding
and that
not just kind
of writing it off as well. If it's
not written, then the
student is not
literate because
having that is still
a huge impact.
So past
experience working in
the Arab speaking world,
I helped to
really build a
school that had a foundation
of Arabic
language before English.
And I think that's vital having
that home language, as
she mentioned
shows in multiple
studies that
that belonging that
understanding and when you
have home Language
foundation,
generally, students
do better in a second
language long term
and even will end up
excelling past
monolingual peers
like myself, right?
So I have a lot
of understanding of it and
knowledge even though I'm not
bilingual to just be
upfront about that. So
we are working on that.
It is in development. And
I think the biggest thing is
myself partnering with
that curriculum, understanding
with the tribe
and the elders that we'll be
working with and the panelists
to develop that and kind of
bring it together. So
some of the basics of curriculum,
understanding and child
development with
the knowledge of the culture
and the background and how
that will pair together.
So we are working on that and
we have that plan
and we
actually just found out yesterday
we were awarded that grant.
So we are excited about moving
forward in that work.
>> Um Thank you. Thank you,
Mr. Chair. Just one question
is, what else
do we need to support that
bi literacy and bilingual
supports in, in,
in the, in Pueblos. What else
is needed to support
that?
>> Thank you Chair and thank you again
for the question. I
think a huge thing
is
stop dismissing
it. So I know
that the pe D
and, and
some of
the information that's gone
out, even some of the talking
points at the GEGG
to g
constantly talked
about
literacy,
foundational literacy
skills.
And
almost there was
some advertising that went out
last summer that
basically said that if students
can't read and write at a
certain level
by grade
three, then
they're likely not going to
graduate. And it showed some
statistics of how that
works. But what
they forgot is home
language does matter,
right? Foundational
language matters.
So helping
teachers in
schools
to not dismiss
or not diminish
home language,
but to
uplift it, to
see it as a positive,
not to say,
oh, well, they're a
second language
learner. No,
they're multi-language,
right? Like seeing
the positive sides
helping that cultural
shift
is a vital
piece, right? And that
has starts with leadership
either at the government
level, it starts with
leadership at Le
A's and
really has to be
throughout teachers
and even peers
like making sure
that other peers don't
diminish that idea
that you're a second
language that means you're
slower. No,
you already have a
foundation
again. I say myself
like I am monolingual and
having lived most of my
life in non-english speaking
countries,
what do you call a monolingual?
An American? Right.
And that's sadly
true. Like it shouldn't
be, we should
be propagating that
and helping. It's a
global society
and whatever languages you
learn are only
assets and
having your home language is
the first priority.
>> Thank you so much. Thank you,
Mr. X. I mean, this
is beautiful what you just share and
I will add, it's not just a global
society but it's who we
are. And there
is not no best way to succeed
in education, but starting
from valueing
to from wherever they come
and not trying to fix them because
they don't speak that
language, dominant language,
right? Thank you so much. Thank
you, Mr. Chair
Representative Gary.
>> Thanks Mr. Chair. Thank
you all of you for your work,
which is really important.
Um I learned working
with dual language
that keeping
the mother tongue allows
grandparents and elders
to speak with the youngers
and we can't
overestimate how important that
is. Um I have two
questions. I
know that um some
tribal education leaders
have gone to Hawaii
because there's been
such a
powerful
um effort
to use Hawaiian. Of course,
they're dealing with one
native language as opposed
to our State where we
have many were
any of
you
were any of you able
to um visit
Hawaii to see their,
to observe and learn from
them?
>> Uh Mr. Chair um
Representative Garrett.
Fortunately for myself, I, I
was able to do that um
as a Kellogg fellow that
was um while I was developing
the K community school.
Um I went out there to research
many of their school in different
aspect. Um
There's a lot of different things of what
people call immersion. And I saw
a lot of different models in that
aspect uh for
our school in, in Santa Clara
Pueblo. Uh We run a
dual language school. Uh Unfortunately,
we don't have enough speakers
um in our community to
do a full immersion program.
So we have our tawa
teachers coaching
with, with alongside a
english-speaking teacher in that
aspect uh for
myself. Um I
went out first by my
next was uh two
years later, we sent out our table
language program team,
which was about six individuals.
But right before we did open
the school, we actually
sent the entire school
out, you know, because it was
very hard for me to go
out and come
back and tell people what it,
what it was like, what it smelt
like, what it felt like, what it,
you know, what the food tasted like in that
aspect, you know, with us being
indigenous and being very much in
that place based um
setting in place based teaching.
We sent everybody from
the bus driver to the
cooks to the teachers.
Uh We sent about a about a team
of 30 in that aspect so
that they could experience that all
together and really get
what we were trying to do when they brought it
back to, to the couple community
school. Um Fortunately,
with the help of the, the
Kellogg Foundation,
um we were able to send
our new staff uh
last year.
Um Again, so
people that had phased out
or, or come in within the new
year. So we actually send about
a team of 20. So we've been
making a partnership with them,
uh specifically command May
schools and pun on
another leo. Um I
always, if I mess that
up, um please forgive
me. Um But we've been
able to partner with them just
to really see what they're
doing. Uh The hard part
tied to the literacy though
is Hawaiians
have written since contact
uh for us in many of the,
the tribes in New Mexico,
um particularly the Pueblos,
it's an unwritten language.
Um Even for us, we're
doing it more in an academic setting
now, but we just say write
it the way it sounds to you. So the
there's not an actual
system or Executive
system for us to,
to do the writing. So I will
say that's very much the big
difference that I saw between
the Hawaiians and us is
they have written for 200
years.
>> There are some Members
of San Felipe, who
went several years ago,
about six years ago, I
believe I was
not with the tribe at that
time. And
unfortunately, most
of the staff who we
are are either
retired at this point
because they took the head
start team
where they do not work with the tribe.
So recently
Kellogg Foundation has
contacted with us
to see about
pursuing and looking
at how we want to
mov'e back towards that
now that maybe some
there are some hold ups when
COVID happened and how it
was going to continue.
Um I have been to
many other countries with
dual language, but not
specifically to Hawaiian
schools just through my own
work and living
abroad. >> So
thank you and, and
Mr. Chair and I
think you're what a
powerful story
because it does, the
bus driver might be the most fluent
person. So it's a
real powerful example and
I was struck me out of Hawaii's
emphasis on the
parents
classes for the adults
that the students were going home
to. Um My other
question is
um several
representatives led by
Representative Lente
sought to pass House Bill
134 in the last Session.
I think it was the second year we did
it, it was to put
75 million into the
tribal education trust
fund.
One of the issues
was that
all the tribes and
Pueblos
hadn't come
together
um adequately,
I'll say to work
on the bill so that when it came
to the legislature,
many things were worked
out. Is there any
progress on that that you're
involved with? Now,
as we
frankly, we're already approaching
the 60 day Session.
Are, are you offering
insights? Are there meetings taking
place to fine
tune the
establishment of a tribal education
trust fund which is so relevant
to your
work?
>> Uh So far,
I will say this has been a
dream uh for
many years. Uh as you know, you
know, it takes several sessions
to, to push that football pass
into the end zone in
that aspect.
Um I think it's
something that the tribes uh
collectively
want. Um
the details is, is always the
hardest part to work out
for Santa Clara Pueblo though, I
will say we
were
Sadden when House Bill
135 got
tabled. I know
everybody has
their focus on the, the Indian
Education Trust fund
in that aspect just because
it has big numbers attached
to it, you know, for what
was it 100 million, then 50
million in that
aspect. But for
myself, you know, being a tribal
education director,
if House Bill 135
gets passed in that aspect
in a, in a similar fashion, that
will be the game changer,
you know, because that reduces the
administrative burden on
PD as well as the tribe.
It's recurring. It's something
that we can plan for
in that aspect. So I know it
doesn't answer the question
directly. But for Santa
Clara Pueblo you know,
moving towards that recurring
funding that was offered by
135 I
think would be just as impactful
as 134.
Thank >> you. That's very helpful.
Thank
you,
Senator
Souls.
>> Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
Lots of the things we
talk about are driven by
the Yazz
or Martinez Yazzie
lawsuit. Uh when
Judge Singleton first did that and I
read through the 75
or whatever pages as soon as
it came out and
it was based on
that we do not
provide
adequate or uh equitable
education based
on test scores. You know, whether
you like the standardized test or not,
that was the primary thing
was based on reading,
writing scores and math
scores.
Afterwards, all of the
findings indicated the various
things that probably contributed
to that,
but I'm not hearing any discussion
about what
is the goal on
math and English
scores in
order to know that we've made a
difference
in funding through the Martinez
Yazzie lawsuit.
What are we doing? And certainly,
you know, I am culturally
relevant, you know, all of
those types of things,
maintaining native language is
incredibly important.
How is that going to affect
test scores that got
us under this
lawsuit?
>> Thank you, Chair and thank you, Vice
Chair. One of the
things that I would say is
twofold
again, if most
research shows that when
you know your home
language first,
so any
time that a student is learning
a second language, they
say that they stagnate
at the level of their first
language. So if you're
not building the first language
foundation, you're not
going to get the second
language, right? Which
is your English test
scores, your reading test scores,
you're writing test scores.
So if you're stagnating
that by killing home
language or
continuing to not support
that home language, you're
stagnating the second
language. It's
shown in worldwide
research across
languages, both
oral and written
languages.
Second,
as I mentioned, we
offer extended learning
opportunities and I don't
just mean like going
to Washington DC
or wherever else
our library
through the help of
our administration.
Like when I came on,
I saw a need that
we had parents saying we
want your services
but the bus rides,
right. Our kids aren't coming
home until
430 they're
tired and you close at
five. So
I went to tribal
leaders and I got
permission to
open later.
Right? I got permission
to open on Saturdays,
which is not always the
norm, but those of us
who are really working in our
communities, we
find what our communities
need and then we
adjust and we pivot.
So I also have tutors
available every day
until seven o'clock.
I have tutors available
on Saturdays.
We are there.
We rotate in our staff
as well. So I don't
work 9 to 5.
I work until seven. Often.
I come in on Saturdays.
So does Quentin
we have adjusted
because that's what our community
needs is that they can't
just have us there from 8 to
5 like normal office
hours. We're not bankers.
So we help
with homework help.
Our current le A
only has about a
4% math
rate of
proficiency.
So we spend a lot
of time
teaching basic
math skills. We
do that because
our ninth graders can't
do algebra one if they
don't know their basic math
facts, which is what we're kind of
finding, right?
We, so we are trying
to get those foundations
in that whatever
happened, we're not trying to
just play game, whatever
happened where parents weren't
there, whether the teachers
weren't teaching the, well,
whether there was an
accountability.
The point is how do we mov'e
forward, what do we do
from here to
solve the problems?
And that's what we're doing. We're
offering the support
services if
I have a student who needs
help in physics and I can't
help with that, then
I also have the ability
to outsource that tutoring
through. It's not
as great as in person and
tutoring but through
a, a resource of
online tutoring
where I have a contract
that I have with another
company. And then I
set up that tutoring
according to the students
needs. So I also
would say that not all of our students
are low, right? I
have students coming in wanting
help on their calculus
class too. And I'm
like,
ok, so then I
need to pivot that I'm
not going to provide that every
time. But how
do I make sure that those
kids who are excelling
continue to be able
to excel? And that's
where we want to meet those
needs according to
our community,
whatever they are.
And I agree,
math and reading is what
got us here and it
shows that we're not.
But when you say that, you
know, we're talking about culture
and that I would say that is
a foundation
and and again, there's
research across the world that
shows home
language help
second language
and in the tribal
communities,
the home language is their
native language,
right? And maybe
part of the issue is
historical things that have
happened, which has caused
less of that home
language to be available
to have those there
that has caused the
stagnation
of growth. And
now it's time for us to
support that so that we
can see that growth
again. And I would
argue like Natasha
mentioned, I
think anything that we're
doing and we're
proposing for
our native students,
helps everybody,
right? It's not just
about if we're asking that
these things be built
into the schools,
it's not going to harm
also the Latino
students
or the
Majority students, it's not
going to harm them. It's
only going to continue to
help them as well.
Learning that world
view
changes your mindset.
It really does broaden
how you think and your critical
thinking and all
of those aspects when you think
not only to think in your
own way,
right? So when
we bring those things into
schools or partner
with our schools,
then it helps all students,
not just our
students.
>> Thank you and
please go ahead. I don't at all
disagree. It's just
what got us here were whether
you like it or not standardized tests
in math and English.
And so this, you know, getting
out of the lawsuit needs to
focus on how do we
equalize or equitably
uh have
performance in
Math and English.
And then the other things are all around
that. But yeah, the research on
bilingual education for years
is clear of the different
programs and supportive
of the home language while adding
the second language is the
most effective and actually
surpasses the,
the English only
speakers once they
are fully bilingual in
both.
>> Yes, sir, Mr. Chair,
Mr. Vice Chair.
Um to be blunt in
answering your question of how do
we attack, you know, the math
and the reading scores,
I will say trust the tribes
in that aspect,
you know, um and
trust in government comes down to,
to more time and more money
in that aspect. Uh We've
seen from the last LFC
report, the failures
of the public education system and
the local education agencies
have had since the
Indian Education Act was put into
place. Um
As an example, a clear
example, I will say that
the public education department
at the government to government meeting
last week, they didn't
highlight any public schools
at that meeting. They highlighted
two tribally
controlled schools. One
was a Santa Fe Indian school. The next was
a Navato preparatory
school.
The tribes were controlling those
schools, we're doing it ourselves
and those kids are excelling, they're
excelling, they're doing higher in
the math, the reading, the SAT
scores absenteeism
at both of those schools, both of
those schools are outside of the purview
of the public system,
you know. So just as an example, I
will say, trust the tribes
and for us direct funding,
direct reoccurring funding so
that we can operate out of
school time programs. In that
aspect, I know there's always
the question of, well, the tribes
are reverting this, they're reverting
that. But when
extended learning time program was
put into place in the public ed
systems, what the tribes are
reverting at the tribal education
department level was a drop in the
bucket from what the
were reverting. In that aspect,
they had to be forced, you know, it
was a voluntary system. A lot
of the tribes, we took it, we
took it and we ran our own programs.
The extended learning time program
had to be mandated at, at
the legislative level
before it was actually implemented
across the State. So with that,
you know, I would say if we want to
get some of these scores downs, particularly,
particularly with native
Americans, um,
give us the
money.
>> Oh, if only this Committee could
actually fund education at the level
that it ought to be, uh, we,
we put out proposals and they
get chopped back every
year.
Um,
I, I don't at all
disagree. However, the
systems in New Mexico,
with the exception of the
tribally controlled
schools are through the
public school
systems. Um,
and stands well aware, we've
tried to give unrestricted
funds to all of the
districts because districts
that don't have a lot of tribal students, they've
got their own problems of how they
need to fix it
and what we start at stan,
like $200 million
and it got chopped down to about
30 million spread over two
years.
Yeah. And so
for these very things
that local districts
know best, uh,
how to use those
monies and where they're being
used. Uh, I
think, you know, and I'm,
I'm speaking for myself but
I, you know, as I hear other
people,
we are looking
at the schools
in more general ways
and it's typically
through the districts
and that means people have to be
involved at their district leadership
running for school board and other
things in order for the
schools within that district.
Uh, I'm very nervous
whenever, as a legislature
we start mandating
things because the local
school board won't do it.
Well, there are a lot of school boards that
are doing it and you know, I don't
think that's our role
to, to do specific
mandates because some
principal is
not being fair to some group
of students or something of that
sort. Uh But
let me get off that little
soapbox. How
many do you have
programs to
encourage
your tribal
uh students to go into
education? And what are those
programs?
>> So for Santa Clara, we don't
have a specific programs for
educators, uh we offer
them opportunities in that
aspect of
um
we have changed
our scholarship opportunities
so that it's open for everybody, not
just full time students.
So the trades part-time
students, nontraditional students in
that aspect. So it's really just
offering them the opportunities to
get there. Um With
that said, I will say
we have done very well at
growing our own right
now. I can say our administration
for a couple community school is
100% Santa Clara
Pueblo. And at my
head start, my head start is
100% Native American
at this time, you know, so we've
done very well uh
using the opportunity
scholarship using EE DC
scholarships. Um
We've partnered with the
Northern New Mexico Community
College, um
them in particular UN ML
A to get some of our
teachers through school and
also trying to get them
the, the partnership
with, with the language, you know,
um the mentor
was it mentor teacher
um model in that
aspect, one of
the things that I can say, which
probably for us and San
Felipe, um we're
even going out of State right
now. Both of us
have done tribal leader visits
up to Colorado State because
even for us, our
ancestral homelands
didn't stop at the New Mexico
border. You know, we
are, we have
ancestral sites up in Colorado.
So even for
them,
we're using them to even
push on the New Mexico to
push on U AND M because they're
offering our students that
are tribal tribal Members
in State tuition, they're offering them
the same uh benefits
that Colorado students are
getting. You know. So for us
as tribes, we're, we're moving,
we're shaking in that aspect.
Uh but doing grow
our own.
Um
Senator has done well in that
aspect.
>> Thank you Chair. So
currently, um
as you might guess,
even by the fact that I'm
sitting in this position, right?
San Felipe has
struggled with this and
it is something that I
have been charged with
and working towards,
right? I
want to develop a mentor
system. It's something
that I worked on again when I
worked in the Arab world.
I, my goal
was always that as I left
a principal ship
that a local person
was going to take that job
and I was not
there to just
dominate myself. It was
about growing
up leaders and that's my
goal in San Felipe.
I believe that we are working
on that. Um
We are going to, for
example, the NEA
I in October and we're
taking some of our
students who are currently colledge
students studying
education who
are hoping
to
become educators.
So we're taking them to meet
other native educators as
well and
start building that
network. It's a small group right
now, but it is a plan.
We also offer a tribal
scholarship that is open
to part time, full time
and career
tech so that we
are working on higher
education in general,
even though teaching is not
the only area that they can
get a tribal education
uh scholarship
in. We
also do propagate
and try to encourage
we have our head start
teachers. We
have a couple of them who
are working towards their bachelors,
several who have gotten their
associates, but
most of the
teachers in like
our bie school
and at our local
leas, even the
elementary are
not from San Felipe
right now, we are very
underrepresented in our
le A
um
at most levels. In
fact, for being a,
we're in a district that's
about 52%
of the student population
is native American.
And I know I used to work
at the high school
that is with
us. And I believe there
were two
teachers at the high school
that were native
and neither one were from the
Pueblo communities
that
the students were
from, but at least they
are native too. So it is
about building that. And
again, I think it's a pipeline.
So even
though we are working on that. We
also have to know that we have
to retain them.
So we have gotten
some of our like head start
teachers
to their bachelors,
but we have a struggle because
then they go to AP
S or they go to
another place because
head start doesn't pay,
especially at ours
with what we get funded through
the federal government. Right.
So we're working on how we
retain them
and what they can get paid
if they stay. So
that's an issue that we're trying
to work
towards. >> Thank you
because we often hear, you
know, and, and certainly there are
not enough native teachers
in communities,
but we can't just automatically
make people native
that are, are going to teach
uh to be kind of callous
about how to the State. It, I
apologize but
there are programs like educators
rising, which is a high school
career track program
to encourage people to be teachers.
And we know that
teachers out of that tend to want
to go back to their home communities
uh along that same
line. And I've talked with
the Secretary and it's more
of a long term goal. It takes a while to
get it set up but is
trying to get to
teacher preparation
programs
specifically
for native
teachers because
right now it's at
our public universities and
somebody goes to UN M or New
Mexico State. Sometimes
they leave after a semester because of
culture shock and sometimes
they like it and don't go home because
they like being in a bigger
community that
at least
my vision is that
maybe we have a teacher preparation
program out in the Navajo
nation. Uh And
maybe another one at Northern New
Mexico, specifically
around training
indigenous
teachers because
we know that they're more likely to go
home and be teachers again,
which you know, solves
all of that while still having the
full credentials to teach math
and English and everything
else. But with the cultural
sensitivity. So
just kind of a long term
goal is trying to get
more teachers as you indicate
into the pipeline
because we know they're more
effective than at
helping kids get a full
education because of the cultural
sensitivity. And
I'll shut up now and get off my soapbox.
Thank you, Mr. Chair,
>> Senator
Pinto.
Thank you, Mr., Chair Members of the
Committee and thank you for your
presentation.
So a lot of this was
implemented like almost
50 years ago, even with
the funding from the federal
government. But
yet, you know, we say, yeah,
we want to preserve
the, the language.
Um But how much is it gonna
cost?
Well, we need teachers.
Well, how much is that gonna cost? How
many teachers do you need at your
pueblo?
And yet we're still, we're still sitting
here trying to, we, we know the
history, we know that
language is dying.
But where are we going to go
with it? We're saying,
well, we want more money,
the accountability that has to be
tied with this money.
Um because
in some sense, it's
really State money
that you're asking for in
which every taxpayer
contributes to and
we have to have accountability.
But yet you want
flexibility.
But if we don't even know the amount
that we need to reach,
um you know, like, well,
give us some more money, let us have
the flexibility to do
this. But what is
the plan? What is the
outcome?
How much is
it going to be when we
say? OK, now we've reached
our goal. But what
is next?
It has not seemed
to
uh that jurisdiction
in that fine line, especially when you
talk about the two schools with
Navajo prep and Santa Fe
Indian school that
they're Majority
run by Native
American administration.
They're not located on
the reservations, which
I find very interesting
even though you know that land
in Farmington was purchased by the
Navajo Nation.
Why are these
schools not located
on the reservations?
When we say, well, we have
sovereignty, we have ultimate
power to do this. We
want ultimate say
over our students,
location, location,
location.
Um I'm still
waiting to
see, especially when we talk
about the charter schools like
kness being there.
And we're saying, well, they are
successful at
the younger level. But what's the
plan after that? And
I, I've heard them kind of say this
is what's next, what's next?
Um But how long,
when will we get
there? Um
Our students are waiting.
Um I think we've been
waiting since we were
looking at
our age level
here um
that our leaders
kind of, it wasn't on their
forefront, but it is on
ours. But when we
get there in our
lifetime,
all the listing there with the
bie schools, everything's
lacking from technology
to infrastructure, to staff,
everything in the education
system,
but we have not seen an
increase from the federal
government,
but yet we're gonna ask the State to
give this to us.
So
as we mov'e forward
and that's why I was trying to look for some
numbers here in the
report, um,
about how much do we have in there
now? And that was one of the problems
with this education trust
fund was how much are we
spending right now
alone? Just for
our native American students
with all these funding sources
coming in. Because
that
economically, when we talk about
financial impact, we don't know
if we're even gonna
be,
you know, we're saying, well, a couple of
100,000,
is that a significant
impact or is that all,
you know, is that 50% of what
we're spending right now?
Well, the, we had the bill
for 100 million,
is that gonna be significant
enough?
Um We don't have that projection.
We don't have no baseline. We don't have no
foundation even though
we had this funding coming
in over 50 years
ago to our
tribes nations and
Pueblos. Um
are we going to be transparent
about that?
And when we talked about
having the
voice,
the democracy,
the the school
boards,
we know that's where
the influence is, but yet
we settle for an advisory
council, we
expect them to take our
recommendation and
really consider it
seriously.
But yet there's not a vote
attached to it on
that school
board.
So the representation
within our communities
is that effective?
We say, yeah, there's,
you know, half of the school is Native
American. Well,
is that representative
of the real
concrete
decision making
that's going to be
put in there,
you know, where is that in here?
Where is that push? We
say, well, we need more teachers. Well,
maybe we need more school board Members
too.
Ok.
Uh,
it, it's, it's a lot of
work. Um,
I think for us
here at the legislature
is trying to keep things
equal. Um,
but we know
that
there was a shortfall
but how much is it?
You know, it seems like we're trying to
say, well, money is the, the answer
to set this back to
equilibrium.
Uh I, I think it's more than
that and
it's really tough one
because if we don't have kids that are
colledge ready, how
are we going to get the higher
ed in there? How are we going to get
the highly qualified teachers
if we don't require
them to be colledge
ready to go
and get those
licensers
um and settle for less
again, which
makes it unequal again
when we keep doing
something that is,
um
there's a fine line there too
when we talk about culture and implementing
it publicly.
Um because
they, well,
we're gonna limit the access
and limit the culture that's
going to be in the public
school system. But yet it's
supposed to be a place
of equal
education.
But yet we're gonna say, well,
they're not tribal Members so they
can't come into this bilingual
class. I
don't think we can do that
as a body,
but on the reservation
at a school that's located on
the reservation run tribally
controlled. I think
that is doable.
So we have to be very careful what
we are asking for because
also when our kids go
off and we know it's really tough
to have that economic
um build that
economic wealth within our
families
um for the
future
on the reservation
alone,
that they have to go off somewhere
else to do
that.
I hope we can, you know,
continue this report,
get a little bit more in depth
on it. And hopefully even
the data that's going to be collected
will be able to speak to
what, what we
need um
as far as the outcome and
what you guys actually want to
see from
us um the
legislature because
it's a fine line that I walk
through with, with my district
and even with the schools
that I I tour
um and the differences that
I see still today,
even with the resources, even
with the staff, even with
the administration.
So I applaud your
work. It's a long road.
Thank you for your presentation
and it's more of a comment than
questions. Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
You represent me
>> while
thank you Mr. Chair. Um
Thank you for your presentation.
Um One of my main
questions you guys have already
kind of addressed, it was about the extended
learning happening in your
communities.
Um because
uh I, I did attend last
week at the, at the government to
government uh summit and I
got to hear a lot
about,
um, some
of the things that were going on,
you know, some leas are
offering these, uh, extended
learning tutoring, but they don't have
enough money to bring the bus, them
back, back to the
Pueblos later on. They don't, they don't
have the funding. We've
talked about transportation
funding for a while now.
So hopefully that's, uh, we
can fix that, that
part. But
I like the fact that,
um,
putting more money
into
the communities doing the
extended learning because
when it's, uh, when it's
happening
in their community
versus
at, uh, at, at their
high schools or middle schools,
there's, they can
get the whole
child of uh,
um tutoring or,
you know, it, it's, it's, it's a, it's
different and I know you guys
know that, um, a quick
question. Uh, how
many of you, is it, uh, the
schools that are happening um,
or that you have on
um, your pueblos or,
or are they
up to a certain grade or do you
have all the way through high
school?
>> Uh for Santa Clara Pueblo, we
go up through sixth grade.
Um at that point, um
my kids scatter
>> and they're all
over
>> the bie
controlled school, so we
don't have control
of that just to be clear,
uh goes up
until eighth grade. That's
on our pueblo, but it's
not controlled by our
pueblo.
>> Um,
so
once, uh Mr.
Chair and um, once
you get, once they get to,
to middle school high school,
um, I
mean, personally I think we
need to, uh, and, and I'm glad
that we're discussing that later
on even for all students
as far as middle school because I
believe that that's where we lose
a lot of students anyway.
Um, we can, we
can, um,
corral them around in the
younger ages and then
once they get older and develop
even more opinions,
um, um,
then that's what we kind of,
uh, lose them because it's chaos,
you know. Um,
so
um
I wanna ask, um
mostly because I'm, I'm looking at
this from a different lens. Me
personally, um I just
recently finished
uh a micro credential
with uh the New Mexico Education
Act. So I uh I
got to
uh chew on all of that
information then attending
the government to government summit.
Um and then uh
what I get to learn here.
Um I, I really
wanna know and
I got a little bit of
this last week
in Farmington
um because there
was some
schools um in,
in the meeting that I attended,
um
some leas were there
and some
that
the tribes had major
communication gaps
with that
le A was not there.
Um So I
ask,
um I ask
you, how is your
relationship? What's working, what's
not working
and, and what, what
is your biggest ask
for um
communication with your leas?
Because I think that we
need to work together
and I've said it before today, we
need to work together
because that's where
everyone benefits
when we're working together.
So, so what's working, what's
not working? And what's your
biggest
ask?
>> Um Chairman
Romero and um
Representative Moya,
thank you for the question. Really do
appreciate it. I
think that,
you know, for us and our leas
and one of them in particular
that we work heavily
with just because of the amount of
students that attend
that district in
particular, it's
really just the transparency
and honesty portion,
right? We don't
receive attendance
reports in a timely manner.
We don't receive
notice of a student
failing whether that's ad
or an F
on a timely basis.
Either
now if you're going
to put the onus back on us
on a pueblo or a tribe
nation, what have you
to say? They don't care
enough about their students.
It, it's a give and take
relationship. It has to work
both ways we can
make the request for the information.
But if it's not being provided to
us until six months
down the road or even
at the end of the school year, what
then do, are we
supposed to do with that information?
At that point, a
whole school year has gone
by
and that student has effectively
failed fall
semester and spring
semester
in the district,
most districts right will
have a seven period
school year,
seven periods a day is
what I mean to say.
But if they
didn't pass any of those classes,
that's seven credits
altogether.
And you're asking a student to take
on those classes during summer
school, that's almost
impossible on
an online platform to ask
a student 80 hours
per class,
you multiply that by
seven
56.
I mean, I
mean, do the math. It's, it's
not, it's
really not doable for a
student to accomplish
this in one
in, in one summer Session, a summer
Session as far as
we have come to find
this just this past
Session is a
week
to finish seven whole classes
in a week.
I take great
pride in my ability to learn
and to be a good student.
But even
I couldn't do that. I don't know if
anyone here in this room could
finish seven classes in a
week.
I don't think so.
But for us,
you know, in San Felipe, that is
the main that we
have is just,
please include us in this
information if you're not sending
it to the parents and if you're not sending
it to us, this is how these
students fall through the
cracks
and time and time again, we wonder
and we ask why do we have a
student that has been absent
for 75% of the school year?
This is
why.
But you know, in addition
to that, we
do also
make an effort to check
Power school when we
can. But you're
asking us to look
up 500 students
roughly little
over a little less in
Burnley public
schools.
And we don't have the same
level of access as
an administrator does in the public school
system. So
we have to go through each
individual
student,
every single one of them
and to do that not
only for attendance and for
grades, you know,
that takes up a lot of
time.
Um You know, I'll
stop there. But if Doctor Moore wants to
add, she, she can
thank
you.
>> The only other thing that I would like
to add is even
yesterday. We met with
our LE A
and the differences in
treatment
between
maybe a two week
wait response
to our
request
and an immediate answer
on the phone to Sandia's
request.
It makes me wonder
why?
Right.
Is it because Sandia has
more money that they get
quicker responses from the
leas? It's like another
level of treating us
differently or treating
people differently. Like
why can
their ed director be
like, I'm so thankful if
I pick up the phone, I can get
an answer in two
minutes. And I think
to myself, wow,
I asked to help my
students with summer
school extra
hours
and it
took
two months
to finally get a
yes and half
of summer school to be
over. And
I had to go through
hoops and hoops and
hoops and finally
have our Governor write a
direct letter to
the President of the board
before I got a
yes.
But another pub, all she
has to do is pick up the phone
and she gets a yes in two
minutes. And it makes me
wonder why,
like, why is
there differences even
in how
different tribes are
treated?
And the thing that I can come
to is it's just, it's
again, like Sandia has
more influence because
they have more money
and that's not right too. So our
kids are doubly
suffering because
they already doesn't, don't have
the economic abi
like mobility
the same and that
chance the same.
But then even when they have
the advocates trying to
give them the opportunities
or trying to help,
then we get such slow
responses. And
so it, it is
difficult. Our, our
communication is hit and
miss. It depends on
the principle. It
depends sometimes on
the, on the
moods. I think, I don't
know lots of things
and on how sometimes we
get oks and sometimes
it's just silence.
So that would be the thing that I would
ask is also they
want us to sign that
we did
consultation.
But what does consultation
mean?
She Natasha brings
it up in her report,
like does
talking at us
equal consultation.
You know what is
consultation? I
realize that not
we, we're not gonna get
everything we need or
everything we ask for.
It's not, we're not toddlers
to just say, give me, give me, give
me right to throw
a fit if we don't get
everything. But
it's actually coming to common
ground.
It's sad to me that when we're
offering help, like
we're saying, OK, you
can't pay your teachers to
go until seven o'clock.
You can't pay your teachers to
work in on
Saturday.
But we will,
we're not asking you to pay it,
let us do it.
And it still takes
like two months
to finally get a yes.
That's when I'm like, why aren't we
partnering? Why aren't you
using us?
And that's the hard part. So I would
say that
like meaningful
collaboration, that
meaningful consultation,
what does it look like?
It doesn't, it's not just
us saying give
me, give me, give me, it's
not them just saying this is
what we're doing, but
it's about coming together
and saying these are the things
that you can do and these are the
things that we can do, let's
partner and stop
saying it's us versus them
at the end of the day.
If our kids are
successful, it
looks good for the le a
too. Like, it
only increases their
numbers and their statistics
too. So don't
hinder us from helping.
That's, it's
definitely a rocky. We,
we have other
leas that we work with. We
have about 100 kids in AP
S, we have 50
kids in Rio Rancho
and we often get
better communication and
lines of support with those
150 kids
than we do the 500
that are in our main le A
which is hard. It's
difficult.
>> Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
I often
um
I wonder and I don't know if
maybe there's something, is there,
is there dedicated
staff in each of these
leas to
um and, and,
and is is there,
are they like, is
that their only job
or is, are they
doing multiple things
and run so thin that, that
it's, yeah, you
know, like that's especially
these schools with a high percentage
of uh of
um students
>> in several school
districts.
Mr. Chairman
and Representative
Mito IA in several school
districts, there is a
Native American or
tribal liaison.
Um and
the le A um
that I think the
um Doctor Moore
and um Mr. Candelaria
are talking about does
have a tribal
liaison
um
um to my knowledge,
he's um pretty
fantastic. I think he's
been really helpful
in terms of our
under understanding
of tribal sovereignty
and, um, the
work that he has done with that
district. Um I
think that
there's always work in
terms of supporting
and, or bridging
relationships.
Um, but
there, in many, there
are not
all and I think that's
also part of,
um, uh, the issue
in terms of size and
districts.
>> All right. >> Thank you. >> Thank
you.
All right. I don't have anybody
else on my list. Thank you all
so much for your presentation.
We look forward to continuing the
conversation as this year goes
by. Thank you.
All.
All right, with that. We'll
go to our next item, which is
the director's
report.
Ok.
But it was a test.
>> I forgot about
it.
>> That's,
we'll give that a
moment.
We already voted on stuff.
Yes.
>> Ok.
Um Well,
um Mr. Chairman, Members of the
Committee for
my director's report, I
have a few items.
Um I'm gonna briefly
talk through the things that we
typically do during a director's
report, the newsletter,
uh providing a budget update
for you all. You'll find this
behind Tab
six.
I will talk a
little bit about personnel and
so I have some um
people who have joined me at the
table that I
will uh give them
the microphone so that they can
share. Um
And then I'm going
to um
talk a little bit about
experience that I had
um at Harvard
and I have some gratitude and
thanks for you. All to
share. Um
So the first thing I'm gonna do
is just briefly go over
the LES C newsletter.
It's the first newsletter for
this interim since we didn't
provide one with the first
meeting in May due to our
work plan.
Um We have three
main articles
in the newsletter. The
first is on building a world
class teaching profession
and this is a short
synopsis for the
public of the
presentation that you will hear
tomorrow led by
Annie
Armitage. It was
a collaborative effort,
really wonderful effort
between les C and
LFC.
Um Annie
and Sonny wrote the report
together. It's about
teacher supports. So
um you'll know a
couple of things. I'm just going to
repeat one paragraph
in the article
that there was a joint
hearing already
um for
LFC
and really what I want to highlight
here from this
article and then the main takeaway
again for tomorrow. I don't want to steal
their thunder, but
in terms of building
the teacher profession,
what is needed is a comprehensive
approach. No
one policy is
going to solve this issue
and I'll just leave
you with that little nugget.
And hopefully tomorrow's
report will sort of build off of
that. The
letter from you, Mr. Chairman
um has three
particular points that I want
to highlight for the public.
The first is the
notion of collaboration
is a founding principle for
you all as a Committee
um as we work well
together on behalf of New Mexico.
your work
collaboratively as a Committee
in a bipartisan way to
uplift education and focus
on the systems,
the comprehensiveness
of the work that you hope
for the Committee to do.
Looking for whole
Solutions
and the stamina that
you ask of
all stakeholders
to work through
the entire interim
Session with you
leading up to the 60
days and the importance of that
stamina and the importance of the entire
interim process
that then leads to
Session rather than
just coming forward with policy
ideas that
Session
um on the back of
the newsletter, I'll point
to two different things. The first
is the
nice report that you'll
see on Tim's work in the
school district data
dashboard that he put
together. And
then there's a small snapshot
of the chronic absenteeism
data that he also,
he and Jessica presented
alongside LFC
this morning
with that Mr.
Chairman, I'll mov'e on to the
budget. There's
a quick, very
easy read for the budget update
for us. Um We're
coming under
budget once again
this year, which is a good thing.
We're a little bit closer
aligning where travel
is most
impacted.
Uh We will
have, we'll close
out a little closer than it actually
shows with the travel
costs. Now, in June
that we'll have to close out.
So, um
we also have
um a pretty full staff
now, which is a good thing.
So
I'll mov'e on
to um one
other item before I actually
mov'e to personnel and
open up this panel
of illustrious
colleagues.
Um I do want to mention for
you, Mr. Chairman a little
bit and um talk
through uh
what is happening with the
fine arts community right
now. Um We've had
quite a significant
amount of outreach
from the fine arts
community community.
Um I, I'm
guessing you'll probably
hear from them again during public
comment today,
I do want to say
that
there May be some
misunderstanding
about
what LES C actually
asked for and, and or is
proposing and, or
thought about in terms
of fine arts.
And I know that I've
communicated this in terms of activity
ports and for you all and supporting
you in
our own communications.
But in terms of a public
discussion, I just wanted
to support you
again in saying
that
in the comprehensive
review that
was required
of us per the
memorial.
Uh Daniel
Aignan did a fabulous job
last year of looking at
every factor
that affects the
SCG
fine art is just one
of many factors as you
know, and as
you know,
all of those factors,
all of the processes
including bilingual,
which is an application
and fine arts,
which is an application
simply roll out to the
districts to leverage
the dollars as they so
choose
regardless
of the process of the
application.
That being said,
one of the things that we
took away from the
the review, not
necessarily action, but just
the comprehensive
review
was looking at the way that pe
is funded. And
could we
in our quest to
continually
increase funding for arts
as we have championed
in the past couple of years,
possibly even
increase fine arts more
and or require
fine arts in
statue, simply
similar to pe
as we embark on this
SG G revision,
it seems there's been some
confusion in the fine
arts community around this
process and
about how seg
actually functions.
Um We certainly welcome
them to come and speak to staff.
I think Merritt and Daniel
have been just
remarkable. I want to
acknowledge the two of
them because
they've been really fabulous
in their support.
Um
And certainly, if it's
not something that the
community,
particular stakeholders
who we so value
as you know, um we
deeply value our stakeholders
in education.
If it's not something that's
interested that they're interested
in, then we
listen
and that's very important
for
us.
We always
listen.
So I just wanted to reiterate the
support for you that we will
continue on this ongoing
support sort
of clarify in a
public
venue. What's
happening
and or also continue
to just reach out
if you need
support
in terms of personnel.
Um, again, we're fully
staffed. We have a
fabulous team of
analysts already
introduced, um as of
last
Session.
But right now we've got,
we've entered into our summer phase
of our internships
and we pivoted to do something
a little bit different this
year. So, rather
than just
hiring
interns, we
thought we would prioritize
teachers
and we created
a program
called AOSA
program which is a teacher on
special
assignment.
So we have two
incredible
fabulous teachers
who are working with us
this summer and they're going to
have the opportunity to introduce themselves
and share what they're doing
and where they teach.
Um And then we
have two fabulous
interns. One is
working directly with us and one
is working actually for
Senator Wirth's
office, um but
is very, very interested in education
policy. So
they will have the opportunity to talk
about themselves, introduce themselves
and what they are also
working on and supporting us.
So that Mr.
Chairman, I'm gonna turn it over to
Viviana who can talk,
introduce
herself.
So
>> Mr. Chair Members of the community,
my name is Iana Cisneros.
I am an educator
for Albuquerque public schools.
I have been one
for 11 years
now and
then I also do some contract
work with the legislature during
Session and now
was wanting to kind of get the
experience of the interim
and how things come to
be. And
currently, my special
assignment is to work with
senior fiscal analyst
Daniel Estupinan who
is like Gwen
mentioned just
fabulous, knows a lot.
And so I get to work with him
on the S
CG revision,
particularly
the potentially
adding an el factor
apart from the at
risk factor
that we currently have in the S
CG. And with that, I'll
turn it over to
Tara.
>> Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and
Members of the Committee, my name is
Tara Mangoni. I
too am an educator in Albuquerque
public schools. Um
This will be my
10th year teaching
in AP S.
Um
part of the reason I wanted
to do this is because
it feels sometimes
when you're on the ground level,
that policy comes
down and you have to do
it and we don't always
know where it comes from. So I was
hoping to get a better
understanding of that,
which I already have.
I've read a lot. Um So
we've already, you know, kind of
delved into that, but my special
assignment this summer comes
from um
sort of a special place in my heart
where I teach now is in
a more affluent area, but
that's not where I started
teaching. And when I
started teaching, I dealt with a
lot of students that were
dealing with homelessness,
um several foster
students in my class and
I school and I
just
always sort of had a heart
for that and felt like what
are the ways that we can support them
better. So my special
assignment this summer is working
with policy analyst,
Natasha Dalos
on homeless
and foster students
and um reaching
out to stakeholders, getting a better
understanding in
our State around the country of
how um
those particular needs of
those students are being met.
And I'm very excited
to be
here.
>> Hello, Mr. Chairman,
Members of the Committee, my
name is Usu Sana.
I am a student at Los Alamos
High School. I'm going into my
senior year this year and I'm
entering for the
summer uh in the LES
C. Um This
summer, I will be working with
senior policy analyst Jessica
Hathaway to
work on middle school
restructuring, hopefully
making a working group
to,
to address some of the issues
with middle school and some different
models. And I will
hopefully be coming back in October
to report to this Committee
on the findings with
that working group. I'm very excited
to be here and I'm very grateful to
have this opportunity to learn about
education
policy.
>> Um Good afternoon,
uh Chairman and Members
of the Committee. My
name is a Van Ween
and I am
currently interning with
Senator Wirth.
Um I had
a particular interest in
uh New Mexican
education and
education po So
I um while
discovering the different parts of the
legislator, I spoke with the
LES C and
found that I was
very interested in the work
that they were doing. And so
um and
so I decided to um
ask them whether there were any
opportunities to,
to help them and uh work
with them. And so I'm
currently uh working
on a project with, with
John. Um
we're working on education
governance and uh
different structures
comparing, comparing how, what
New Mexico is doing to other
states uh
examining what's working and
what's not in our current
system. Um
And uh
seeing what kind of
goals we can uh accomplish
and uh look forward to
in the future.
Oh, yes, I uh
I am currently a
or I'm going into my senior year
um at Amherst College in
Massachusetts, a 30
hour drive away. Um
I am, I'm
studying political science
and economics.
Um I
grew up in
Kazakhstan, so I lived
there for 10 years and then I
lived eight years in Oman
after that. So
um I have
studied internationally
and uh learned about the
different structures of education
abroad and
uh with that, I
speak four
languages. So
um I'm hoping to
implement uh what I've
learned abroad and from
my other experiences both
in colledge and in high
school abroad with
uh with into New
Mexico's education
system. Thank
you.
All right, welcome to you all.
We look forward to working with you
all.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Um As you can see,
our team is really excited
to welcome um these
amazing
individuals and
they're all stellar
in, in so many ways.
Um I actually just
got to meet them on
Monday
um since I've been gone
and um actually, except
for Avery who I got to meet
right before I left.
Um But I, I
want to take a, a
personal moment
of privilege and
highlight two people who are here and
then I'll talk a little bit
about um where
I was for the past three
weeks and um express
some deep gratitude
for this
role and for you as
a Committee.
Um So the first
thing I'd like to do is actually
recognize two people who are
in the audience
um and not get
emotional,
you can see them on this wall.
I'm not gonna point what
year
because I
don't want to out
them.
But my mom and my aunt
are here.
So if you're stand up
Priller and
Jin
and um Mr. Chairman,
they are both educators.
Um They've been teaching, I
think over 75
years, maybe 80
years. Yeah,
comprehensively.
Um You, you can
sit,
thanks.
Um They grew up
here
um
And
um
I am an educator because of
them.
So um
I just wanted to recognize them
and acknowledge the work
that they have done in their careers.
Because they're still
in education,
like many of you
just devoted to New Mexico
and this
career.
Um So Mr. Chairman,
I want to thank
you and
vice Chair Souls in particular
because I came to you
um in
April and said, I think I'd
like to do this program.
I had heard about it because
LFC has participated
in it. A number of individuals
from the uh there and I had heard
about it. Director
Sali had really spoken
highly of it. Miela
Fisher had spoken very highly
of it. And
um um
shared that was really interesting
and or eye eye opening
in terms of uh
the work that we do as staff to
serve, serve you.
And it's a program called
State and local
executives and government
through Harvard. And it's
three weeks.
Uh So, um when
I asked you if I could apply
um to go
and you um both
enthusiastically supported
this. Um
I did not realize that actually
LFC, two people from LFC
actually also
um had applied
and we're gonna go, I didn't
find out actually until a couple of weeks
before I left.
Um So it was a nice
surprise and offered
me um
a one of the unexpected
benefits of the program was a friendship
that I developed with Ismael
Torres and Connor
Jorgenson from
LFC.
Um and got
very close to them because the
program is extremely
intense. It,
it was very,
very rigorous. Um
Essentially, it's
classes all
day long, um
starting at about
7:30 a.m.
where you do an intense
mandated
study group
all the way till 530
and you even have lunch together
and often that's presentations
or discussion and
then there's evening events
and then there's an even a weekend
thing that you have to do as a, as
a group and there's homework
every night. And,
um, thank you to Alonso
who printed up five binders of
worth of readings that I had to
do.
Um So it was
extremely rigorous,
what I'll mention about
the program uh
or um is that the
upshot of the whole thing is
about good
governance
and it was so it was refreshingly
different for me because it was not at
all based on
education.
Um Some of the topics
I'll briefly mention are
were history of
politics. Um
sort of the um
statistical analysis
around why there's
partisanship
and, or the, the
um history of what has
happened in the United
States, um
policy modeling
and different takes on
policy and how it comes
to be
um program
evaluation for effective
State agencies
and how to get towards that
or mov'e towards that
effective communication,
including both speaking
as well as
writing for better
effectiveness and supporting of
you all as staff.
Um And then sort of
broadly reflecting
on the role you have
as
leaders
in government.
And um there
was a quite a variety of
individuals who were there. We became
a very close cohort cohort
of 60. There
were mayors, there were
fire chiefs from
large
cities, there was police
chiefs from large cities.
Uh There were
legislators.
Um I got
to be good, close friends with the
Majority leader from Colorado.
She was there. Um
There was legislators
from Mississippi, um
Ohio,
South Dakota.
Um And so I encourage
you to look into it because
it is, it is very beneficial
in terms of
how you understand
government and or
governance in
general. Um
Whether that's from
my c as staff supporting
you or as an elected
official, um
there were city um
managers from large
cities. So it was
really an amazing
experience and I'm
very,
very grateful
um because what it did
is it uh
for me in many
ways, how
lucky I am
to be in this role
and serve you and
um really
how amazing you are as a
Committee
just hearing about some of the
other issues that other
others struggle
with, I think across the
nation. I appreciate
you and how committed you are to
public education,
um how you work
together,
um how you hear and
listen,
staff
and engage with us.
So I have
a card for the Committee and
I'll present it to you, Mr.
Chairman.
But with
that, um will all stand
for questions
>> all right questions, Committee
Members,
anything
represent Garrett. There >> you
go. Um,
two questions
for our Gentleman. What
countries
were I, it kind
of was hard to
hear.
>> No problem at all. Um,
Chair and Members
of the Committee. Um I
lived 10 years in Kazakhstan,
so Central Asia and then
eight years in Oman, the
Middle East.
>> Thank you. And, um, for
our APS people. Can you tell us your
school's both past
and present and what
grade?
>> My
Yes, currently I'm at North
Star Elementary.
And prior to that, I was at
Hawthorn Elementary and
I teach fourth
grade. It's my
favorite.
>> I
Mr. Chair
Representative Garrett,
I have been at
Wary Elementary in the
International District for the
11 years I've taught,
I've done Majority
K through second, but I have had
some experience third through fifth and this
next year I will be an
interventionist and all
of it has been
in the bilingual
setting
representing me to my
>> boy.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um
Thank you. Um
I am so
excited to see teachers here.
Um uh
Especially you guys.
Um I've been teaching about
the same length as you guys have.
Um And, and I have
to say Tara, um the reason
why you said you, you, you
came was the reason why
I'm a
legislator
because um
you, you, uh what
I've learned
being in this seat
for my profession,
I could have never learned anywhere,
anywhere else.
Um So May I ask
both of you. Um
What is your biggest
hope
when you're done with this to be
able to take back to your
classroom? That, that
and, and, and what do you
think is, how is this gonna change
you as
an
educator,
>> Mr. Chair
and Members of the Committee? I'm
going to be really honest, I think,
like I said earlier, the main reason
was really kind of just understanding
the process in the interim.
And so
that
when,
when I get policy, when I
get rule, you
know, when I read
statute, I
understand
what process all
of you went through
the thoughtful
conversations that I
see that you guys all
have
kind of take meaning for me
when I have
new
guidance that I have to
implement. And
so
really when I returned
back to my
school, being
able to even explain that to my
colleagues when I
sit as a leader as
an instructional council
or in different
capacities that I
try to involve myself
in within the school setting or even
district. And so
kind of adding that missing
piece to the puzzle if you
will, because having the opportunity
to be present during Session
and hearing the conversations has
been a very
um insightful,
but I've mentioned this
to the Committee quite a bit,
the staff that
sometimes, well,
not, sometimes I usually always felt like I was
missing something or always felt a little
behind because unlike
now, I didn't
have a lot
of time to go through reports
as thoroughly as I have been doing
the last couple of weeks here.
And so
that's also been helpful
in understanding just the
processes the Committee
goes through
>> Mr. Chairman and Members
of the Committee, a lot
of what I will take back is
similar to what
Viana. I'm so sorry,
honey Viana has
said. But
also I think
for me because
I, I do also a lot
of things at my school
site. Um But
one thing that I do is I have a really
close relationship with my
fourth grade team. We
eat lunch together every day.
Um So that's often
where we start the conversation
of we don't understand
whatever policy guidance
that it is we have to
implement. So I
think I sort of
already started taking
things back to my group.
Um I
was explaining last night
that I have a
group of
teachers that we
have sort of like a group chat
going on and every day
they want to know. Well, first of all,
what my outfit of the day is
that and
also because they're used
to me dressing down a lot. Um
But then also did
you guys know that?
And so that's sort of what they
call it. And so every day I'm
saying, oh, you know,
that's where this comes from.
That's why we're doing this.
This is why they're having us
do this. And so the
conversation has already
started and I hope to continue
that. And as far as what I
will take specifically to my
classroom, I think also
as a teacher, when you have a better
understanding of the
origins of what it is, you're
being asked to do,
it's
easier sometimes to
implement it. And
um so even with,
for instance,
the 180
day, 1140
my kids didn't understand
why do we have to do more school?
Why do we have to? And I
can't explain it to them
fully because they're
fourth graders. But I think now
I have a better understanding of
that. I can
sort of make it easier
for the students in different
ways. Um, I also
have, um, some Native
American students in my class
and there are just a lot of things that I hadn't
understood and
in just the 2.5,
3 weeks that I've been
working with Les C,
I've gained a little
bit better understanding and I
hope to
use that more in
my teaching.
>> Thank you. Thank
you Mr. Chair. I, I'd
love that.
Um, I
think a lot of times I
think that was, I have to agree. That
was the one of the
biggest things before
I became a legislator.
You get the
information and it's
filtered through the person giving you
the information, whether
they agree with that
information or not.
Um And now
if at one thing, you know where to
find the information and how we
talked about it and watch it for
yourself if you need to. But
I think that there's so many teachers
out there that have never
even given what we
do here a thought
other than what they have
to do about it.
Um, and,
and the more that they
research this, the more
they understand
when it comes when, like you
said, when it, when it comes down
there, the thought, the
discussion, the,
the, um, the time
that it took that it's not
just something that we came up with
and then proof in, in two weeks
it was done. You
know, it's,
it's, it was eye
opening for me. So I think
the more teachers that we can
get a part of this
process,
the more
beneficial it could
be to all of our
students in New Mexico. So thank
you. Thank you for
being on your
assignment
>> for a second time. >> Thank
you, Mr. Chair and
to both of our teachers and to our
two interns too.
I'm here because I didn't
like with the legislature
and what my legislator
specifically was doing to
teachers. So it's
not just understanding why
people do things.
But if, if laws
and policies that you're
expected to do
are not really acceptable,
it's important for you to speak back
up. Just a
reminder,
>> represent Gula.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you. I just have one
request for uh
director
Peria.
Could you share? No
now, but whenever you have some time,
things that you learn on
that, uh I
would love to hear about
what is in the bigger picture.
Um We don't have
sometimes the training to be here
and I speak for, we have
training for teacher but not to be in this
role, I'm learning on the process.
So it would be really helpful
to have some insights from
you since you have the opportunity to
participate in that. Thank
you,
>> Mr. Chairman Representative
Guolla. Yeah, perhaps in
July, I can do a quick
powerpoint and take
maybe 30 minutes and do a
presentation for you all and
more in depth and of
course, meet with you
Mr. Chairman. I'm going to take a
quick
make a quick announcement that I
forgot in my presentation. And
Jessica reminded me
our middle school study. We
are looking to put together this
working group that Shuei mentioned
and we had sent a notice
to all of you for
poten potential
um representatives
or people from that
are constituents of yours
who might want to participate. And so
this is just a quick reminder for
you all on
that.
>> All right. Thank you.
Cool. Thank you all, I
appreciate it.
All right. So we're going to mov'e to public
comment um for
this. We'll take the folks that
are here in person
first, then we'll
um in that
time we don't have anybody
online, but in case once we
hit the 330 mark,
it starts getting populated, then we can
mov'e to the folks that are online.
Um If not, we
won't,
but we'll start off.
Remember folks you have
up to two minutes. We
appreciate you being
here.
Um
Stan
first on the list early
this morning, I'm
sure.
And here is a mess >> video. >> Of
course >> she
talk to help >> you
>> there. Mr. Chairman. Can you hear me?
Ok, >> we can and
soon as you start, you will
>> start two minutes.
I'm staying rounds. I'm the
Executive for the
New Mexico Coalition of Education
Leaders. But today I'm
speaking on my
role as the exec for the
school superintendents.
You're aware of our lawsuit
with the public education
department. It really
is coming down to this. We filed
for summary judgment
on both sides
and I've had a chance to review
all of those matters. Here's
my request of you as a
Committee, regardless
of what the ruling of the court
will be. It has
come down to
what does rulemaking look
like
and when is it in conformity
with law or not?
That's really the essence of the
matter.
And we are
likely to come to you as an
association
and ask you to
help us
clarify in
statute,
what that looks like
and I just want to give you a quick
heads up. Our
hearing is next Tuesday,
June the second
in Roswell in District
Court. We'll see what
the judge's ruling is at that
point
regardless of that
outcome. I believe
it's incumbent on us from a
policy perspective
to do some work
in statute. So we can
clarify for future
Executive and
also for future field
representatives. Thank
you.
>> Thank you,
Stan.
Uh I have
Nancy. Next.
Hi, Nancy.
Yes.
Good afternoon. Thank you for joining
us. Welcome.
Oh, Nancy, if you
would, there's a button
with a little person
and volley. There we go. >> Thank
you. Good afternoon,
Chairman Romero and the
Committee, my
name is Dr Nancy Pauley.
I just handed a, a
hand out to you.
Um, obviously in
two minutes, you can't cover what I'd
like to cover. Um I
am a UN M Professor Meria
who taught art education for
20 years. I'm
here to discuss the fine arts
education law
as a basic human,
right? And, and
as Dr we
mentioned at
the meeting on December
13th on
page 40 it was
proposed that the fine arts
be removed from the
State. Guar
State
equalization guarantee
fund funding formula.
We in the arts are
extremely upset
because we feel
as those students throughout
the State won't be
given equal
access to the fine
arts if the
fine arts aren't on
a separate item.
I it's line
five that goes
into every district.
I particularly want
to point out that art
education is a human
right that has
been ratified
by the United Nations in
1990
article, 31 states
that Children must be able
to quote, fully
participate in cultural
and artistic life
with equal opportunities
for cultural, artistic,
recreational and leisure
activity. If this
is removed
from the guarantee
for equal treatment for
all the Children of New Mexico.
Yes, you'll see the arts
up in the heights, you'll see the
arts in Santa Fe, but you
will not see equal
treatment. And the reason
this is so important is we
have a huge creative
industry in New Mexico
and they will not be prepared
for the jobs that are
in those industries. They
we they will not experience
the culturally relevant
education we provide
in the arts that meets the
requirements of the Martinez
Yazzie lawsuit decision.
They will not be able to create
art, perform music,
dance and drama, to express their
own feelings, ideas
and cultures. They will
not be advancing their
brain development as
studies that I have in this report
show and they will not
participate in the social,
emotional learning opportunities
that creativity with other
people provides.
So that's the end. So
uh of my two minutes, I
believe, but I've just
explained with um
detailed studies,
quantitative studies.
Um how each of these
items have been
proven, especially
I think >> people will be. We
do have it. Yes.
Thank you so much. >> And please
look at the pictures because
a picture tells us a
lot about some
of the things we've been doing in the arts.
Thank >> you. Thank you,
Amy.
>> Good
morning.
So I'm not used to
sitting when I
present,
>> join the club here. I've
been trying to take walks. Can
you restart it manie? Just
whenever she starts her presentation, we'll
start it.
Welcome. >> Good morning.
Thank you for listening.
My name is Amy
Sweet and I'm a
teacher in a PS
and this was my 35th
year of teaching in a
PS and
I was 13
years at Emerson
Elementary in the International
District. And now
for the past 22
years at a dual language
school in Albuquerque, a title
one school is San
Jose and
at is San Jose. I've
had the privilege of being an
art and literacy
teacher.
The teaching has been
amazing,
but
I'm here to really
emphasize the importance
of art
funding being
directly allocated
to the arts because
I can't tell you
how challenging
it has been for
the past 20
years.
Every single
year, I've had to
advocate for my
position
one year, it's gonna
be cut because we need a
preschool program. The
next year, there's a
new idea of transformational
coaches. So
that will come from my
budget or
the next year will be
instructional coaches
or the next year, it will
be a community
coordinator.
So every
single year
I've had to go up and
say why my
job might be more important
than a half time
librarian.
And it's
excruciatingly
painful
when that money
isn't allocated
for the kind of work that I
do what
I do. And I think to
myself, everyone said, Amy,
why do you put yourself through
that? But the
reason I put myself
through that is
because the work is
so valuable.
It's how kids
learn. I
teach art and
literacy and the
level of engagement. And
it's not just the arts,
even though the arts are
valuable in itself,
but the arts
engage students
and they enhance
academic
learning.
And I guess I
can't go on. I have so
many student samples.
I don't know if I'm allowed to
share them with you,
>> please leave them with us. So
we can actually, if you want to start,
I wanted the end of the
table or a couple and
split them up and then we can kind of
work them toward the center and
around. >> Ok. Wonderful.
I have lots of work to look,
lots of student work
to look at and student
voices. And
I really feel like
this is the way
to communicate Yazi
Martinez because
curriculum is
based on the lives
of our students. So
it's culturally relevant
and all curriculum needs
to start with the lives of
our students. And thank
>> you, Amy, if you could send
them out and then we'll get the next
person up. Thank you,
Michelle.
You have Michelle. Oh, there's
Michelle.
>> Good afternoon. >> Hi, good
afternoon.
Welcome,
>> Chairman Romero. Members of the
Committee. Thank you for this opportunity
to speak.
Some of my colleagues have requested
opportunities to present
to the LASC, but we've been redirected
to public comment.
So that's why I'm here
today. My
name is Michelle Lemons. I'm the Executive
director of the New Mexico Art Education
Association. It's a statewide
organization established since
1972.
I have served in leadership for 28
years including as the elementary division
director of the National Art Education
Association where I advocated for
the Fine Arts Education Act
2003 as
model Legislation
for other states to emulate at
the national level.
And they have
this critical bill was
responsible for my career as
well as hundreds of my colleagues across the
State.
Um I myself
educated over 15,000
students while in the classroom.
And I can tell you firsthand what an
enormous struggle funding was like
before fa e A
funds were dedicated to the
arts
when they were a base
unit.
Those stories were why
the bill, those stories of myself
and my colleagues were why the bill was
introduced and the money is dedicated
to fine arts to begin
with. In
response to the SEG
report that
mentions the possible removal
of the FA E application and
to the subsequent LES C
memorandum,
respectfully,
the New Mexico Art Education Association
stands firmly against any
proposal to remove the E A
application and potential removal
of A E FA E
A as a program unit currently
in line five of the seg where
it has been successfully
dedicated for over
20 years. The application
is a program plan
with a budget. It is
not a grant as stated in
the memorandum
without a year long study of the
impact to districts. We do not
see the urgency to change
what has been a successful
dedicated funding
and potentially it
might negatively
impact the art education programs
across the State impacting
100 and 65,000 students.
Approximately in
K six
statewide
administrators have shared with us
how easy the application process
is. So we do not understand the burden
mentioned.
>> If you have anything in writing, we'd
be happy to have
it.
>> I can email
>> if you would. That would be awesome. >> Thank
you. Can I
respond to one thing that
we had?
Thank you. We're
encouraged to hear that
there's interest in
dialogue and we're also
encouraged to hear there's been staffing
increases at pe because we
would love to see the two
fine arts education
positions reestablished
at PE D. That's very encouraging for
us. Thank you. Thank
>> you. All right,
we
have
>> thank you, Mr., Chair Members of the
Committee, Joe Guilin,
Executive director of the New Mexico
School Boards Association.
Just wanted to give you a brief update
since we heard uh
last uh
thank you for all the work that you
do. Uh Since we saw
you during the Session, we
went out and we did eight region
meetings across the State
briefing our
Members on all of the
accomplishments of the last
legislative Session. So thank
you so much for that.
Uh We also conducted our
school law conference at the end of
May. We had over
600
administrators and school board
Members in attendance.
Senator uh Souls
was one of our keynote speakers
and he did an excellent job uh
representing you there
as well. Uh We're
also right now working on
our leadership
retreat which will be
in Taos in the next two
weeks and we'll be
providing training for our school
board leaders presidents,
officers and our board
of directors, Doctor
Wena. That will be our keynote speaker
and she'll be briefing us
on the
uh the um
ambitious Les
C work plan that you have
uh for the interim
period. So
I also wanted to let
you know that we're working with
Ped and
uh Les C on
transition to the new
Senate Bill 137
training requirement. So
we're busy doing that.
We're also busy
serving as Chair and
as a member of along
with uh uh uh
Gwen on the
public School Capital Outlay
Council and we'll
have a oversight task
force meeting next Monday. So
again, I just wanted to brief
you on our activities since we
last saw you.
Thank you and again, thank you
for the work you're doing during the
interim.
>> Great. Thank you.
We don't have anybody
online. Should we give
it some way time? Leave that
too many.
Ok. Dang you,
you toss that potato
right back in my lab.
Ok,
cool. Well, thank you
all so much for today. I just want to
say that.
Um Certainly
we and I think I speak
as um
not just for myself but for the Committee
in our support for
Fine Arts. I'm
the husband of a fine arts
teacher at Kick Harson Elementary
School. Um
So very much.
No. And here
um a lot in detail and I was speaking
with some folks that were
here earlier about
the issues with
um fine arts and
teaching fine arts in our elementary
school. So I was very sympathetic
to that. Um, and I know
as a Committee we voted on
several things like the director mentioned
to expand, um, fine arts
education. So it's something we
certainly look to look
forward to working with you all
into the future on. So,
thank you all. Um, I
believe we start tomorrow at nine
o'clock. I'm gonna double check just to make
sure nine o'clock. Um,
Thursday. So we'll see you
tomorrow at nine
o'clock. Bye folks.
