Um, a brief introduction, um,
Purpose of this hearing,
We all know what it is, but in
case there's any members of the
media, members of the public,
I want to explain what it is
we're doing and why.
Ever so briefly.
The purpose of this hearing is
to make a recommendation.
To the standing ethics
Committee.
Uh, of the Senate, the standing
Committee.
Regarding a formal complaint.
Under the
Anti-harassment policy of the
legislature.
Again, Senator Mimi Stewart by
an employee.
Of the set
Uh, specifically, that complaint
resulted in an investigative
report dated May 8, 192025.
By attorney Lorna Higgins
Wiggins.
And submitted to the
investigative committee.
And to this committee as well.
Uh, which has been made
available to the parties.
Uh, that investigative report is
essentially the charging
document.
In this case, it has been
reviewed by everyone.
Uh, that investigative report
resulted in a finding of
probable cause, which
Uh, invoke this here.
Based on that investigative
report, the finding of probable
cause, this hearing
subcommittee.
Uh, must decide by a majority
vote.
Whether based solely on this one
incident.
In the words of the policy,
whether a preponderance of the
evidence supports that Senator
Stewart Stewart has committed an
offense that justifies the
imposition of sanctions. That's
a quote from the policy itself.
If the voters in the
affirmative, we then would
proceed to what recommendation
to make.
Regarding sanction if the voters
in the negative, it would end
there.
Um
Importantly, to note the
underlying facts in this matter
are not in dispute.
And there will be no evidence.
Whether in person or documentary
or any other fashion.
Uh, the, the facts are laid out
in the investigative report.
By Miss Wiggins, and so the only
matter we will concern, we will
consider ourselves with today is
What to do about it, if
anything.
Um
We will proceed and then after I
wrap up here, we'll proceed to
arguments of counsel.
Uh, which will begin with Ms.
Wiggins.
Author of the investigative
report, uh, any response
thereafter from senators, uh,
Mimi Stewart or her counsel and
her choice.
And rebuttal if any on the part
of Miss Wiggins.
Um
How much time do we have 15?
30 minutes
I'll make a personal request.
Please don't take all that time.
Because we're not talking about
facts here and so forth. Be as
brief as you can.
Uh, since the facts are not in
dispute.
Uh, at the end of the arguments,
Uh, this subcommittee will go
into closed session.
Uh, to deliberate and decide on
what recommended what
recommendation to make, if any.
To the Senate standing.
A committee
Uh, the subcommittee will issue
a written formal order.
In the near future
Which will be public
Uh, in due course.
Um
And after, after we
Proceed with this part of it,
we'll go on recess and then go
into
Close the session.
I think we're ready to proceed,
Ms. Wiggins.
You can proceed from there.
Yes, thank you, Your Honor. I
appreciate that. I would ask for
one point of clarification. I
understood that my charge today
was
With some context as to my role
to present a summary of the
findings.
Even though no testimony is
being taken today, I think that
a brief summary of the
information and factual basis
may be helpful to those who are
considering the matter, and if I
may, I would proceed with that.
I think so. Please proceed on
that now. Thank you.
As I mentioned earlier, I'm
Lorna Wiggins. I'm a labor and
employment lawyer who practices
with the firm of Wiggins,
Williams and Wetzenberg in
Albuquerque, New Mexico. Excuse

Justice Boston, can you all hear

OK
Alright, it appears I have
joined you now, finally. Senator
Sherris.
Entered the make an appearance
for the record.
And you are present. All right,
uh,
We've had the introduction of
counsel, Senator.
Uh, I made a few opening remarks
just by way of introduction.
Um, and we just began.
With a presentation by
Uh, Attorney Laura Wiggins.
Um
And she just started and then
hasn't gone any, any.
Further than that, I would note,
uh, attorney, uh Ms. Wiggins
that
Your investigative report has
been circulated.
To the full committee
I'm sure they've reviewed it in
Detail
And um
So just keep that in mind.
Thank you, Your Honor. I will.
As I noted, I served as special
counsel who conducted the
investigation into allegations
regarding an incident between
Senator Stewart and an employee
of the legislative council
service. The investigation
outcome was initially reported
to the investigative
subcommittee composed of Senator
Wood and Senator Stefaniks.
Counsel to that subcommittee was
Miss Christie Carbon Gau, who
served as its chair and as Your
Honor noted, the subcommittee
received my investigation report
and accepted it, and I would now
like to summarize briefly the uh
facts as determined in that
report. On Friday, February
28th.
2025, the reporting party who I
mentioned is a member of the
legislative council service
staff and serves as the capital
outlay programs coordinator made
a report of harassment following
an incident that occurred on
Thursday, February 27th, 2025
with Senator Stewart.
The reporting party indicated
that she emailed Senator Stewart
and Senator Stewart's secretary
for SD 17.
Sometime after 5 p.m. that day,
stating that she had not yet
received Senator Stewart's
capital outlay funding sheet and
asking if the senator or her
staff needed anything additional
from her office to complete the
sheet.
In response, the reporting party
stated that she almost
immediately received what she
deemed a screaming quote unquote
email in all capital letters
from Senator Stewart saying that
Senator Stewart had in fact
turned the sheet in on
Wednesday, the day before
February 26th at 3:30.
Senator Stewart copied that
email to her chief of staff,
Sanders Moore, and to her
secretary. Moments later, the
reporting party stated she
received a call from Senator
Stewart, screaming at her, using
what she deemed pejorative
language, including calling her
stupid for not knowing that the
sheet had already been turned
in. The reporting party also
indicated that Senator Stewart
screamed.
the following at her, Fatima
Guterres, write it down. Fatima
Guterres, write it down. Fatima
Guterres, write it down.
She also screamed, quote, Elaine
Swazzo Miller is no longer
working for her, end quote.
The reporting party told Senator
Stewart that she was sorry if
she had missed an email
containing the funding sheet.
At about the same time, the
reporting party received an
email with a copy of the funding
sheet.
She further stated that the
Verbal attack by Senator Stewart
had affected her mental and
physical well-being that she was
unable to sleep and that she
called in the next day
requesting sick leave.
She also reported that she was
not able to work that Sunday and
that weekend rather until Sunday
because she was still angry and
upset at the interaction with
Senator Stewart.
Turning now to my interview with
Senator Stewart. Senator Stewart
does recall that she received a
call from the reporting party in
the evening.
And the reporting party told her
that she did not have Senator
Stewart's funding sheets.
Senator Stewart stated that in
retrospect she did yell at the
reporting party, and Senator
Stewart admitted that she used
an angry tone during the call.
During my interview, Senator
Stewart did not initially
remember exactly what was said
during the conversation, but
She did acknowledge that she may
have used a word such as stupid
during the call.
And she may have emailed the
reporting party using all
capital letters.
After I provided a copy of the
email to Senator Stewart using
all capital letters, Senator
Stewart Stewart did say that yes
indeed she had sent that email,
and she agreed that using all
capital letters is the
equivalent of yelling at
someone.
Senator Stewart explained that
she was not going to question
any of the recollections of the
reporting party and expressed
her upset and her disappointment
in herself at taking her anger
out at the reporting party.
She told me that she had since
apologized via email to the
reporting party.
As a part of my work as special
counsel, I next analyzed whether
the anti-harassment policy that
Your Honor has mentioned today
applies to the specific facts
that I have just summarized, and
I'm prepared, Your Honor, to
address that briefly should this
subcommittee so desire.
Well
I think he should address that.
Yes. Thank you.
Thank you.
The legislator's anti-harassment
policy provides that it's the
policy of the legislature that
all persons who work for the
legislature, be able to do so in
an environment in which they are
treated with dignity and respect
and free from all forms of
harassment or discrimination.
The harassment portion of the
policy doesn't limit the conduct
to only discrimination that is
based on someone's protected
characteristic, such as race or
religion, sex, or something else
such as nationality. Instead,
the policy in place provides
that harassment and I am quoting
now, generally involves conduct,
comment, or display that a
reasonable person would find.
insulting, intimidating,
humiliating, hurtful, demeaning,
degrading, or that causes
offense, discomfort, or personal
humiliation or embarrassment to
a person or persons.
I concluded that conduct such as
what I have summarized would
fall within the anti-harassment
policy, even if I did not find
that such conduct was based on
the reporting parties, gender,
race, religion, or other
protected characteristic.
I also looked at whether the
ethics policy that is in place
for the legislature was arguably
relevant to the facts in this
matter.
And I will note that the Senate
rule on ethics at Section A
provides that members of the
Senate shall conduct themselves
in a manner that justifies the
confidence placed in them by the
people. The members shall not
use their offices for private
gain and shall at all times
maintain the integrity and
discharge ethically the high
responsibility of their
legislative positions. I
concluded after an
analysis of the ethics rule that
the conduct at issue here does
not fall within the purview of
this policy.
I believe as a result, as
special counsel, that the only
issue at play in this matter is
the anti-harassment policy that
I previously quoted.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Um, I'll open it up to questions
if if this committee members
have any, I have one question
for you, Ms. Wiggins.
The Anti-harassment policy.
Says a lot of things, but among
them is
harassment does not include
conduct such as heated
discussion.
It also says harassment can be a
single serious incident or a
series of incidents over time.
There's no allegation here of a
series of incidents. So why, in
your view, is this a serious
Incident
Two questions there.
Yes, and if I may, I'll address
your first question, and I will
note, Your Honor, that the
paragraph that you're
referencing in the
anti-harassment policy provides
under the Constitution of New
Mexico, legal action generally
cannot be taken against members.
Of the legislator for their
legislative acts, the sentence
regarding harassment, which does
not include heated discussions,
pointed questioning, and a
vigorous attempts to persuade,
applies to members of the
legislature, not members'
conduct directed towards
employees of the legislature.
As to your second question, Your
Honor, as to whether this is
serious conduct.
The seriousness of the conduct
must be judged based in part on
how the person on the receiving
and perceived it, and as I've
mentioned, it was severe enough
that the reporting party was
emotionally upset and was
required to take sick time, was
unable to perform her duties
until Sunday of that weekend
during a very busy time of
the legislature. It is
irrelevant and employment
matters involving harassment and
discrimination as to the intent
of the speaker, the relevant
issue for those who are judging
the facts is how it impacted the
recipient of such conduct.
So for those reasons, I believed
that it was sufficiently serious
as to warrant consideration by
this body.
This wig is to follow up.
There's also uh
An objective standard here too,
is there not? Would a reasonable
person regard this as a serious
incident, not just the
complaining witness, but a
reasonable person.
Yes, Your Honor, and in the
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals,
the standard in these cases
would be a reasonable woman
under the same or similar
situation and in this, and in
this case, I think that's the
reasonableness standard judged
from the perspective of a woman,
also a woman in an unequal
position of authority and
responsibility.
Thank you. I'll open up to the
floor, uh.
Any questions from the Senate
members of the subcommittee.
Senator Townsend
Yes, Justice, uh, Ms. Wiggins.
Based on um your commentary.
Do you believe that a person
working in the legislature who
might have yelled.
And, and were screamed at a
legislator would be viewed
differently than a legislator
doing the exact same
reciprocally.
Yes, sir, I do. And Senator, let
me explain why, as I mentioned a
moment ago when there is a
disparity in the power
relationship between the
individuals involved.
That is something that a finder
of fact can take into
consideration.
So yes, I agree that would be a
different situation.
Any questions from any other
senators, members?
Raise your hand if you have
questions.
Otherwise we'll proceed to Mr.
Vargas.
See none. Mr. Vargas, uh, you're
representing Senator Stewart
here.
Yes, Justice.
Thank you is yours.
Thank you, sir. Madam Zoom
operator, am I allowed to share
screen?
Uh, if the chair is fine with
that. I can enable those
permissions.
I see no reason why not, yeah.
OK.
Thank you.
Um, I want to start by pointing
out that
As you point out, Justice
Boston, this did not involve a
serious incident.
And that is in fact required.
Um, there is nothing under the
policy that separates this, the
sentence that you mentioned from
complaints between legislators
versus complaints by employees
against legislators.
But really what we're talking
about here is an interaction
between Senator Stewart and Ms.
Jasky that occurred on February
27th.
It was an unfortunate
interaction.
Senator Stewart in a high-stress
moment, lost her cool, and she
was impolite to Ms. Jasky.
No, she wasn't just impolite.
She was downright rude.
What she wasn't though.
was harassing her.
Certainly not under the way
harassment is defined under this
policy.
But before I get to that, I want
to give you a little bit of
context, context about the
events leading up to this
interaction.
February 26 was the deadline for
Senator Stewart to get her
capital outlay requests in.
And as you all know, this is a
very important part of the
legislative process. It provides
legislators such as yourselves,
the only opportunity to bring
funding directly to your
districts for schools, for
infrastructure, and any other
needs that your districts might
need or your constituents might
need. It's the only way to
direct benefits to your
constituents in an easy,
And straightforward manner.
And in this case, Senator
Stewart had approximately $4
million in capital outlay that
she was attempting to direct.
To her district.
Which is known as the
Albuquerque International
District.
But if we're being honest, it's
still called the war zone in
Albuquerque.
It's one of the poorest
districts in the state of New
Mexico.
And $4 million of capital outlay
is extremely important to this
impoverished district.
Senator Stewart and her staff
had worked for weeks on
providing the capital outlay
request.
He
Chief of staff and her executive
secretary collectively put in
between 20 and 30 hours working
just on the capital outlay
request.
Senator Stewart herself put in
10 to 15 hours.
Just working on the capital
outlay request.
And because of their hard work,
They were thrilled to have
completed it a couple of hours
early before the deadline.
They sighed a big sigh of relief
when they submitted it by 3:30
and it was due at 5 on the 26th.
So imagine Senator Stewart's
surprise when she received an
email more than a day after the
deadline.
Telling her that she had not
submitted her capital outlay
request.
She was beside herself.
She was upset because she knew
there's no way that was true.
So what did she do?
She fired off an email.
And I'm gonna share that exact
email with you right now if I
can.
That email is in the record,
counsel, just so you know it.
Thank you, thank you, Your
Honor.
I just want to make it clear so
that you all see it in real
time, that all it says is,
We sent it to you yesterday
afternoon around 3:30 from my
secretary, Fatima Gutierrez.
Period.
That's all that email says.
And there's been some
suggestion.
That because she used all caps
in that email, that that was
somehow offensive, or it was
yelling.
But if that's the case, if
that's what a
I'm sorry.
If that is the case.
The emails that include things
like this.
This meeting started at 1:30 in
all caps.
would be considered yelling.
An email that said, have a nice
day.
would be considered yelling.
Her email is benign.
It clearly does not violate any
policy and certainly not the
anti-harassment policy. And I
know there were portions of it
read to you.
And I want to highlight those
portions because they're very
important when we get to
The definition
Because the definition makes it
abundantly clear.
That in order to be harassment.
It has to be a ver verbal or
physical behavior that a
reasonable person.
Not Miss Jasky, but a reasonable
person would find threatening.
Intimidating
Or coercive
Now, I know it was read to you
that harassment generally
involves conduct, comment, or
display that a reasonable person
would find insulting, etc. etc.
But all that is, is an example.
Of general example.
Of what could amount to
harassment, but using those
examples, you have to look at
the specific conduct, and see if
that specific conduct, in fact,
was threatening, intimidating,
or coercive, because this policy
makes it abundantly clear that
that is how we define
harassment. And if it does not
meet those standards.
Threatening, intimidating, or
coercive, there is no
harassment.
So to violate this policy, you
would have to find
That Senator Stewart's
interactions on February 27th
were threatening, meaning she
threatened.
Jasky
She said something that Miss
Jasy made her think, oh, she's
gonna do something to me. She's
threatening me.
Um, you would have to find
The senator's comments
intimidated her or made her
fearful.
Because that's what intimidation
is, or you would have to find
that the senator's comments were
coercive, trying to coerce her
into doing something she did not
want to do.
Nothing in that email meets
those definitions.
So let's talk about the
senator's next move.
As we know after that email, she
had an unfortunate phone call
with Miss Jasky.
And make no mistake,
Her comments in that phone call,
they were just rude.
They were heated
They were uncalled for.
But they weren't threatening,
intimidating, or coercive.
So what exactly did she say?
What did she say that
would give rise to
Sorry, I'm still trying to get
this going.
That would give rise to a claim
of harassment.
Well, the first thing that Miss
Jasy said, she said, and
remember, she doesn't recall
saying it, but she says that the
senator said, I turned the sheet
in. How could you be so stupid
not to know that.
Then she said
Fatima Gutierrez, write it down.
Fata McG Guterres, write it
down.
Fatima Gutierrez, write it down.
And finally
She said, Elaine Swazo Miller no
longer works for me.
That is the sum total of the
interaction.
That is everything that she
allegedly said to Ms. Jasky.
And as I said before,
His comments weren't nice.
They were rude
The senator admits she raised
her voice.
But they don't amount to
harassment.
These were simply.
Comments of a frustrated
legislator in a heated moment
during a very important and
stressful part of the
legislative process. This was
smack dab in the middle of a
60-day session, and it followed
weeks of work on getting that
capital outlay request done and
done before the deadline.
It was a heated discussion about
an important legislative
deadline, and nothing more.
And as just as Boston pointed
out,
The policy itself tells us
That is not harassment.
It specifically says harassment
does not include conduct, such
as heated discussions pointed
questioning and rigorous
attempts to persuade, which is
generally accepted as a regular
and necessary part of the
legislative process and make no
mistake. There is nothing in
this policy that cabins that.
To just complaints between
legislators. It applies to the
entire harassment policy.
Again, there was nothing
threatening.
Intimidating or coercive about
the comments that the senator
made.
She never threatened Miss Jasky.
Ms. Jasky never reported feeling
threatened, intimidated, or
coerced. In fact, if we look at
what Ms. Jasky said.
About how she felt.
Following that interaction.
Here's what we see.
She felt she mishandled the
call.
That's her statement in the
report.
She felt regret that she wasn't
stronger.
In, in responding to the
senator.
She didn't feel she could be at
work because she was angry.
You heard Ms. Wiggins use that
word. She was angry.
But she wasn't
But she wasn't, she wasn't
threatened.
She wasn't intimidated.
And she never said I was coerced
or she tried to get me to do
something I didn't want to do.
None of the things that are
required.
To meet the standard for
harassment.
Wherever mentioned by Ms. Jasy
as to how she felt.
Or how she received
The senator's interaction.
Now Senator Stewart is not proud
of her conduct on February
twenty-seventh, and she's
expressed directly to Ms. Jasky
in an email that she's
profoundly sorry.
For treating her the way she
did.
She strives to do better all the
time.
In fact, as soon as Senator
Stewart found out that Ms. Jaske
was upset,
She felt awful, and she
immediately sent an email of
apology.
She sent it in the middle of the
night. It was weighing on her so
much.
And she has stated more than
once, including in the
investigative report that she
really hopes that Ms. Jaske can
find it in her heart to accept
her apology.
In fact, the senator feels so
badly about it. She's asked me
to read a brief statement to
you.
And this is a statement from
Senator Stewart.
I believe it's important that we
legislators treat everyone with
kindness and respect, especially
our staff.
During the legislative session,
when all of us are rushed under
pressure, and tempers can flare.
It's even more important to
exhibit calmness and kindness.
I regret that I failed to do
that with Michelle.
When I was informed of her
reaction, I sent her a letter of
apology.
I stand by that apology.
I plan to continue to monitor my
reactions to others.
I'm seeing a mental health
counselor now to ensure my
kindness and respect for others
is on solid footing.
And I'm committed to always
learning from others and growing
in my ability to help others.
Now, at the end of the day,
Justice Boston, senators.
What we have is a situation
where Senator Stewart in a
high-stress moment during an
important part of the
legislative process.
Lost her cool.
She lost her cool, and she
wasn't nice.
She raised her voice.
But she didn't harass anyone,
and she certainly didn't violate
the legislature's
anti-harassment policy.
Now, obviously, Senator Stewart
hopes
She'll never have a repeat of
what happened on February 27th.
And she hopes that her future
interactions with staff are more
amicable and productive.
She's working towards that.
And your decision today will
have far-reaching implications
for how people comport
themselves at the legislature
going forward.
Because if Senator Stewart's
conduct on February 27th amounts
to a violation of the
anti-harassment policy.
Then the interactions between
legislators and staff will not
be amicable or productive
because everyone in the
roundhouse will be walking on
eggshells.
Everyone will be afraid to say
the wrong thing.
Or afraid that if their
passionate about a subject,
It's gonna get confused for
harassment.
It will stifle the legislative
process and discourage
passionate discussion about
important policy issues.
That the legislature tackles
every year.
Senator Stewart lost her cool on
February 27th.
And she's very sorry for that.
But that's all this amounts to.
She did not harass Miss Jasky.
And for these reasons, we
respectfully request that you
dismiss the complaint against
her. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Vargas. I'm going
to ask you one question then
I'll open up to the rest of the
committee.
The Policy also uh
Says harassment generally
involves conduct.
a reasonable person would find
insulting.
Humiliating
Here demeaning or degrading.
Or that causes
Offense
Why, why is, uh, calling someone
stupid, why it doesn't that rise
to this level?
Well
To be fair, Justice Boston.
That is just a gen those are
general examples of conduct that
can be considered harassment.
But you have to view those
specific instances of conduct
through the lens of the
definition.
Of harassment
And the definition requires a
reasonable person to be
threatened, intimidating, or
coerced.
And, and if you, if you
See that it, what you read to me
starts out with harassment
generally involves.
That's merely a general
statement of examples. Um, if
you ask me, is calling someone
stupid, insulting. Yeah, it
probably generally is.
But it doesn't meet the
definition of harassment as the
legislature has defined it in
this policy.
One more question. Would you
agree with the proposition that
the Senate has an obligation to
protect and respect its
employees.
Absolutely, and Senator Stewart
agrees with that as well, and
that's, as I mentioned, why,
among other things, she's
seeking help and working on
herself, because she doesn't
want a repeat of this.
All right, I'll open it up to
the floor. Anyone have any?
Questions, follow up.
Anything else looking around the
screen, I don't see any hands
raised.
Uh, just as my hand is up. This
is Senator Hamblin.
You're all, oh, there you are up
in the corner. I'm sorry.
Apologies.
Um, if Mr. Vargas can kind of uh
maybe clarify because um if I'm
correct on the, the timeline of
events, there was the original
email and then there was the
phone call.
So there were 22 instances.
Where, um, the pro tem displayed
some behavior that, that she now
regrets and has expressed that
uh thoroughly.
The 2 instances.
Cause, uh, is that a
justification for harassment
because it's more than one time.
And I'm just wondering if you
can kind of clarify that for me.
With all due respect, Senator, I
don't think we can consider the
email to be harassment. Uh, we
looked at it, all it said was, I
sent it to you yesterday at 3:30
from Fatima Rodriguez.
Period.
There's nothing insulting,
intimidating.
And to consider that as part of
a cumulative effect to say that
it's a series of, of things that
are harassing would be to
concede that sending a benign
email that merely states a fact.
is harassing.
And I, I'm just not prepared to
concede that at this time.
OK, and we may, we may disagree
on the use of all caps as not
being acceptable as yelling, but
I think given how long we've
been using email, um, that is
kind of an unspoken
Understanding of that. So, um, I
think that's interesting that
That would be perceived as
yelling as the pro tem has
acknowledged when using all
caps.
And so I just, I, I was just
hoping for clarification on
whether or not you feel 2 times
uh of that is considered that is
not considered harassment, um,
and for this committee to
consider. And if you're asking
me is, is there a magic number
that we can say?
Comprises a series, I would say
that 2 would not comprise a
series. It would probably
require more than that.
Um, and I understand our
disagreement on the use of all
caps, but I think
Even if you are yelling when
you're yelling, I sent it to you
at 3:30.
It's not
Threatening, intimidating, or
coercive.
OK, thank you for that. Thank
you for that clarification. I
appreciate that. Any further
questions?
Comments
Yes,
Senator Sheriff.
So, uh, just one quick question,
I think for Mr. Vargas, uh, uh,
Mr. Justice.
Um
Is this conduct something that
that is acceptable in your
opinion, uh, for legislators,
uh, directed towards staff.
Um, absolutely not. I think
every legislator should strive
to do better and not treat staff
that way, um, and, and we've
conceded that and Senator
Stewart as, as much as said it
and apologized for it, but
again, the decision today is the
question of whether it meets the
definition of harassment, which
clearly does not.
OK, thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Senator. Anybody
else?
Looking at the screen,
Uh, one follow up question, Mr.
Vargas.
Uh, did, did your client didn't
Senator Stewart, did she not
concede?
In discussions
With
Attorney Wiggins
That capitals amounted to
yellow. She conceded that that
could be perceived that way,
yes.
Thank you.
OK, anyone else?
All right. Thank you, counsel.
Miss Wiggins, if you have any
brief follow up floor is yours.
Yes, thank you, Your Honor, very
briefly, uh, Mr. Vargas has
defined harassment in a fashion
that most suits his argument.
That, however, is not what the
plain language of the
anti-harassment policy says,
first of all, we do have to
remember that it is the purpose
of this policy to ensure that
employees, not fellow members,
but employees of the legislature
are treated with dignity and
respect.
The policy specifically
recognizes that members may
engage in vigorous debate, and
sometimes may engage in
Unfortunate conduct to push
their beliefs, their agenda, and
achieve their legislative
accomplishments. That's not what
happened here. What happened
here was conduct that was in
fact viewed reasonably by the
recipient as hurtful, demeaning,
caused her discomfort.
It is absolutely within a
reasonable definition and using
the reasonable woman's standard
to conclude that it was
humiliating, intimidating, and
insulting.
In addition, I would point out
that in fact Senator Stewart
admitted using all caps is
equivalent.
And she did not hedge that in
any way, and I respect her for
acknowledging that.
The words that she used have to
be considered in this conduct,
not words such as all caps, the
meeting will start at 1:30. You
have to consider these two acts
in concert and taken together,
those acts we believe are
And
No question.
Hurtful, demeaning, cause
discomfort, and frankly, should
not be countenanced by this
body.
Thank you, Your Honor.
All right. Um,
Any questions of Ms. Wiggins?
And members, no.
All right then, uh,
I think that means that we are
now
In recess
And we will move into closed
session.
Uh, to deliberate and decide
where to go.
From here
So now we get to the technical
aspect.
Of going into closed session.
I'm not sure how that's done.
like
That Mr.
Go ahead.
There could be a new link.
For us to go into closed
session.
That's what I'm told. So
Justice, I, I believe someone
has to move that we go into
closed session and therefore I
will make that motion.
5 seconds, that's right.
So second
A second,
Bobby seconds discussion.
All in favor, say I. Uh.
Anybody posted?
All right,
The motion passes. We'll go into
close.
Session. And I think another
link is being sent to all of us.
Thank you, counsel.
Wiggins, Mr. Vargas, thank you
for your arguments. Thank you,
Justice. Thank you, senators.
Thank you very much, very
helpful. Thank you.
