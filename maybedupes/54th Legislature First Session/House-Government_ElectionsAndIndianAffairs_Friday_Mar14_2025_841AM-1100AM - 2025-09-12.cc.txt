Committee meeting to order.
Please call roll.
Representative Representative
block, present Representative
Borego,
Representative Lujan.
Representative Mejia here, Madam
floor leaders representative
Zamora.
Madam Vice Chair.
Madam Chair.
Here, Madam Chair.
Madam Chair, we have a quorum.
Thank you. We have a quorum and
uh a little housekeeping
announcement before we begin.
We're going to move Senate Bill
299 as amended to the top of the
agenda this morning. We'll hear
that first. And then we will
have to consent, uh, bills
Senate Bill 31 and Senate Bill
41, and we'll uh talk about that
when we.
get to that point. So with that,
a senator.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members,
and Senate Bill 299 was actually
borne out of personal
experience, um,
Currently, well, let me back up
in in 1919, the current law was
um put into place and that just
states that, uh, legislators are
to notify the Secretary of State
when they vacate their seat.
But there were no directions
after that, and that's when they
were like taking horse and buggy
up up here to Santa Fe to
notify, um, and times have
changed. So the Secretary of
State and I had um a few
conversations and people in her
office about how she'll get
random emails even to her
personal Gmail sometimes when
someone, um, is vacating their
seat and she may not know it for
days. So we decided also based
on my experience, which was my
district.
21 without a senator for an
entire quarter of the year.
Which is not in the best
interest of the constituents,
and that's because that senator
had vacated his seat early and
told the Secretary of State, but
since there's no other
requirement. That's all that was
done. And so the Secretary of
State currently um is not
required to notify the county
commission or commissions when
they are notified. So there's no
action, no accountability. So
what we did is we drafted this
actually several senators
weighed in on this through
committees.
And you are seeing the final
version, which is not only does
that legislator need to um
notify the Secretary of State,
the Secretary of State within um
5 days, will then notify the
appropriate county or county
commissions, um, so that
everyone knows right away so
they can start their process for
their county. And that's it.
I'll stand for questions.
Thank you. We'll go to the
audience, those in favor, please
raise your hands.
Those in opposition.
And let's go on the line real
quick. Anyone hoping to speak in
opposition to the bill, please
raise your hand or anyone hoping
to speak in favor of the bill,
please raise your hand.
Signature.
You, Madam Vice Chair Little.
I'm happy to move a do pass on
this bill.
Representative Zamora.
Did you wanna
No, I was just OK. We're good.
OK. We have a motion by
Representative Vice Chair Little
for DuP pass the second by a
representative block. Is there
any opposition?
Thank you, Madam Chair and
members.
All right, let's hear House Bill
292.
Senator and Representative.
Anytime.
Thank you so much, Madam Chair
and members of the committee.
Good morning. It's an honor to
be here again after my
introductory remarks, Senator
Scott, Todd Randall.
Online, who is the assistant
city manager of Hobbs and Toby
Spears online from Hobbs is the
finance director, and they'll
take over after me.
Before you is House Bill 292. In
simple terms, this bill seeks to
transfer a portion of the gross
receipts tax revenue.
Two municipalities and counties.
So what happened with HB 6 back
in 2019, it moved gross receipt
taxes to the location of the
service rather than the location
of the business. So what this
did was it moved oil and gas,
GRT revenue away from
municipalities and gave it to
the state. The unintended
consequences resulted in an
estimated annual loss of 10 to
$20 million.
to oil producing municipalities
like Hobbs and Carlsbad, and
that's where I live in Hobbs. So
this move was part of a larger
tax bill that was presented. And
to my knowledge, the impacts
were not readily clear to our
local legislators at that time.
So this bill would be a solution
to those unintended
consequences. Um, Madam Chair
and members of the committee,
I'd like to turn it over now to
Senator Larry Scott.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Members
of the committee, good morning.

We support a system that fairly

Across the entire state.
Thank you so much.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. I'm
Alison Nichols with the New
Mexico Municipal League. Uh, we
think the sponsors for bringing
this bill, as I mentioned, the
state has seen record oil and
gas revenues, but cities and
counties largely don't receive
the benefits of, of these um
economic boom, so we really
appreciate the sponsors, um,
bringing forth the concept of
investing these revenues in our
communities and supporting um
services in our communities.
Thank you.
Thank you. Anyone else who
wishes to speak and support.
Let's go online for supporting
comments. One minute. Anyone
hoping to speak in support of
the bill, please raise your
hand.
OK, we have a Rebecca Hammer.
Rebecca, can you hear us?
Can you hear me?
I'm afraid not, Rebecca. I'm
gonna you go ahead and try and
mute yourself, maybe that'll fix
it.
We're gonna move on, uh, Bill,
Bill Lee from
appears.
I'm sorry, Bill, we're having a
hard time hearing you again.
Go to the audience for those who
wish to speak in opposition.
Seeing um.
Come back to public comment if
we need to uh committee member.
Wuhan.
Madam chair, um, thank you to
the sponsors for bringing this
forward. This has been an
ongoing, um,
ask if you will or issue that
we've been trying to resolve. I
said, um, I think that one of
the original, one of the task
force with the Senator Kernan at
the time, and we really tried
to, we put some fixes in through
the years, Madam Chair, but
they're, they've been band-aids
and so
I just want to ask a couple of
questions in, in the regard to
doing it this way, you know, I'm
reading what some of the FIR um
information here from um
TRD, um, I mean, it's not really
negative. I don't think, but it
How did we come to the 8%
manager gets my questions.
How's that formula like compared
to a lower amount.
your representative.
Yeah
it was.
Southeast
Somewhat whole.
the
Destination for change.
did not get there.
felt like it was important for
the entire state.
In a
From the soil and gas revenues.
So as a consequence, what we
ended up with
Or
Our community city farms.
We ended up with about $12
million.
But to get there, we distributed
throughout the state a little
over $300 million.
And the communities obviously
that contributed the most with
the highest population stood to
benefit more than smaller
communities, but
All communities got something,
uh Tatum.
$200,000 send home.
$200,000. These folks don't
participate at all in the oil
boom.
And but this gives them the
monies to to.
To buy a back code for the
cemetery or
For of
Needs that they may have that
they just don't have any revenue
stream to support right now.
Thank, thank you, Madam Chair
and thank you for that. I just
know that, so this, so this
formula, what you do now with
the the 30, 70 distribution is
because that's an additional,
um,
Way of of uh distributing this
this creates that balance that
we're looking for because I know
one of the issues was, and as
you've, you've mentioned, it was
a distribution across the entire
state.
But this then settles, um, the,
um.
The destination source issue
that was happening in, in your
part of the, the state, is that
correct?
up Madam Chair Representative,
it does not completely solve it,
but it certainly helps.
And if you don't mind, how, what
was, what would be the in
The
Just the distribution, um,
difference that you're not
receiving in, in that part of
this, in those parts of the
state, Madam Chair and
Representative of course the
formula, it is easy to adjust.
Both on the gross value side, if
you take 8%, you could go to 22,
Both on the gross value side, if
you take 8%, you could go to 2
takes.
At the other end of that
spectrum, you can adjust the
weighting factors to make.
The contribution.
coming to the state larger.
Say 35 or 40%.
And the per capita.
Distribution smaller.
So you could be a formula
adjustment.
Yet all the way to parody, for
example, in the city of Hobbes,
but it would take.
It would take some more, a
higher adjustment.
On the waiting factor for
contribution which would
necessarily
Uh
But per capita at a bit of a
disadvantage.
OK, so Madam Chair, my last
question, who would control
those adjustments. Local
government or the legislator
would still control those
adjustments. Adam.
Madam Chair and Representative.
Under the control of the
legislature. Thank you, madam.
Representative, let's go back
online, I believe.
There are a couple of people who
still wish to make public
comment.
Either in support or opposition.
All right, Rebecca, let's go
ahead and try again. Rebecca,
can you hear us?
I'm sorry, did you say that
Rebecca?
Uh, Bill, Bill Lee, do you want
to jump in?
Yes, it is. Can you hear me,
Madam Chair, members of the
committee we can but we're just
gonna turn the volume up a
little bit, one second.
All right. Go ahead, Bill.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee. I'll keep my
comments brief. My name is Bill
Lee, president, CEO of the
Gallup McKinley County Chamber
of Commerce, and we stand in
support of this legislation. We
think it's a a great way to
offset some of the uh
harm that has been done to
municipalities and counties
withhold harmless.
Legislation that took place a
number of years ago, so we stand
in support and take this, the
sponsors for bringing this
legislation and ask that you
give a due pass. Thank you,
Madam Chair, members of the
committee. Thank you so much,
Bill.
Right. Rebecca, can you hear us?
Rebecca
OK, we're gonna move on. Uh,
anyone hoping to speak in
opposition to the bill, please
raise your hand.
Seeing none, and then uh
do you wanna hear? Yeah, let's
see if Todd.
Randall, um.
Yeah, Todd, can you hear us?
Uh yes, I can. Thank you. Thank
you, Madam Chair, members
committee. Can you hear me?
Todd.
A perfect
Um, I'm in, I'm the assistant
city manager for the city of
Hobbs and just want to speak
briefly to it and Larry Scott
did a great job. As far as the
creation of this fund will
provide critical financial
resources for local governments
to address community needs to
improve public service and
foster economic growth.
As stated due to the shift in
GRT distribution from business
location to destination base,
the city you have to experience
a 3% reduction in revenue.
In response, we've been forced
to implement new strategies to
maintain services, including
difficult decisions to cut 88
full-time positions, which
represents about 15% of the
workforce.
And I should point out and uh
Senator Scott did a good job.
Again, this bill is structured
to provide equitable
distribution recognizing that
both communities and counties
play a vital role to overall
success of our state.
Uh, we do support this bill.
Um, just to give you another
example, as far as because URT
is such a huge factor for
Malies. We'd actually extend
utilities out to oil and gas
industries, so it became inside
corporate boundaries so that we
would see that GRT.
With the shift in destination to
destination, uh, we lost that
revenue. In fact,
We lost that red in an even
state revenues gained an
additional 30% because the
state's share municipalities,
was now kept with by the state.
What this did is those
communities are still based,
employees are still based, the
services that we provide, the
infrastructure within our
community has suffered and with
the reduction.
So we stand in support of this
and would be available for any
questions.
OK, thank you. Back to committee
members.
Representative Brego.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and uh,
thank you, Senator and
Representative. I sat on tax
when this came, uh, or an idea
similar to this came forward,
um, I was just wondering, um,
With regard to this particular
bill, because it looks like it's
a little different than what we
talked about like 2 years ago, I
think, um, and I, it's the same
general concept.
Um
With regard to sustainability of
this fund, um,
I kind of have questions about
that because our revenues will
change over time, uh, with
regard to oil and gas, and I'm
just wondering.
How is this fund gonna be
sustainable?
Madam Madam Chair and
Representative is only a
sustainable as our GRT
collections.
But the beauty of the formula is
it will automatically adjust to
both increases and declines in
that revenue stream.
Because what we're capturing is
a fixed percentage of the number
that's coming into the state.
But
We really can't.
We can't do anything to address
the volatility of GRT, which I
think everyone recognizes is not
the stablest of ours.
And Madam Chair and Senator
Representatives, so this is
based on our gross receipts tax,
and I know there's been talk
about moving away from gross
receipts tax, so I'm just
wondering what your thoughts are
with regards to that.
Again, Madam Chair and
Representative as a fixed
percentage of the collections,
anything we do to alter those
collections will alter
automatically the distribution.
So what we do here with respect
to
Changes in GRT would
automatically modify those
distributions going back out to
communities.
Madam Chair, uh, senator and
Representative, and this is.
has yet to be heard by attacks.
Again.
I think.
Madam Chair Representative, and
that would be next if it is
passed in this committee.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair.
Representatives and excuse me,
com community members.
Representative Zamora,
I do.
2.
You have a motion for a do pass
by representative Zamora, a
second by
by Vice Chair Little before we
call roll.
Thank you, thank you for
bringing this bill forward. I
can appreciate, uh, uh, the
intent behind this. Uh, one of
the issues that was brought up
that has been raised.
We're, uh, what has to do with
the uh indigenous nations, um,
who do have a tax sharing uh
agreement with the state and
local governments, but I'm just
wondering if they were
considered as well, uh, there.
Um
Not included in this one. Can
you tell me why, how, uh, or
whether they will be considered
in the distribution of this.
This formula.
Of this, uh, of the
distribution. Thank you.
Madam Chair, Madam Chair.
Vice chair
Madam chair last chair.
That first division.
Of that 8%.
Goes out to 33 counties.
So to the extent that those
tribal communities are located
within those counties they
would.
Certainly be participating in
those revenues and that
participation would at that
point be on a per capita basis.
Thank you very much for that
information.
Um, I appreciate that. And, uh,
the follow-up question quickly.
Uh, were they also consulted in
the drafting or the proposed
bill.
Uh, Madame Chair.
I don't recall having any
specific consultations with
tribal communities, uh, most of
that formula uh development was
done by uh legislative council.
Thank you very much. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
OK. Thank you. We have a motion
for do pass and a second, please
call Roll.
Representative Nordin.
Representative Block.
Yes.

Representative Waa Nonu.
Representative Borego.
Yes, and I'd like to explain my
vote.
Madam Vice Chair.
Yes.
Madam Chair.
Yes.
Madam chaired by a vote of 9 to
9 to none. We, the motion
passes.
And representative Brego to
explain your vote. Thank you,
Madam Chair, and, and, uh,
senator and a representative,
uh, senator, we have a little
bit of history on this one, and
I just wanted to ensure that um,
You know,
All of the counties and
municipalities are being treated
equally, um, and especially in
our, in our discussions a couple
of years ago, we talked about
especially those communities
that are very low income.
So I just wanted to ensure, uh,
Madam Chair and and Senator and
Representative that those issues
are taken into consideration.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator and
Representative. You have a duty.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
members of the committee.
Thank you committee members, and
I see uh.
Let's move to Senate Bill 85 as
amended. I see Senator Wirth.
Good morning. Good morning,
Madam Chair. Um,
Senator Bergmans, he's also on
this bill is juggling committees
and Lindsay Bachmann, who's the
witness may be on Zoom, but
we're happy to present it, uh,
Senate Bill 85 does two things.
First, it amends.
portions of the campaign
Reporting Act that regulate
independent expenditure packs
known as super PACs. Uh, this is
the continuation of work we've
been doing.
Since 2010, quite frankly, when
the United States Supreme Court
and Citizens United created this
new group known as an
independent expenditure with no
limits. The one thing the
Supreme Court said we could do
is require disclosure of donors,
and so this has been an ongoing
effort to
Go as far as we can up against
the limits of the First
Amendment.
Uh, the second thing this bill
does is change a few uh portions
of a candidate's reporting
requirements. Uh, so I think the
best thing for me to do is just
walk you through the different
sections of the bill one by one
and what they do.
Uh, section one is a
definitional change, um, to the
definition of expenditure, there
is a very limited window when we
can require disclosure of
independent expenditures and
that's actually an existing
language on page 7, line 13, uh,
so basically there's a, when a
when a
Flyer, um, expressly advocates
for or against a candidate
that's published by an
independent expenditure
committee that donors have to be
disclosed, or there are windows
before a general and primary
election when under the court
law, those donations have to be
closed. Uh, the new language in
section P is designed because
basically there was some
ambiguity there that was
resulting in certain things not
being
classified as expenditures, so
it's just an attempt to tighten
this up, uh, and make sure that
we get disclosure when
disclosure is required. Uh,
section 2, deals with electronic
communications, uh, when this
section of the law was put in
place, it dealt with telephone
calls, uh, and this basically is
when you have to disclose where
the telephone call comes from,
while the world has changed as
we all know, so we're, we're now
changing that to electronic
communication. So if it's a text
message.
Um, that would be a perfect
example that you should have a
disclosure on that text message.
Uh, section 3, applies again to
independent expenditures, and
this deals with primarily with
the creation of an independent
segregated bank account. So,
The situation comes up when you
have independent expenditures
that are raising money from a
variety of different donors, uh,
and then
Determining which of those funds
are used for the actual
independent expenditures. So
donors, what's what happened in
some case law in front of the
ethics commission is donors had
basically said that they didn't
want that their fund to be used
for independent expenditures,
but it wasn't put in a
segregated bank account, and as
a result of that, there was a
loophole here, uh, which led to
a whole bunch of litigation uh
with the independent ethics
Commission and through court,
uh, what this bill does.
is clarify, um, on page 14, um,
exactly how to make sure those
donations get put into a
segregated bank account so that
when a donor uh is very clear
that they do not want their
donation to fund an independent
expenditure, uh, it's put into
that account and, and it's clear
that that's what's gonna happen
there.
Uh, section 4 amends the
reporting schedule for
candidates for office, uh, right
now when legislators are not
running for office, we have to
file two biannual reports in the
off year, uh, those reports are
due currently in very random
months of April and October. Uh,
this First Amendment, uh, sets
the reporting dates for biennial
reports to something that makes
more sense. One is due in June
and
The 2nd 1 is due in December.
Uh, the next amendment in
section 4 clarifies that if a
reporting date falls on a state
holiday, then the report is due
the next business day.
Uh, the next amendment deals
with supplemental reports that
were required to make after
election day, uh, the amount it
specifies the amount that needs
to be reported is anything
that's $1000 or more right now
it reads more than $1000 so
technically $1000 check would
not need to be reported. Just
clarify, so $1000 check does
need to be reported. It also
clarifies that both
contributions and expenditures
are required on supplemental
reports, which is how the system
is
is working, but the statute just
didn't track that.
Uh, the next amendment states
that if you lose your primary,
you have to file the final
report 7 days after the election
and instead of the 13 day kind
of randomly selected time that's
in the statute now. It also
changes the end of the reporting
period to the primary election
day rather than the day 25 days
after the primary, um.
And so that's what that does.
The next amendment is a similar
schedule chain to the general
election period. The reporting
period will end on the date of
the election rather than
December 31st, and then it's due
and must be filed 7 days after
that, right now after a general
election, we don't file the
final report until December
31st. That doesn't make any
sense. Uh, so basically this
will say the time period will
stop once the election is done
and you've got 7 days to file
the report.
Um, subsection C creates a new
report.
It says if you receive money
during the prohibited period,
you must file reports 7 days
after that prohibited period
ends, uh, 7 days after the
session ends, and remember we
can receive unsolicited
contributions during this
window, uh, and so this is to
address that situation.
Uh, the deletion of subsection G
in section 4 cleans up what PACs
who are not spending money can
do right now, the PA still has a
bank account with contributions
that solicited, uh, the statute
said it can cancel its
registration with the Secretary
of State. If it is not spent
that money or receive new money
uh over a period of one year by
deleting G, we're requiring
packs to continue to stay
registered with the Secretary of
State as long as there's a bank
account open associated with
that.
back.
A section 5.
Uh, deals with regulates the use
of campaign funds. Uh, the First
Amendment on page 18, line 22.
Uh, we'll regulate the statewide
and district-wide races uh
cannot donate to federal
candidates or municipal
candidates. Again, this is a
cleanup, uh, but a policy
change, a subsection B will
regulate that you cannot pay
back a loan that includes
interest, and this is an
important one. there was a
federal
case involving Senator Ted Cruz,
where he loaned himself a lot of
money and then
Raised a lot of campaign
contributions to pay himself
back a personal loan. Uh, you
cannot do that and we're
clarifying in this statute, this
is kind of a preemptive.
Um, attempt to address that
situation. Uh,
And so that's essentially what
section 6 does, and it also
requires that the terms of any
loan that a candidate makes to
the candidate's campaign
committee and evidence of any
loan that a candidate makes the
candidate's campaign committee
have to be listed. The reason
for that is you don't want
someone just listing that they
took a loan. We don't know if
that actually happened or not.
You want to make sure that
there's documented terms that
deal with that situation.
Uh,
section 6, is the disclosure we
talked about that for a loan and
then section 7 deals with the
legislative session prohibited
period. Uh, the First Amendment
clarifies who the prohibited
period refers to and also
expands that it regulates the
legislative caucus committees
cannot solicit contributions.
Those are recently created
entities, uh, and so we want to
make sure the same rules apply
to them that apply to all of us.
Second change on page 25, line
21, creates a new prohibition
that an incumbent candidate uh
cannot accept a contribution
during the prohibited period
from a lobbyist, lobbyist
employer, employer current
legislator, candidate, or PAC,
you still can receive an
unsolicited contribution from an
individual. You just have to
report it.
Uh, and then importantly,
section 27, the final thing on
line 9 changes how long the
prohibited period applies to the
governor and lieutenant governor
during a regular special or
extraordinary session, it
changes it to either the regular
21 days, which is what we're
used to after the session ends
or the next calendar day after
bills have been signed or vetoed
and sent to the Secretary of
State. You think about it, that
makes sense. If we have a
special session with one bill,
the governor signs the bill the
day we're done, should.
be a 21 day prohibited period.
So, um,
Madam Vice Chair and members of
the committee, uh, this bill is
a continuation of the.
bill that passed in
uh 200019 that finally closed
many of these loopholes, and
again, we've, there's a need to
do this to try to level the
playing field. Uh, we're dealing
with a situation where we all
work within confines about how
much we can accept, uh, and I
actually was involved in the
bill in 2009 that finally put
limits, uh, here in New Mexico,
uh, but then the Supreme Court
came along with Citizens United
and we have these
independent expenditures that
can, can raise unlimited amounts
and contributed unlimited
amounts, but at least the voters
should know where the money came
from. So that's what the bill
does, Madam Chair, and um again,
Lindsay Bachman is expert from
the Secretary of State. She may
be on the Zoom, I'm not sure,
um, but happy to stand for
questions.
Thank you, Senator. I just want
to let you know that the
calendar, uh, the bill is not
listed on the calendar online.
It is listed on our committee
calendar and then of course, um,
hard copy. So, um, that, that
might be a concern if we don't
have public comment, but we'll
see. So we'll move to public
comment now.
Do we have anyone in the
audience who would like to uh
make a comment in support. Let's
do one minute.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
committee members. I'm Molly
Swank and I'm the executive
director of Common Cause New
Mexico. SB 85 closes major
loopholes in New Mexico's
campaign Reporting Act and
overall increases the
transparency of who is trying to
influence elections in our
state. For too long, special
interest groups have been able
to function and sway elections
with high levels of anonymity
and because our organization
believes in ethical
accountability and transparency,
we believe the electorate
deserves to know who's playing
where. This bill does not intend
to impact advocacy
organizations.
who work on grassroots lobbying
or members membership
mobilization, but simply shine
light on large electoral
spenders.
Money in our elections has
increased dramatically and with
the threat of out of state and
even out of country spenders
trying to gain power through
electoral politics, SB 85 is a
necessary step to ensure public
confidence in our elections.
And though it clears up last
minute campaign efforts before
an election, so organizations
cannot hide behind unreported
ads, analysis finds that it does
not increase burden for
organizations to increase this
transparency. Thank you.
Do we have any further comments
and support?
OK, let's go online.
All right, we have Lindsay
Bachmann. Lindsay, can you hear
us?
I can. Good morning, committee
members. I hope to see you
shortly, but I just wanted to
thank the sponsor for bringing
this forward and yeah, it's an
important bill as to
transparency and the reporting
that entities do in the state,
and we appreciate you hearing it
this morning.
Alright. Thank you so much,
Lindsey. We'll see you in a
little bit. Uh, moving on, we
have Athena.
I hear?
And thank you, Chair, committee
members. My name is Athena
Christodoulou, and I have run
for office for several times,
and I appreciate the senator
bringing forth this bill and
clearing up some of the
loopholes. Um, I would ask
though if um to have make sure
it's clarified about filing day
after the campaign because many
campaigns have debt that they
might still be raising funds
for, so I'm not sure about how
that works, um.
But otherwise it's a, it's a
good bill. Thank you.
Thank you so much, Athena.
Moving on, we have Anna, Anna
Hansen, can you hear us?
Looks like we're having a little
trouble here hearing you,
Hannah, so I'm gonna mute you.
Go ahead and unmute yourself.
Hopefully that will fix it.
Let's try that one more time.
So sorry there Anna. Looks like
we won't be able to hear you.
Um, let's go ahead and move on.
Is there anyone here hoping to
speak in opposition to the bill.
Please raise your hand now.
Seeing none.
It looks like we have one here,
Eel.
And and then Cafe, can you hear
us so?
Uh, OK, so we're having trouble
hearing, yeah, so I'm gonna mute
you. Go ahead and unmute
yourself. Hopefully, that'll fix
it.
Oh, yes, can you guys hear me?
OK, thank you.
Hi, uh, my name is Isel Cardo,
and I'm an organizer and with NM
Cafean Las Cruces, New Mexico.
Um, I am here to speak um in
opposition of this bill, um, as
a cafe, we work with directly
impacted people to find the
solutions that work best for our
community.
And something that we often see
is
A lot of pushback from the
community, um.
Whether, you know, it be
Just
A lot of heartbreak, honestly,
um,
One of the recent stories that
we've had.
is we have families who are so
scared with the current just
climate and lack of empathy in
the state to where families are
moving together into apartments
right now.
Um,
I speak on the fear that is
current in the community because
You know, the words of.
Thank you so much. Uh, we're
gonna move on here. Um, we have,
uh, Denali.
And that,
yeah, and we're gonna remember
these comments are gonna be just
for one minute, and we are
taking uh public comment in
opposition to SB 85.
Campaign finance changes.
Denali, can you hear us?
OK, we're having a little
trouble here. Go ahead and
unmute yourself one more time.
Afraid not. We're gonna circle
back around to you, Denali, just
give us a little second here.
Uh, land, La Senna, can you hear
us?
Still having a little trouble
here. Go ahead and mute yourself
one more time.
Madam Chair, we can hear you. Go
ahead. Thank you, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, uh, we
stand in respectful opposition
to this bill, uh, we support the
issues of campaign finance
changes. However, with the
removal of the term political
purpose from the expenditure
definition, it now includes
anything that refers to a ballot
question or candidate with no
time frame limitation. We have
many concerns whether this is
the First Amendment violation
for our constitutional rights,
as well.
as putting C3s who conduct work
in doing issue education on what
happened in the legislature
during the session or even
during a special session,
anytime we do any communication
with things that are pertinent
to the legislature would be
deemed an independent
expenditure. Um, through this
and having to also disclose
donors, organizations that have
been marginalized and targeted,
whether it's immigration,
reproductive work, um, or issues
related to LGBTQ, those
donors do not feel safe. These
organizations already feel
targeted, and we were
respectfully opposed and hope
that the committee votes no on
this bill, and we hope to
continue the conversation and
work with the sponsors to have
something that could fit all of
our needs. Thank you.
Thank you so much, Lynn.
We're gonna uh go back to
Denali. Denali, can you hear us?
Hi committee, can you hear me
now? Yes.
Thank you so much, um, my name
is Denali Wilson. I'm a staff
attorney at the ACLU, um, and
just wanted to echo some of the
concerns just expressed, um,
while we absolutely are in
support of increased
transparency and accountability,
um,
I think as drafted, there are
some significant concerns about
the impact on, on protected
political speech, in particular,
as um the previous speaker just
said the removal of political
purpose from the definition of
expenditure, it appears that the
bill would broaden reporting
requirements to include routine
nonpartisan communication, um,
that simply mentions uh a
candidate or a ballot question,
um, as I said, this has
significant
For your First Amendment
concerns and would really create
some uncertainty for
organizations working to keep
the public informed, um,
additionally, the expanded
regulation of electronic
communications lacks some
clarity.
Thanks, is that my minute.
Thank you so much.
All righty. Um, lastly, I think
here we have, uh, Luis Guerrero.
Luis, can you hear us?
Yes, uh, good morning, uh, Madam
Chair, members of the committee.
My name is Luis Carrero with the
Center for Civic Action, um,
just also standing in opposition
to this bill for all a lot of
the reasons that have been
mentioned. Just wanted to add
that, ah, the language in
electronic communication really
is concerning to us, um.
Uh, we believe that there is a
policy alternative to this
concern that we use the FEC
definition, uh, and, uh, so,
yeah, we just, uh, stand in
opposition and thank you so much
for your time today.
Thank you so much, Louis, and
with that, we can move on.
OK, let's go back to the
audience, those in opposition,
please stand one minute, please.
Madam Chair, committee members,
Ata Chavez from NM Native Vote.
I love working elections, and
while we understand the need for
this bill and much need for
reform of our campaign finance
system in Mexico. We believe
that this bill would be
detrimental to many non-profit
organizations in our state,
removal of the term political
purpose from the expenditure
definition will cause harm to
501c3 funding. The primary
purpose of many of the Cres are
to educate the public on what's
happening during legislative
session.
and this would pull this type of
education into a regulated
political expenditure. I wanted
to alert you all to a letter
that was sent to the committee,
um, folks in opposition are ACLU
Cafe Axion, Center for Civic
Policy,
El Centro, equality in New
Mexico, and a Native vote, NM
working families, Olay organized
power and numbers, progressive
now in New Mexico, CEMA action,
and Sierra Club Rio Grande
chapter. We are due to vote now.
Thank you.
Hey, any further comments in
opposition, seeing none, I have
represented a block. Madam, I
think it would be helpful for us
to be able to respond first time
I've heard any of this
testimony, never copied on the
letter. There's already rules in
place that address this. I'd
like Ms. Bachmann to address
what the status quo is now,
which we're just trying to
codify. So I think it's
important for you to hear, and
again,
You know, this bill passed
unanimously in the Senate.
None of these groups came. I
think the way, the best way we
work legislation is not wait
till the last week and then show
up and not even have the
courtesy of copying the sponsor
with a letter that was sent. So
I just want to publicly make
that statement and I just yield
to Miss Bachmann to explain how
the law works right now and all
we're doing is codifying current
practice.
Thank you, please go right
ahead.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, I
apologize for my tardiness this
morning, um, Lindsay Bachmann
from the Secretary of State's
office. Madam Chair, um, members
of the committee, the Campaign
Reporting Act, as you all know,
regulates specific activity. It
does not regulate the spending
associated with nonprofit
entities, so it would regulate
political committees associated
with those entities if they had
a 501c4, for example, um, and as
the speech, piece related to
independent expenditures, there
is, um, there are promulgated
rules that define what would
require um disclosure and what,
what is considered political
speech. Um, there's a window and
I can.
There's a a window in 1.
10.13.31, um, it's disclaimer
notices on advertisements. Um,
it sets, um,
It sets, uh, kind of a
definition of what that that
advertisement is advertisements
that are disseminated by a
candidate, a campaign committee
or a political committee,
including a legislative caucus
committee registered pursuant um
to the role or at the request
suggestion of or in cooperation,
consultation, or in concert with
a candidate, a candidates
committee, or political
committee committee including a
legislative caucus committee. So
it's very specific as to uh as
what disclaimers would be
associated with that, and then
it goes on to say,
advertisements that are
disseminated by a person who has
made independent expenditures
and aggregate amount exceeding
$1000 during the current
election cycle and that either
A, expressly advocates the
election or defeat of a clearly
identified candidate or the
passage or defeat of a clearly
identified ballot question, or
B, referred to a clearly
identified candidate or ballot
question in are disseminated to
the relevant.
electorate within 30 days before
the primary election or 60 days
before the general election in
which the candidate or ballot
question is on the ballot.
The stand for questions.
Thank you, Representative Block.
Thank you, Madam Chair. And so,
first of all, I, before I even
ask questions, I, I looked on
the website and I couldn't find
this bill on the website, and
also the printed the goldenrod,
it was not.
On the agenda online for the
committee. So according to the
rules, how Rule 53.
3K, it says that it must be
online.
For the public. So, Madam Chair
Representative, I request.
This il be rolled since it was
not online and it does go
against our our house rule.
So, would that be possible,
madam?
Map we're happy to roll the
bill. Thank you.
Thank you, Senator. We will
reschedule your bill for
Tomorrow morning.
OK. Before we, um,
Call on House Bill 456. Let's uh
go ahead and talk about the two
consent bills.
I, um
shared a folder with you
yesterday and I inserted Senate
Bill 31 as amended and Senate
Bill 41 as amended were your
review to consider uh consenting
those two bills.
committee members.
Representative Barrago.
Thank you man, I make a motion
that we.
Um, proof.
Senate Bill 31.
A and Senate Bill 41A.
As a consent
I second that, Madam Chair. OK,
so I have a motion to.
Um, for a due pass for Senate
Bill 31 as amended.
And Senate Bill 41 as amended
and I have a second by
Representative Block. Do we have
any opposition?
Seeing none for the record,
those two bills, uh, have passed
this committee.
OK, let's move on to House Bill
456.
Thank you, Madam Chair. So I'm
stepping in for a Representative
Baca who had to present in
another committee. So I'm joined
here by Stan Rounds. And so,
Madam Chair and committee, this
bill pretty much just one thing,
it raises the caps for the use
of statewide price agreements
for procuring goods and
services, and it raises the caps
for these contracts for a single
project to 600 from 650 to $2
million those 650,000, and it
also raises.
from a single construction
project from 4 million to 7
million. It also raises the
limit of the value of the price
agreement, uh, contracts
awarded.
To a single vendor of
architectural and engineering
services from 7.5 million to 15
million over 10 years, and I'm
just gonna pass it over to, to
Mr. Rounds if he has anything to
add to that.
And Madam Chair, members of the
committee, good morning. The,
the only thing that was missed
is on page 2.
Line 13 or actually 11 through
13. It also raises the total
over a 10-year period from
12,500,000 to $30 million I'm
sure.
Sent for questions, Madam Chair.
OK, let's go to the audience. Do
we have anyone in the audience
who would like to speak in
support of this bill.
Anyone in the audience who would
like to speak in opposition of
this bill.
Seeing none, let's go online for
support and then opposition.
Anyone hoping to speak in
opposition to House Bill 456,
please raise your hand.
Yeah, and support of the bill,
please raise your hand.
OK. Looks like we have Bianca,
uh, OK good. Can you hear us?
Yes, I can. Can you hear me?
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Bianca Gutierrez, and I
apologize for not being there in
person. I'm sick. Um, one of the
problems that this bill is
trying to address is on the, the
current
Limit is 12.5 million, so right
now we're trying to crank out a
lot of road projects, a
contractor might hit that 12.5
million in a matter of 3 or 4
years, they will no longer be
able to do any business with the
state until they hit that
10-year period. So we're just
trying to make it easier to do
business in New Mexico. Thank
you.
Thank you so much, Bianca. Can I
move on now?
We have Jonathan, Jonathan Maus,
yes.
Yes, I can.
Good morning, madam chair
members of the committee. My
name is Jonathanius, and I'm
here to, uh, carry the support
as voted on by the Board of
County commissioners in Donana.
Support of this bill would allow
us to maintain our capital
projects on track, as y'all may
have noticed, some of the
capital expenses have gone, uh,
increasingly uh more expensive
over the last couple of years
and increasing these caps will
allow us to continue to work on
our projects and deliver them on
time. So thank you for your
support.
Thank you so much, Jonathan. All
right. Now, anyone hoping to
speak in opposition to the bill,
please raise your hand.
No takers. OK, let's move on.
Hey, Representative onion or
new?
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative, uh, for
bringing this bill forward this
morning. I just had a really.
Quick question. Since we're
raising limits on what um
Yeah, on contracts so the state
can enter into. Can you tell me
the last time the limits were
either raised or when the
current limit. Thank you, Madam
Chair. I'm going to push that
over to Mr. Rounds.
And Madam Chair, the historian,
uh, it has been, I believe, 5
years, Madam Chair, I will.
verify that we have run this uh
last year to try to raise it.
Uh, and so, Madam Chair, I
apologize. I don't have the
exact answer. I will get that
for you.
OK, thank you. And then there
were, um, some concerns about
the definition of um or how all
contracts.
is defined in the bill, whether
that is all contracts for state
agency or all contracts under a
single RFP.
Um
You
Expand on like the intent of
that definition.
Thank you, ma'am I'm sorry I
didn't mean to talk over you,
Madam Chair, uh, Representative.
The these are multiple source
contracts also so we've always
limited them in statute over the
years.
This continues that limitation
notion.
It did add the 10 year period in
this language.
Uh, which had been undetermined
to the point, I believe, uh,
Madam Chair Representative,
you're raising.
Uh, it is not every state
contract, these that would be
entered into our multiple
source.
Multiple year
Contracts. It affects GSA who
has signed off. In fact, that
these are the numbers they
recommended.
And then we have cooperative
educational services that does
many of the contracts for public
schools.
And we've negotiated with GSA to
get to these numbers that we
believe.
Will be functional. And so when
you get the language there about
all contracts, it's only those
who fall under the definition of
multiple source.
Thank you very much, Madam
Chair. Thank you.
Committee members Representative
Borego.
Madam Chair, I'd like to make a
motion that we approve House
Bill 456.
We have a motion by
Representative Barrego for Du
pass in a second by
representative Samoa. Do we have
any opposition?
Thank
you. Have a good day.
Senate Bill 353.
Representative, what bill are
you here for?
I'm here for 570.
All right, well, we were going
to hear 353, but.
You're here, so.
Well, can we hear 353 real
quick? Sure.
Thank you, Representative.
Senator, we'll hear your Senate
bill real quick.
OK, anytime you may begin. Thank
you, ma'am. I appreciate it. I'm
waiting on a bill next door too,
so I appreciate you getting me
in.
Colleague Senator Jeff Steinborn
here to present to you a bill
that I think will probably save
lives just a matter of time.
It's Senate Bill 353. to search
and rescue bill, madam Chair.
I'm joined by Bob Rogers, who is
the state police search and
rescue coordinator. I'll just
briefly summarize what this bill
does, Madam Chair committee, is
it requires local dispatchers
who get a call from someone in
an emergency situation or about
someone in an emergency kind of
wilderness.
Situation whose loss, whose
needs help, who's injured, who
may be disoriented, um, that it
requires a dispatcher to do one
extra step, which is to call the
state police.
Under New Mexico law, only the
state police can dispatch search
and rescue. It's pretty
interesting. All of our search
and rescue organizations around
the state, many of whom are
here, you see an orange. There
are these incredible
Public servants who give their
lives for free to um become very
technically trained to rescue
people, and they have
capabilities that local
jurisdictions, frankly don't
have. But by law, they can only
be dispatched when they're given
a mission by the state police.
It's kind of interesting. They
don't get dispatched by the
local government, they actually
have to get dispatched by Mr.
Rogers. So what's this, what
this law does, what this bill
does, Madam Chair, committees,
it would require a local
dispatcher whether wherever
they're at.
To recognize when someone is in
a search and rescue type of a
situation and need that kind of
help, then they have to call.
The state police as well as
their local emergency
responders. So that omission can
get created in search and rescue
can get called right away. In
addition to the local response
because time is everything in
the life of that person who's
missing. That's all the bill
does. It also improves
communication between the state
and the local level so that
they're all in communication
with each other while this is
happening.
With that mam chair, um,
Mr. Rogers likes to say
something, otherwise we'd stand
for questions.
Thank you. Go right ahead, Mr.
Rogers.
My name's Bob Rogers. I am the
search and risk resource officer
for the New Mexico State Police
Department of Public Safety. I'm
here to support this bill 100%
as all my volunteers behind me
support this as well. These
individuals could give a lot of
time, a lot of effort on their
own dime. This is a low cost
solution to saving lives and the
state of New Mexico. Thank you.
Thank you. With that, we will,
do you have an amendment?
OK. Thank you, Madam Chair. I
have a one-word amendment, the
same word repeated twice.
Do you have your amendment? Can
we read the 0.2 number.
Yeah, thank you, ma'am, chair,
and you all have it in front of
you, right? So it's, it's
essentially just a technical
amendment to strike the words um
service and change it to safety,
and this is just so that
terminology is, is technical
language used in the field, um,
to be precisely accurate and
Mr. Rogers and 10, I'm sorry,
you'd asked for the number 2.1
at the bottom.
That right? You want to read the
first part too?
OK. 0.23 1952.1.
You for the record.
Representative Anya Narnia move
the amendment for adoption.
Do we have any opposition to
moving the amendment, seeing
none, you have an amended bill.
And with that, we'll go to the
audience for comments in support
of the bill, one minute.
Um, I see there are many of you,
so let's take 5 comments. Thank
you.
So this
Thank you, Madam Chair,
Committee. My name is Chad
Pilkington. I'm a combat veteran
and I'm a volunteer with Dona
Anna County Search and Rescue. I
strongly support this
legislation because it will
enhance coordination and
response times during SAR
emergencies across New Mexico.
As a former bomb technician and
emergency responder in the army,
I know firsthand the necessity
of timely responses and the
effect that it has on the
propensity for the protection of
personnel and property. Tsar is
no different in its importance.
Establishing standardized
criteria and notification
protocols ensures that states
our resources are activated
swiftly when needed, reducing
confusion.
among agencies and improving
outcomes for those in distress.
So our missions rely on seamless
cooperation between state,
local, and federal agencies and
this legislation strengthens
that framework, timely and
efficient responses save lives,
not commend the legislature
prior prioritizing the critical
issue. Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and the
committee. Uh, my name is Jenna
Burgess. I am the uh emergency
manager for Santa Fe Indian
School and a search and rescue
volunteer with Santa Fe, uh,
search and rescue. I am the vice
president of of Hisearch and
Rescue and our uh team is, you
know, we get called out for
things that happen out here. Uh,
we have seen a lot of uh recent
uh delays in our dispatch, uh,
as far as a lot of the silver
alerts that have gone out
recently. I'm sure you've seen
in the news, um, and I would
like to point out just one
other.
quick example that occurred uh
this week. There was a cave
rescue down in Carlsbad, New
Mexico, uh, that I was unaware
of until yesterday, and that
occurred to, like I said, now 3
days ago, uh, I'm a cave rescue
instructor with the National
Cave Rescue Commission. And so
for the fact that we have these
resources here in the state, and
they're not being called out
because the dispatch centers
aren't calling state police to
activate those resources. This
is why I'm sitting here today.
Hi, I'm uh Madam Chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Laurie Dodge. I'm a
member of the incident
management team in New Mexico
search and rescue. I'm also the
treasurer of the New Mexico
Search and Rescue Council, and I
just want to make a couple of
points to clarify that we are
not taking away from the paid
agencies.
Absolutely, we need them. We
need them to deploy as soon as
they get the calls. What we're
asking is that we get deployed
at the same time, and that way
we can augment the payday
agency's services. We come in
with a different skill set. We
have technical training, and we
have training in wilderness
settings, oftentimes the paid
agencies don't have that kind of
training, so their skill set is
a different type of skill set.
We're here to to augment that
and
We are considered a reverse
appropriation. We are all
volunteers and we're working for
free.
Therefore, we're saving money
for the state, and so we would
like to point out that that is a
real viable resource for the
state for us to be working for
free.
Thank you, Madam the chair and
members of the committee areil
Harbin, I'm a New Mexico's
returns advocate. New
Mexicoertransky medical
coordinator. Um, I just want to
point out that people already
have died because of these
issues or suffered unnecessary
harm, and they, they will
continue to do so if we don't
pass this bill. We are really
trying to prepare for the
outdoor recreation division's
success, the call volume for
search and rescue missions will
skyrocket, um, and we're not
ready for it unless this bill
passes a just as
Laurie said, we are working, we
want to work with the other
agencies. This promotes
collaboration, this doesn't
delay the dispatch of any other
agencies, doesn't require
additional funding.
Other agencies offer a small
part of search and rescue
services, we offer the full
extent of search and rescue
services. It also reduces the
liability for those other
agencies and keeps them safe
because a lot of times they are
taken on unnecessary risk and
can potentially harm themselves
when they're responding to
missions, we're there to again
help make sure they stay safe
and reduces their reliability
and thank you.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee. My name is uh Major
Leare.
I represent the special
operations bureau for the state
police, and uh we strongly
support SBL 3530.
For many reasons, obviously.
Ah, explained well by the field
coordinator here, but
For that.
One reason that
time is in essence when it comes
to search and rescue, um, all
we're asking is for a local
entities to call us to give us a
uh.
Just to give us a phone call uh
when they received a phone call
so we can prepare our resources
to be able to deploy at the same
time as the local in point
but again we we strongly support
this.
Thank you.
Are there any comments in the
audience in opposition?
wish to speak?
All right, see then, Madam
Chair. Let's go online.
Let's take.
We have uh Robert Garcia.
Robert, can you hear us?
Yes, I can. Can you hear me?
Yes, we sure can. You have one
minute. Go ahead.
Thank you.
Madam chair, members of the
committee, my name is Robert
Garcia. I am the president of
the New Mexico Search and Rescue
Council. Some of my team member,
the team, some of my teams
showed up today. Um, we have 35
member teams across the state,
all stand in support of this
bill too many times have the
team seen delayed notifications
for missions. I myself as a
commander have seen a delayed
notification one time in
Timburon, New Mexico of 2 weeks.
Where the sheriff had searched
that first day, they then
stopped. We came in 2 weeks
later and we found the subject
in a short amount of time. Um,
it is a travesty of what is
going on with local agencies not
notifying search and rescue of
incidents in Mexico state
police.
That is all. Thank you so much
for your time.
Thank you so much, Robert.
Anyone else hoping to make
public comment in support of the
bill, please raise your hand.
OK. Sing Nan, was there anyone
hoping to make public comment in
opposition to the bill.
See you now. Cheer.
Hey, Representative Zamora.
Chairman of Dupe.
Motion by representative Zamora
for DuPass, a second by vice
chair. Do we have any
opposition?
Senator, you have a pass. Thank
you, as amended.
Thank you committee and thanks
to all the search and rescue
people who came today.
We appreciate it.
Let's go back to
Leader Armstrong.
You, Madam Fleur leader.
Armstrong.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and uh
thank you for, I'm jogging
around the roundhouse this
morning, so I appreciate the
patience
I'm creating disturbance
everywhere I go, so thank you
for your patience. Uh, thank
you, Madam Chair, I'm presenting
this for Representative Jennifer
Jones, who's presenting in
another committee. This is House
Bill 570 relating to insurance
aitting and enacting solution
sections of the prior
authorization Act to prohibit
the imposition.
And prior authorization
requirements for certain covered
services, um, and prescription
medication. Um, and with, I
stand for questions.
Hey, let's go to the audience.
Do we have anyone in the
audience who wishes to speak in
support. Raise your hands.
Any opposition?
OK, please.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Brent
Moore. I'm a registered lobbyist
for America's health insurance
plans, and we stand in
opposition to this bill. Uh, we
stand in opposition to this bill
because it does several things.
Uh, what it does is it limits
prior authorization and prior
authorization is a proven uh
tool to ensure that patients
receive a safe, effective, and
evidence-based care. Uh, this
medical knowledge increases
exponentially, and medical
knowledge doubles every 73 days,
and so it's really difficult for
primary care providers, uh, to
keep up with that expansion of
knowledge, and we think that it
maintaining prior authorization
is a good thing. The bill also
addresses step therapy. and step
therapy once again ensures that
people are getting the care that
they need, but getting the drugs
that they need at uh the lowest
cost possible, I would note for
you when you look to the FIR
there's a significant cost
associated with these proposed
changes and that those those uh
that cost will be incorporated.
Or many of the state agencies.
And finally, I would note.
OK. Thank you. Let's go online.
Anyone hoping to make public
comment and support of HB 570,
please raise your hand.
OK. See none. Uh, anyone hoping
to speak in opposition to House
Bill 570. Please raise your
hand. OK, we have Jonathan.
Jonathan, can you hear us?
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee. My name is
Jonathan Buxton with
pharmaceutical Care Management
Association. Uh, we are the
National Association
Representing Pharmacy benefit
managers. Uh, we respectfully,
um, are in the position of
opposed to this bill, um, as
mentioned before, prior
authorization is a valuable tool
for both cutting costs, saving
money, and saving patients'
lives, uh, as a safety
mechanism, prior authorization
is used to make sure that
doctors have access to the most
up to
They, uh, information and
medical data and for payers, it
helps make sure that most of the
care provided is necessary. The
American Medical Association
assumes that about 25% of all
medical spending is unnecessary
or low value care. Prior
authorization is one of the ways
we can cut that. We encourage
you to oppose this bill.
Thank you so much, Jonathan. Up
next we have Marla. Marla, can
you hear us?
That's registered lobbyists.
Right, go ahead, Marla, we can
hear you now.
Oh, you can, uh, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, Marla
Schultz, registered lobbyist for
Blue Cross Blue Shield of New
Mexico. We respectfully oppose
House Bill 570. Last session,
the legislature passed
prohibitions on prior
authorization for certain
classes of drugs including
chemotherapy and autoimmune
medications. This came into
effect January 1st. We believe
it would be prudent for the
legislature to assess the
impacts of that statute prior to
adding new prohibitions.
Also, we have been working with
the New Mexico Medical Society
on compromised legislation that
is currently going through the
process that will gold card
providers for prior auth. This
means providers that have a high
rate of approval will no longer
have to do prior authorization.
Finally, House Bill 570 is very
comprehensive. We ask that this
be discussed through the interim
as these are complex in broad
terms. For example, and as noted
in the FIR we use prior auth as
a tool
Medicaid for dialysis to ensure
that. Thank you so much, Marla.
No song.
All right, committee members
represented block.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you, Madam Leader for
being here. So I know that.
You're not, you, you're probably
on the bill somewhere, but I
just don't want to grill you, so
to speak. So Madam Chair,
representative, I'm just
wondering, do you know how this
could affect healthcare
premiums. I don't know if the
bill sponsors have spoken to you
about that question.
Um, Madam Chair, uh,
representative, um, I'm not 100%
sure how this could affect
healthcare premiums. All I know
for sure is that um from what
I've heard in the past is that
this, um, the healthcare
providers spend a lot of time
and possibly have a whole
another person that does all
these prior authorizations,
takes a lot of time, energy,
effort, and money to uh to go
through that process, and these
are all, um, the majority of
these are things that, um, uh,
are very.
um
Unfortunately common in the
state of New Mexico, and it
would help to just
Uh, speed up the process of
getting them on the medication
as soon as possible.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair
Representative. So I, I guess I
do have a
Concerned when it comes to
What kind of costs that could
incur for
Everyone's premiums and then I
just do have some concerns when
it comes to the uh actual cost
of those drugs cause some of
them can be very expensive, and
that could, in my opinion, maybe
increase costs on that end, so.
I, I think I'm just gonna be a
no on this now because I do not
have enough information, but
thank you so much for bringing
this forward, Madam Chair.
And Madam Chair, we are well
aware of the gold card standard
that's moving through the, uh,
the, the, um
House and Senate right now, um,
this is, uh, brought to you, um,
with, with Jennifer Jones, Liz
Thompson's on the bill, and
Joshua Hernandez, but they're
all tied up. So my apologies if
I'm not uh the best witness.
OK, committee members.
Representative Brago. Thank you,
Madam Chair, and, and thank you,
uh, Madam Flora later, um.
You know, I
driven up to the window.
Pharmacy trying to get a
prescription for my mother and
and been rejected.
When she needed her high blood
pressure medicine. Um,
I have
Mixed feelings about this only
because um I, I see that portion
of it is like, oh no, you don't
have a prior authorization. We
have to get that and it takes
time to do that.
Especially when they're like
right at the end of their their
medication and they're, they're
needing to get, I've seen that
side, but the other side of it
is, and, and, uh,
representativelock brought that
issue up, which in my mind also
is like, how does this affect?
The entire sort of
Um
systems, I guess, um.
Of getting medications and how,
how that, so I, I'm sort of torn
a little bit on this bill, um, I
mean, I want to support it, but
on the other hand, I don't know,
I don't feel like I have all the
information.
To make a really good decision.
And Madam Chair, I'd just like
to add, uh, in, in committee,
um, I've had, I've been to the
doctor before where they uh
prescribe a medication and
waiting for prior authorization
and then finding out that that's
not, uh, they, they won't
authorize it.
My insurance won't cover that.
So then I have to be, play tag
with trying to get some other
kind of medication authorized.
And so, um,
I understand completely that
this could make insurance costs
go up, understandably, but it
would also, uh, Madam Chair
Representative.
Be able to uh mitigate the fact
of
The constant employers that we
have that are trying to
Get all of these authorizations.
So, um, just food for thought.
Representative Vice Chair
Little.
Thank you, Madam chair.
Thank you, Representative, for
bringing this bill forward.
Um, met him, um, I was formerly
in another lifetime. I was a
hospital ambulatory care, uh,
hospital administrator.
And we in the Indian Health
Service, and because of limited
federal funding, it was always
and.
Um
Our executive team was in the
unenviable position of having
determined.
Which care came first.
Especially like this and as uh
one of my colleagues uh
presented, Madam Chair, uh,
these are not uncommon illnesses
in this state at all.
And um
It
Sometimes resulted, uh, well,
not often resulted Madam Chair,
in our
are um
Chief Medical Officer and the uh
The nurse administrator, uh,
advocating on the patient's
behalf.
Because they knew their
patients.
And would advocate for them.
And, uh, sometimes these
unnecessary delays actually
exacerbated this.
These illnesses. So, um, a
couple of questions. I can
understand uh why the
reluctance, uh, as it pertains
to
Um
It's probably not a fair
example, but the federal system
of having to work with a
prescribed budget.
And not uh private insurance or
other sources of insurance.
It's, it's, uh, there is a
difference.
But I definitely see, Madam
Chair, the necessity of
Of um
Eliminating
time.
That and delays for patience.
Can you tell me, uh, uh,
Madam.
Huh
4, minority floor leader. Thank
you. um, uh, what
Uh, and I apologize if I missed
it, uh, in your introduction,
um, Madam Chair, I'd like to
hear about the timelines that um
have been presented to you in
conceiving and putting forth
this bill.
Please. Um, thank you for the
question, Madam Chair. So, um,
as I stated before, just the
story of, you know, the doctor
um prescribing something, going
to pick it up. My insurance
doesn't cover it. I have to get
something else, so that timeline
is one thing. The other timeline
is just waiting for
pre-authorization, um, that, and
I'm sure you're aware of that,
it could be a couple of days
before you could have your
medication. The other part is
that at the, and I'm not sure,
Madam Chair and, and
representatives.
It's a, if it's an OSI or at the
executive level, but they, um,
one or the other has done away
with prior authorizations for
other things.
Um, and one of them is gender
affirming care, no
preauthorization for that. Um,
and so we, we could do it at an
executive level. Uh, we're
trying to name specific things
in here.
That
We would like to see covered
alongside other things that have
already been made that decision
for, um,
Or the insurance companies and
the doctors at the state level.
Thank you, thank you, Madam
Chair and Madaminner the leader,
um,
One of the questions I think
that is key here is, um, can you
tell me, tell us why?
Uh, diabetes and high blood
pressure were added to the list
of conditions for
therapy exemptions, Madam Chair.
Uh, Madam Chair, uh,
Representative, diabetes and,
and high blood pressure.
And uh and my sponsor's opinion
doesn't need to be um
Have a prior authorization. If
you have diabetes, you should
start treatment right away.
Whatever treatment the doctor
thinks is best for you.
Uh, and not waiting on those,
um, prior authorizations. Same
thing with high blood pressure.
Thank you. Thank you, Madam
Chair. That's.
I have a quick question, just
reading the FIR um pertaining to
elder care is not defined in
this bill or the insurance code.
Um, can you
Help us define elder care.
Madam Chair Representative, um,
I, I believe that it would be if
you needed to take care of
someone that is elderly, um,
and, and possibly uh um
I don't know what the term is,
uh, if you needed to place them
in a facility.
Um, to not get prior
authorization for that.
OK, or in home or hospice
situation. Yes, in-home hospice,
uh, healthcare, um, things like
that, but mostly in home or if
you needed to place them in a
facility.
All righty. Representative
Zamora,
Madam.
And for do pass by
representative Zamora, a second
byresentative Mejia.
Do we have any opposition,
please call Roll.
Representative Onon Nonu.
Yes. Representative Block? No,
sir. Representative Borego.
Representative Lujan,
Representative Mia.
Madam Flo leader?
Yes. Representative Zamora.
Madam Vice Chair, yes.
Madam Chair, Madam Chair, by a
vote of 62, the motion passes.
And representedrego to explain
your vote. Um, thank you, Madam
Chair, um, and I may support
this on the floor, um, Madam
Chair, and, uh.
Senate floor,
I'm sorry.
Representative floor leader, um,
I think that I don't have enough
information right now and I
really need to get more
information about this. So if
that can be provided with regard
to
The questions that were raised,
I would love to support this
bill. Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and I'm
sure the bill sponsor will do a
much better job than I did. So I
appreciate the, the chance and
to hopefully we can hear it on
the floor and I'm sure she'll
have all those answers. Thank
you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative.
OK, let's move along to House
Bill 618 representative Cerrado.
You, Madam Chair. Thank you
committee for hearing us this
morning. Um, we do have this
committee substitute that was
put on, do we have to go through
that process? No, OK.
Oh,
it's funny that's what commerce
does to me every time I come in.
Um
OK, do I have to move the
committee substitute for
conversation or let's go ahead
and move the committee
substitute.
I'll move uh the committee
substitute.
For uh conversation, explain the
committee substitute.
Absolutely. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Uh this is my expert day,
uh, secretary, uh, do it
secretary Manny Barreras. Um,
the House government and
elections and Indian Affairs
Committee, uh potential
committee substitute is on top
of a generic bill. Um, oh, I'm
sorry, the, the, the number is
231-549.1.
Apologies. Um, this committee
substitute is because it was a
generic bill before and so, uh,
essentially, just with some of
the slowing downs we saw see in
the other chamber right now. We
brought it over here because it
is a fairly important bill to
streamline the work and do it.
Essentially this bill removes
duplicate or this substitute
removes duplicate duplicative
work so that the uh enterprise
project management office within
Do it can focus on their primary
work, which is supporting
departments and agencies on
oversight training and project
uh support in general.
It saves money and what it does
is it says that the um
procurement um process of
overseeing those contracts under
the IT contracts, will then just
be done through GST. This is
something that is also supported
by the uh acting secretary of
GST, um, she has a quote, uh,
that she said that, uh, says
this is this integration is a
win for state agencies, vendors
and Mexico taxpayers by
centralizing procurement
functions we're removing
redundancies, enhancing
accountability, and ensuring a
smoother experience for everyone
involved. This is another step
towards modernizing.
how we do business in state
government. I'm going to hand it
to my expert, um, to for
additional comments.
Madam Chair and committee
members, thank you so much. I
also want to thank
Representative Cerrado for the
sponsorship on this uh
Madam Chair and committee
members, thank you so much. I
also want to thank
Representative Cerrado for the
sponsorship on this particular
bill. Appreciate that.
So pri primarily this bill and
these IT procurement moves,
basically transitioning 19
procurement and contracts to the
state purchasing division at the
general uh General Services
department, uh, some of the
current challenges that we face
are, are, are basically project
management offices a significant
amount of time on IT documents
review, limiting project
oversight and causing approval
delays, uh, impact on the
agencies which we have, you
know,
our constituents are 76
agencies, which include all the
executives, the boards and
commissions.
So basically, it will do faster
approval, streamline processes
mean quicker uh contract and
project uh execution. We can
have more support, EPMO will
focus on helping agencies with
program project management
oversight, training, and project
sources and, and successes, uh,
data-driven decisions, uh,
enhanced analytics provide
actionable insights for future
planning and risk mitigation.
And for future statute or state
uh proactive planning begin IT
strategic planning in April, May
instead of July.
Uh, streamlining PCC meetings,
uh, submit documents earlier 2
weeks before PCC meetings member
can access questions, documents,
and advance. Thank you.
Before we take questions, I know
as you consider this bill, I
wanted to also point out that it
is the secretary's birthday
today. So, uh, with that, we now
stand for questions. Yeah, thank
you.
Do we want to sing Happy
Birthday.
OK.
All righty.
So let's go ahead and move the
committee substitutes for
adoption.
Um, do you have any opposition?
OK.
Now let's go to the audience. Do
we have any comments and
support?
Do we have any opposition?
Let's go online.
hoping to make public comment in
opposition to the House Bill
618. Please raise your hand.
Anyone hoping to make any public
comment in favor of the bill.
See no.
Committee members.
Representative Block
and then, but
OK, great.
Hey, we have a motion for a due
passed by Representative Block,
second by Representative
Barrago, do we have?
Any opposition.
Seeing none, you have a due
pass.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you committee. Thank you.
Oh my God.
Thanks. I'm all red now.
Maybe, let's, um,
what?
Right well
let's, um, let's move along to
House Bill 57 I see Senator
Cervantes is in the room.
Bye.
I'll tell, I'll, I'll tell you
it's my birthday. Uh, it feels
like it sometimes.
Oh, man, I'm sure I'm ready when
you are.
Thank you, Madam Chair members
of the committee. We struggle in
uh here in Santa Fe, in the
legislature in our state with
how do we address guns and gun
violence and gun safety and for
quite some time now, I've
Taking the position that is a
gun owner lifetime gun owner
that it's incumbent on me and
other gun owners to be the
solution, uh, to be the tip of
the spear, if you will, in
finding a reasonable solutions.
This bill addresses our
concealed carry law in New
Mexico when I was part of the
original effort to enact the
concealed carry law here in the
state of New Mexico. This is the
law that allows individuals to
carry a firearm in a concealed
way and requires a training
program, a permitting program,
and so forth.
The bill here tries to do
fundamentally tries to get more
people to be responsible gun
owners. I think gun owners fall
into three categories. There's
responsible gun owners, there's
irresponsible gun owners, and
there's criminals, and it's
important for us to always make
that distinction.
So so when I uh obtained my
concealed carry permit, it was a
a very uh long two-day weekend.
I don't know, I'm looking at
some of you all who may have the
permit. It, it's a, it's uh
unreasonable amount of time and
it's hard to stretch content
into 2 days talking about guns.
There's not that much to a gun,
there's not that much involved,
and it's not that complex, but
it, but it's an important class,
it's an important class to learn
about the laws.
Things like the castle doctrine
when uh it's legal and what not
legal to use a farm and how to
do so. So the, the point of this
bill is to encourage more people
to have concealed carry and to
make it easier to do that, to
take the classes and to further
distinguish the difference
between lawful and responsible
gun owners and irresponsible and
unlawful gun owners.
And and ultimately try to make
that that distinction even more
and more clear, so.
Um, the, the build is a number
of things, um, first of all, in
the uh section 2, I'll just tell
you, well, first I'll start with
the first section of the bill,
right, right now the law allows
you to qualify for a concealed
carry permit based on the
caliber of the weapon, you have
to, you can only you can only
qualify for a certain caliber.
We're taking out that
distinction because in my
experience, everybody who
qualifies uses the highest
caliber weapon to qualify, so
they'll always be able to carry
the highest caliber and then
everything underneath that. So
that's almost a a distinction
without a difference.
Um, in section 2 right now,
you'll see an addition of a
lawful permanent resident, a
lawful permanent resident can
own a gun and lawful permanent
resident can buy a gun, so they
should um be able to have a
concealed carry permit, it
shouldn't be limited only to
citizens.
Uh, we had, um, we had proposed
to change uh the age by which
you could carry a concealed
carry permit. I lost that in the
Senate. I wanted to lower that
to 19 because a 19 year old can
buy and and own and carry a gun
openly. It seemed to me that it
only made sense that we should
be able to go through the
training and the course and get
a concealed carry permit. I, I
wasn't able to maintain that in
the Senate. They, they left that
at the, at the age that it was
before.
And the other changes mostly
just deal with again the effort
to try and um.
Try and reduce the hours, you'll
see that fundamentally on page 6
from a, from a 15 hour course to
6 hours, and that's a much more
reasonable when we work with
some of the people that provide
the training, the, the class got
so absurd. I'm I'm I'm seeing a
lot of nods of people that have
done the class when you're
trying to stretch this course of
16 hours we spent time talking
about.
Holsters you can buy and purses
that women can carry and, you
know, I mean it, it, it, you
know, you're trying desperately
to find some kind of content, it
it gets kind of absurd and we
don't want to be doing that.
Uh, one of, one of the big
differences with the bill
relates to reciprocity. In other
words, what circumstances that
will allow individuals from
other states who meet their
qualifying requirements to, to
have a concealed carry in New
Mexico, um, and then section 6
adopts really what are already
kind of the regulations that are
that are being enforced with
regard to issuing a concealed
carry. So for example, not
carrying and consuming alcohol
at the same time and things of
that kind.
Um, and last, probably most
important but buried in small
text at the, at the back is uh
the last page, page 17.
Which would change.
What is now a petty misdemeanor
to a misdemeanor, right, right
now, if you conceal carry
without a permit, it's a petty
misdemeanor. And when I, when I
went and got my permit, uh, some
of my friends said, why bother
taking the time to go do all of
that, uh, you go get a concealed
carry permit, and if you carry
conceal without a permit, it's a
petty misdemeanor, so it's
almost not worth the effort to
go and get the concealed carry
permit and a petty misdemeanor.
So we're increasing the penalty
for doing that.
Ultimately, I would want to
leave you with a thought when,
when we look at gun violence and
there's talk, this session about
assault weapon bans and we
talked about any number of
different things on guns. The
reality is most of our gun
violence takes place on Friday
night.
Saturday night, some kid didn't
get into the party. Somebody
made some comment about
somebody's girlfriend. Somebody
had too much to drink.
Uh, somebody, um, we, we know
the stories, some teenagers were
showing off a gun, uh, somebody
was trying to, to be a big man.
And, and that really is the
reality of where the most of the
gun violence happens.
When I grew up, we would have
never thought on a Friday night,
we went out to the river and
somebody had a keg or whatever,
we would have never thought of
taking a gun. We certainly
wouldn't have been out there
trying to show off or play with
guns. There's a, there's a
mindset that, that exists now
with our younger people in
particular that guns are a
status symbol or a toy or a
bragging right or something of
that kind. I, I think we need to
begin to make sure that that
kids are a little more fearful
about taking a gun to school in
their backpack.
Or, or taking a gun to a party.
And so I'm increasing the
penalties on, on having a
concealed carry weapon without a
permit and, and I'm trying to
hopefully get that mindset out
there. So this bill does an
interesting thing we've got gun
proponents who support it and
gun opponents who support it. I
think that's a good sign that
hopefully means that we're at
the sweet spot where those of us
that are gun owners are taking
some leadership and some
responsibility. So man, I'm sure
that's the, the bill and I'll
stand for your questions.
Thank you, Senator. Let's go to
the audience. Do we have any
comments and support?
OK. Let's take a
Comment.
sir.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name's William
Fire and I'm a retired computer
scientist here in Santa Fe, and
I'm one of uh Madam floor
leadershipansky's constituents.
Uh, I'm also one of the 43,000
concealed carry licensees in New
Mexico, and I am here to support
this bill and Senator Cervantes.
I thank him for bringing this
forward.
Our concealed carry laws worked
well in the public safety arena
for many years, but we know now
that the training requirements
were inappropriate. This bill
fixes that. I urge you to give
it due consideration. Thank you,
Madam Chair, members of the
committee.
Thank you. Let's go online.
OK, anyone hoping to make a
public public comment in support
of Senate Bill 507, please raise
your hand now.
OK, Singan. Anyone hoping to
make public comment in
opposition to Senate Bill 507.
Please raise your hand now.
See, OK, we have one here.
Darla, Darla, can you hear us?
This is Dale Perkins, and I'm
here at Darla's house. She's
being very wonderful to me. On
this bill, you're taking 15
hours' worth of stuff and
cramming it into 6. I'm sorry,
I'm an NRA counselor and I'm an
NRA instructor. I teach the
concealed. I've got 3900
students, and I have so many
students come back.
2 years later and going, how do
I drop my slide? I'm sorry, our
public is very
Lazy, they will not stay up with
the laws, rules, and
regulations. I do agree with the
part that he said that we need
to take and raise the penalties
for someone that does not have a
concealed. I agree with that
100%. But the other, the 4 year
and the 2 year we need to keep,
we need to keep the hours cause
she's wanting us to take exactly
the same.
Time frame.
As to uh 6 hours and
Out of 15, and we can't do it.
I'm sorry, we're teaching what
he's asking us to teach. Thank
you so much.
Thank you so much, Dale. I
appreciate your public comment.
Is there anyone else hoping to
speak up in uh in uh opposition
extended or Senate Bill 507.
Seeing none, chair.
Let's go back to the audience.
Do we have any anyone who would
to make a comment in opposition.
Seeing a committee members,
representative block.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you, Senator, Mr.
Chairman, good to see you. And
uh it's good to see you in the
interim on CCJ, but it's also
good to see you here in the
house side. It's a good side to
be on. But Madam Chair
Representative, I, I do like
your bill. I do. So I'm not
gonna beat it up too much, but
Miss Madam Chair Representative,
I do have one question relating
to reciprocity when it comes to
the legally, I forget what it
is.
A legal non-permanent resident,
do other states also have this
provision just, I don't want
this to
Catch any kind of reciprocity
questions, Madam Chair and
representative.
Senator, pardon me.
Um, Madam Chair and
Representative, so I, I don't
know and I haven't surveyed all
the other states to figure out
what they have or don't have. I
can tell you that DPS has done
that for us. In other words,
they've evaluated what other
states have qualifying
requirements that compare
favorably to New Mexico's, but
what this bill does is assure
that New Mexico will not
recognize reciprocity for a
state that does not have at
least a stringent requirements
as we do. And, and, and that
really is the ultimate goal.
I'll tell you that there's,
there's talk, and I hear it,
that there's
Um, some consideration in
Congress and by this
administration to put some kind
of a national reciprocity in
place and I, I hope we don't go
there, uh, because as you
probably know, representative
some states like Texas have
minimal if any requirements on
concealed carry, and so we begin
to accept reciprocity, we're
gonna find ourselves compared to
states that have too few
restrictions and, and then we
may find ourselves compared to
states that probably like
California or other have very
onerous requirements and, and
more stringent than ours, so.
The, the goal here is to simply
make sure that what we will
maintain that whatever standards
we require here in New Mexico
are honored, um, and nothing
less than that.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
Senator, I appreciate that. And
so I
I do like the idea of uh making
a compromise bill. I think that
that's actually something you're
good at in many, many ways when
it comes to legislating. Madam
Chair, Representative, I also
Was wondering cause I heard, I
heard comments that it's not
enough time. I believe it's
enough time, the, the 6 hours, I
believe it is. Could you just go
a little bit into that, uh, for
me, how we arrived on that
number and uh
Why it's necessary to not keep
people over the entire weekend
and just on Saturday.
Um
So representative, it, it is
based on conversations with
people that teach the class. I
heard from Mr. Perkins, I think,
who said he thinks it's not
enough time. He's an instructor,
so I'm, I recognize that he may
have an advantage financially to
having the course longer and
more time and more days and more
repetitive reasons and I don't
mean to, to be negative toward
his comments, but um I, I, I
assure you that it sounds like
I'm noting from Donnao your body
language, you may have done this
course yourself. Um, anyone who
owns a gun, anyone who's grown
up with guns, um,
The the use of a firearm for
your personal defense or for
sport purposes relatively pretty
simple, uh, trying to make that
a six-hour discussion, even 6
hours of stop but uh right now
putting that over 2 days,
there, there's just no content.
There's a lot of long breaks.
Take a morning break that's an
hour you take an afternoon
break, that's an hour and you
take a 2 hour lunch and again,
the goal here is to try and make
it easier for people to
efficiently go in, get a permit,
work responsibly and, and join
the responsible gun ownership
and, and I think 6 hours is a
good Saturday that allows time
for you to uh demonstrate
proficiency. The proficiency is
requirement part of the permit,
you've got to go out on the
range, you've got to fire the
weapon, you've got to be able to
hit a target.
Um, it's a pretty simple that
even even though that self is
pretty simple, you know, you're
you're not shooting at a target
from very far away and even the
proficiency uh part of the day
is maybe 15 minutes at most to
discharge him a couple of
magazines and hit a target.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you, uh, Senator. I do
appreciate that and I think
That I've had a bill that has
died repeatedly, but it's a
constitutional carry to make it
easier for people to, to be able
to carry with
Just, uh, if they want to or
not, but I think this makes it a
little easier for people because
my opinion is, Madam Chair and
Senator, that the more people
who are lawfully carrying, the
fewer people.
will be inclined to harm other
people because there may
actually be an incentive for
them not to target people
because they could be armed, and
I think that it's a very good
principle, I think it's a very
good thing to make it easier for
people to protect themselves.
So, I, I like the idea of the
bill and I will support it. So
thank you so much, uh, Madam
Chair. Thank you so much,
Senator, and I don't know if you
have any other comments on that,
but thank you. Well, I
appreciate the fact you're gonna
support the bill, but I, I would
probably push back on the notion
that this bill is about making
it easier to carry. That's not
the goal. The goal is not to
make it easier to gear. The goal
is to make it easier to have a
certificate in the training and
the qualifications to carry,
because the reality is the
these young people, young
people, many people, they're
carrying anyway.
They're, they're carrying these
weapons, they're in their
backpacks, they're in their
pockets, they're in their coats
and um so the the I don't think
this is gonna increase people
caring I think the goal here is
to maybe discourage people from
caring. That really is the goal,
carrying irresponsibly, and
that's, as I said, that's where
our gun violence is taking
place. It's people who are
taking guns to the the Friday
night poker game or to the, to
the family gatherings or out to
the river to have a beer, uh,
that's where the violence is
taking place. Kids who can't get
into the party, who get kicked
out of the party.
All of those are the
circumstances, that's where our
problem lies. It's again, we, we
see the headlines with the mass
killings, we're trying to attack
assault weapons are
understandably, but um if you
really want to look at the gun
violence, it's, it's the one on
ones, it's the irresponsible
people who are in a bad moment,
in a bad place at a bad time.
Madam Taran and Senator I I
probably should have phrased
that better, easier to get a
permit, right? Easier to, to get
that so that someone can have
the option to indeed protect
themselves if necessary. We've
seen some cases across the
entire country where there was a
like a shooter at a church, and
there were congregants who came
and they, they had concealed
carry permits and they
Help save lives. So I think it
does save lives in many cases
and like you said, we want to
make sure that people who are
unlawfully carrying are not. And
I, I think that's why we
increased the penalty from a
petty to a misdemeanor. So I
think it does both. It's a good
dance in my opinion, and I, I'm
happy to support the bill. Thank
you, Madam Chair, and thank you,
Senator.
You represent a block I
represented a vice chair Little
and then Representative Anya
Nornu and then Madam Floor
leader.
Madam Chair, I'd like to move a
due pass.
come back to your motion, vice
chair. Representative Anya
Narnu.
Thank you Madam Chair, um, and
thank you, Senator, for bringing
this bill forward today. I just
had a couple of questions about
like the.
process
that we have in place or that
the process for getting a
concealed carry that this bill
would allow. So.
Do we currently require or would
this bill additionally require
that you get like fingerprints
or background check for a
concealed carry. Is that already
in the law or would that those
are already requirements of
getting a concealed carry
permit, although what we're
doing is we're putting it in
statute right now those are part
of the regulations that are
adopted by the DPS in issuing
this, but we're trying to
enshrine that if you will, in
statute.
OK, thank you for that. And
also,
Not yet a lawyer, I should say.
Can you tell me the difference
between like a petty misdemeanor
versus a misdemeanor. No, I was
afraid you'd do that. So I,
I, I'm not a criminal, uh,
defense lawyer. I, I have an
expert or two probably in the
room, but um a petty
misdemeanor, I think is 6
months. Does that sound right?
Uh, and misdemeanors up to a
year.
And I'm not sure about the
financial fines and penalties,
but, um, that, that's, I think
principally the big difference
is the sentence, 6 months versus
a year. OK, thank you very much,
Mo chair and senator. And
lastly, um, would this do
anything to expand the locations
that you're allowed to conceal
carry your gun to.
Don't like ending a sentence in
a preposition. But you know what
I mean.
Madam Chair, again, you'll see
some language in here about
where restrictions so you can't
be in a place consuming alcohol
and so forth, again, those are
already enshrined in regulations
in, in issuing a permit, but
this wouldn't change any
locations it wouldn't expand the
locations. You can conceal
carry. OK. All right. Thank you
very much, Maam. Thank you,
Senator.
Hey, Madam Floor leader
Skipanski.
Thank you, Madam Chair, Senator,
um, great to see you.
Uh, I appreciate a lot of what
is in this bill, particularly
Section 6, I think.
Uh, really clearly delineates.
Um
The requirements for individuals
with concealed carry licenses,
um.
My one issue that I want to
raise here, um, and I, I'm not,
I'd love to get your.
Feedback on this, Madam Chair
Senator, uh, is the quality of
the training, so.
One of my family members has a
concealed carry license and uh
frankly, the training uh.
That he has attended.
To receive the initial concealed
carry, and then the renewal was
basically a joke, you know, um,
and I was, I was really
discouraged because in this
building, we talk a lot about
how these individuals have
completed the training and um
that, that the training ensures
that they understand how to
operate a firearm, understand
how to load and unload and, and
there's also um some target
requirements and
Um, you know, individuals have
their licenses renewed who could
not shoot the target, who did
not know how a property,
properly load their firearm, did
not know, we're trying to fire
it with the slide open, um,
could not identify their firearm
when they were all placed back
on the table, um, you know, as
they do when each person is
taking their turn at the
practice, picked up the, the
wrong firearm and tried to leave
with it, uh.
And
that to me was extremely
concerning.
Um, because these are
individuals that, you know, we
specify in law.
That they need to meet certain
requirements in order to have
this, uh, which is great, but
there doesn't seem to be any
enforcement of that or any sort
of.
Quality auditing, and then in
addition to that, and then I,
I'd love to hear your thoughts,
Senator. In addition to that,
there was a lot of inaccurate
legal advice dispensed by the
instructor that was also
concerning because, you know,
then you have individuals who.
We are getting inaccurate advice
about
How they, uh, should it should
react in certain situations.
What might constitute
self-defense, other, uh, kinds
of legal advice that we
were quite inaccurate and so I
don't know, um, Madam, I'd love
to hear your thoughts on that,
um, Senator, Madam Chair, um,
and if there's a way to maybe
address that. Well, I'll give
you a little context and you'll
find this amusing, I think, and
when I attended my concealed
carry course, I had already been
the sponsor and had passed, for
example, the red flag law.
The 7 day waiting period.
Uh, the gun show loophole
legislation. I've carried a lot
of the major gun legislation,
gun safety legislation over the
last several years. So you can
imagine when I walk into a class
uh run by a gun dealer, trainer,
uh, and a room full of people
who are gun enthusiasts, right?
So when it came down to giving
uh inaccurate legal advice.
There was lots of that over the
two days and, and then of
course, um with good nature, I
took a lot of uh ribbing from
the instructors and others in
the.
room about uh people who were
trying to in any way restrict
Second Amendment rights, um, and
so you're, and, and as we know,
2nd Amendment issues are debated
here and we all disagree very
much about the interpretation
and the scope of all of that, so
you're right, um, there's,
there's gonna be that. The, the,
if you look on page 8 of the
bill, you'll see what is already
existing statutory language,
which just says the department
shall prepare and publish the
minimum standards for the
courses and the course shall
include the classroom
instruction and the range
instruction.
It goes on to say that 89, it
says an approved firearms
training course shall be
certified or sponsored by a
federal or state law enforcement
agency.
Um, or a college or a firearms
training school or nationally
recognized. So we've got a
number of people that can offer
the training.
And we're relying on the
department who's issued the
certificate uh or the license to
be um doing what you're
suggesting, representative, um,
and if they're not doing so, I'm
not addressing that in this bill
and it's probably something we
should be asking questions about
and bringing them in to ask them
what enforcement procedures they
have what auditing they do. I'm
sorry to hear about the
experience of your family member
that they consider this a joke
because, as I said, we were, we
were joined before the
representative. I, I put gun
owners into three categories in
my, my way of thinking, you've
got.
Lawful responsible owners, and
then you've got uh irresponsible
owners, those are the people who
maybe don't lock up their gun,
who maybe don't uh know where
it's at, uh, lose it, have it
stolen. They're, they're not uh
responsible gun owners,
irresponsible gunners, and then
the third category is criminals.
You have people who are just
gonna be criminals with their
use of guns. We're never, we're
not going to attack the
criminals in this bill, but what
I'm trying to do is see a
greater shift from the
irresponsible gun owners into
their responsible gun.
Madam Chair and senator, yeah, I
would really love to.
Increase the
I, I'm not sure if they need to
maybe submit more evidence of
the
Person's, um,
Passage of the training, you
know, the, the fact that there
were individuals who could not.
hit the target was concerning to
me, um.
And I don't know what, what
evidence is required to
demonstrate that a person has
competently gone through the
training, um, I also think the
department should be
Visiting these trainings and
understanding, you know, whether
it's a spot check or or.
Um, some kind of audit to, to
really understand because, you
know, these are individuals that
will
Have these firearms on their
person or in their home, um,
with kids, uh, one of, one of
the folks was a.
was a grandmother who was
interested in protecting her
children, um, could not hit the
target, you know, and I'm
thinking about those kids, um,
so, so, Madam Chair, uh,
Senator.
I, um, you know, I appreciate
that some of the strengthening
that's in here.
Um
And I, I would love to work with
you on, on talking to the
department about.
how they can improve the quality
of the training, um, and
potentially strengthen that, you
know, page 9, we have.
Uh, they, the, every instructor.
Of an approved firearms training
course she'll annually file a
copy of the course description
and proof of certification with
the department, but there's not
really any requirement that the
department do anything with
that. It's really, um, but we've
got to, if we're going to
Reduce the number of hours of
training that we've got to even
doubly ensure that what the
content is.
is creating responsible firearm
owners.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair,
Senator. Thank you. I look
forward to working with you on
that. I, um, I spent 3 hours
last night on the call of the
Senate. You may have heard some
of the details about that too.
We, we, and, and it's a gun
related uh effort that I'm
making under the unfair trade
practices Act trying to expand
the use of the unfair trade
practices for some of these
things too, because the, the
what we're trying to do is, as
we know earlier this session
we've all passed together and
the governors signed, for
example, the Glock switch, um,
modi modifier and that makes it
illegal to possess these things.
Now by our bill last night,
we're trying to get to the
manufacturers and the sellers
and the online sellers of those
products as well too, so there's
a lot of room here, uh,
representative, and you're
right, we should bring in DPS,
the, the, the reason I bring up
the point of last night is the
one thing that I find most
deplorable is the fact that we
put law enforcement out on the
streets every day to uh to keep
us safe and they're outgunned,
um, badly outgunned by their
adversaries and the, the idea
that we allow automatic weapons
on the streets.
And police officers have to
confront that every day should
be the greatest concern I think
we have. We should never have
our, our criminal element better
armed than our law enforcement.
Madam Chair, Senator, um,
Yeah, I'm not, I, I, I like very
much a lot of this bill, um, you
know, I still have that
outstanding in the training, um,
but I'll look forward to.
OK, next I have Representative
Lujan and then Representative
Zamora and then represented
Berego and then we will call
roll.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um, so
my
One of my questions was, um,
discussed and I won't belabor
that on the, the training
because I, I do believe that
that.
Needs to be addressed and if we
are
We're gonna bring in those that
are going to set up the program
and um hearings. I think that
that.
That's, I, I, I, that's what I'm
hearing, um, Madam Chair,
Senator, that's how you would.
Um, acknowledge or maybe look to
improve what the quality of that
training is, is that correct?
Madam Chair Representative, yes,
the, the, the bill doesn't try
to address that issue and, and I
hadn't thought of that being a
concern that
Um, that was expressed earlier,
but it's a good question, and I
haven't given it any thought to
how we oversee that to make sure
that's being done right, but the
bill doesn't change any of those
requirements now.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um,
thank you, Senator. Um, I'm, I'm
looking to at the, the removal
of discretionary state authority
to transfer a recognized
reciprocity of concealed handgun
licenses. I believe that's on
page 10.
Rather than it has that
something that, is that a
provision that has been
In place and this or this is
going to be new law.
Um, madam chair center, so what
you're seeing is section 5 that
begins on page 9 and then can
see cons over the page then and
that, that's all essentially uh
existing statutory language.
Thank you, thank you, Madam
Chair. Um.
We're just, I'm just reading two
different things, I guess, um,
that is, you're, you're not
inaccurate. You'll see a change
on online for page 10. It really
strikes just the one word of
transfer. So we're not, we're
not talking, we're talking about
recognizing a license in another
state, but not allowing a
transfer. So that's why we're
striking the language transfer.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator. My last question
is if, um,
If somebody is found guilty, if
you will, on any of the of
Of um
Against the law that we're we're
trying to enact here, they would
be um
Charged with a misdemeanor or a
petty misdemeanor, Adam Chair.
So, madam chair, the language
that relates to misdemeanor and
petty mister is the unlawful
carrying without a concealed
carry permit. So, so that,
that's the the right now, um,
again, if you, if you chose to
carry a weapon without a
concealed carry permit, you're
subject only to a petty
misdemeanor. And so, as I said,
some people just don't bother
with it because it's such a
small penalty, so we're
increasing the penalty for not
carrying a concealed carry
permit to the, to the um to
misdemeanor. The, the question
you're asking is, if you violate
the
Conditions of the issuance, then
the, the remedy there is not the
misdemeanor. That's, that's a
different crime. In other words,
the, the crime that's in here is
just simply carrying or not
carrying without, without a
permit. But if you violate the
conditions of the permit, then
the license becomes subject to
revocation.
For that clarification, Madam
Chair, um,
And there are a lot of things in
here I like, I think you're
moving in, moving in the right
direction with, with a lot of
this, but that's all I have,
Madam Chair. Thank you.
Representative Zamora.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, Senator, for bringing this
forward. So I'll kind of start
at the end of my question, then
we can back it up if we need to
to go backwards on it.
On page 13 line 6 at the top of
the, I mean, line one.
Uh, section 6, it says the
licensee is no longer a
full-time salaried law
enforcement officer.
It says you must return the
license.
Am I reading that correct,
Senator. So it's important for
you to probably go back, um,
To
See where this begins.
Maybe I should have started
started on, on, on 12 at line
11H. That's right. Section H,
right? And, and this gets back
to the last questions that I was
being asked as well too. What,
what disqualifies you from?
Having a a concealed carrying
license. The reason that you're
looking at that uh license no
longer full-time salary is we
made an exemption to having to
have a concealed carry permit.
So if you're a full-time
salaried law enforcement
officer, you're obviously able
to carry a firearm without
having to go through a concealed
carrier or having a concealed
carry permit. So we make it that
exemption for law enforcement.
If you're no longer a full-time
law enforcement officer, then
you should lose that exemption
and that's the language you're
looking at. Again, um, um, that
would all be.
Um, like I said, kind of
consistent with the other list
of conditions. So if you look at
that if you're if you're
adjudicated mentally
incompetent, there's any number
of the other qualifiers that
begin right under that
subparagraph H. I got you. So,
it was just kind of confused me
when I read section H. I
thought,
That they had a license, but
the, where is the license the
exemption.
So
I'm sorry sorry about that,
Madam Chair and senator.
Do they have actually have a
license that says they're
exempt. Is that what it is,
Madam Chair and Representative,
no, that wouldn't be required
again, the way the the the law
exists now if you're, if you're
a full-time salaried law
enforcement officer, you're not
required to have a concealed
carry permit, OK? It's a little,
it's a little confusing just but
that that makes obvious sense,
right? You, you, we're not gonna
require law enforcement to go
through a concealed carry and
have a permit. They're, they're
naturally gonna be concealed
carry weapons anyway, but if
they, once they're no longer
employed in that capacity, they
should no long
longer be entitled to that
exemption.
Madam Chair, that concludes my
questions, and if there's nobody
else on the board, I'd like to
move a dupe.
Thank you, Representative
Zamora. I have represented a
Madam Chair.
Um
Excuse me.
I know Breo.
I didn't know if they were
making a motion still, Madam
Vice Chair made a motion for a
due pass. OK.
Um, thank you, uh, Madam Chair
and senator. So just
A couple of quick quick
questions on page 8,
on the back to the training.
So a certified trainer could
still have training for 15 hours
if they wanted to because it
says not less than 6.
So if they to address.
The thought that I, that I heard
from the person online who is a
certified trainer, um.
They could still have a 15 hour
course if they wanted to.
Madam chair, that's an excellent
point. I hadn't thought of, but
you're absolutely right. Uh,
that, that's up to the trainer.
They're, they're the ones who
are gonna have to certify the
individual and if to use the
other example if somebody
couldn't hit a target, the
trainer would presumably either
keep them for more time, more
hours, or else not certify them,
but you're right, they could,
they could demand more than the
minimum.
OK, and Madam Chair and, and
Senator, um, on page 12, where
you talk about, um, involuntary
license, it's number 3.
Under section.
I guess it's section 6.
it talks about the license has
been involuntary licensee has
been involuntarily committed to
a facility for the treatment of
addiction, alcohol controlled
substances or other drugs.
Um
If a person commits themselves
or can they still carry?
Madam chair, so if you look back
at this, this is the, the, uh,
the question that was being
raised earlier, if you look back
at that beginning of that
section, which is on line 11.
says a licensee within 2 days
shall notify the department in
writing when certain events
happen. So as I said, your law
enforcement officer and you're
no longer a law enforcement
officer, you're required to
notify the department of that so
in the example you're giving if
an individual has been
involuntarily committed for a
treatment of mental health,
they're in their licensee,
they're required to notify the
department of that circumstance,
um, and presumably the
department will then act on that
on that knowledge, probably
revoked the license.
OK. Um,
I'm just, I'm a little bit
confused about that, Madam Chair
and senator. So, um,
If a person has involuntary
involuntarily, meaning that they
are
Prescribed, I guess in a sense,
um, to.
To have some sort of treatment,
then
And so I'm asking if they, if
they commit themselves, then are
they still required to do this?
Um, Madam Chair, and Senator,
that's a good question that I
don't know his answered in the
bill as a, as a practical
matter, I think we all recognize
the impro improbability of
somebody who's involuntarily
committed for mental health or
substance abuse, they're
probably not thinking that they
need to notify the department
that their license has been or
or they should notify the
department that their license
may be subject to revocation,
probably not gonna do it.
They're probably not.
Going to comply with this, but
we put the requirement in place
so that if the department then
learns that they've been subject
to these conditions they'll
revoke the license for the
failure to comply with this
requirement. OK.
All right, thank you Madam Chair
and thank you, senator.
You. All right, we have a motion
for do pass by Vice Chair Little
and a second by Representative
Zamora.
Do we have any opposition?
See none, you have a due pass,
Senator. Thank you.
I vote, uh, what is it? 9 to 0.
Yeah.
Hey
Let's move along the Senate Bill
63, our last bill for the
morning.
Good morning,
Madam Chair,
thank you all for taking time to
hear, uh, Senate Bill 63, what
we're doing here is we want to
retire the New Mexico flag with
reverence.
And done the right way. This is
brought to me by a couple of
Girl Scout troops in my
particular area, I have gotten.
There was a request from uh
Senator Pinto that I contact
some of the pueblos and ensure
that it is in standing with what
they are wanting to have done,
and I have done that and uh
that's all we're asking, Madam
Chair, to retire the New Mexico
flag with reverence it deserves.
I will stand for questions.
You, Senator. Let's go to the
audience. Do we have anyone who
wishes to speak and support.
Any opposition? Let's go online
quickly. Anyone hoping to speak
in favor of Senate Bill 63,
please raise your hand.
OK, sing Nan, is there anyone
who is hoping to speak in
opposition to Senate Bill 63.
Please raise your hand.
See you then, chair.
Madam Chair.
The motion by Representative
Lujan for DuP pass is seconded
by Rosa Block. Do we have any
opposition, seeing that you have
senator.
You guys are fantastic, thank
you.
We're meeting tomorrow at 11:00
