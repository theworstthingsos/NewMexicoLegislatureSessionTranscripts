In the budget.
Madam chair members of the
committee.
Twenty twenty each leadership
this was provided additional
money to supplement the schools
are critical tools and support
in the house members twenty
twenty one session the increase
all right twenty nineteen amount
is seventy five thousand one
hundred
I agree leadership offices.
The timing of the first for the
right in January the day session
begins created a challenge the
staff the PreSession funds.
Madam chair the red begin.
Recognizing that there would not
be enough money in the
PreSession budget to pay session
staff and mileage and per diem
for members.
It was decided that the staff
would be paid from the regular
session with funds that impacted
salaries and I.
Is approximately seventy
thousand from last week this.
Last year for the twenty twenty
session.
Madam chair members of the
committee that two officers also
reviewed.
Did the optimal amount of
printed provided by both New
Mexico state printed in the
house the publication.
Includes the LCS bill rule to
ensure that leads back to keep
the process moving as
efficiently as possible the
virtual aspect of the session
leads to a small cost despite
printed printed bills but it is
anticipated that some of the
possible shift in the house more
printed from staff printers
great until the project using.
You have before you the budget
that we could look at madam
chair.
The twenty nineteen session.
The twenty twenty one.
This is what.
Unemployment contributions if
you look at the twenty nineteen
sixty that request it was two
point six nine nine zero one
five.
Once in the twenty twenty one
due to all these
savings that we have it is one
point nine seven nine point
seven eight one and you can go
down Madam to get a lot all the
differences in the past
contractual services.
Other miscellaneous including
the board of commissions and
travel
madam chair I now stand for
questions.
Thank you representative
Representative.
Thank you.
Three or four requested Under
yes we know support insurance.
This is the year over year.
Part of that increase was a.
Madam chair representative
Crowder there is some kind of
formula the way GST determined
on that have it done and
actually the best person to
answer that would be and NASA
also noticing also from council
service or Raul Burciaga which I
understand are on soon.
Funds it.
Secretary Burciaga.
Yes.
Agencies Representative problem.
Yes on the.
Your personal service employee
contributions line five two one
six hundred employee liability
insurance premium.
Tereus wine you're over here.
It's gonna.
Here's what's called.
If we have less people here.
The.
Your love Mr Burciaga can you
hold for a second.
Have we figured a way to get
results with.
Okay.
Hi one second please.
Yeah.
hundred thirty services.
For thirty days in the sixty day
for.
To the liability insurance we've
got a new client call.
Services.
Two three so sharply.
So madam chair representative
Crowder the increase that.
Thirty two thousand is actually
a thirty thousand dollar
contract plus
plus gross receipt taxes and
that is to pay for a staff
person that is working part of
the analyst poll for one of the
leadership offices and that
amount has been subtracted from
the salaries
that are listed in the and the
call above so that it balances
out and that's the only reason
it's the money's just been.
It's a paying a regular salary
like you would for the rest of
the staff here it's just been
moved into a contract portion
because it appears to be yes Sir
yes Sir the.
Under printing and photographic
services.
This information there will be
for may
Hello this is decreased
considerably it is half of what
it was all in the last sixty
days.
And I wondered I know that we're
not going to do very much
predicting a fifty dollar.
you madam chair Representative
Crowder actually that printing
and photographic services also
includes the composite that we
normally do and because the
building is closed to the public
and we're not letting
individuals out in just to keep
us safe we're gonna hold off on
doing photograph and composites
to win we're in a more safer
environments which would be
maybe during the redistricting
session later on this year so
those to help them you guys will
still get a professional photos
done and we'll get a nice
composite it'll just be a time
when it's favor.
So.
For.
Yes Sir I and then also.
Information technology from M..
Madam chair representative that
is correct plus there have been
a couple of other I. T. pieces
that we needed to purchase
smaller but the biggest part was
the virtual voting council.
You're welcome thank.
We'll have you want to.
Representative of course yeah.
The person I was curious about
the four billion.
You year over year and this
consistently on additional ten
thousand dollars.
Areas for costs that increase.
Yes this is about the
The ability.
Yes understanding and we do
Chief financial officer on
unnecessary Espinoza my
understanding is that those are
massively get billed directly
by.
GSD and going to the budget is
that correct SO.
Madam chair representative yes
that's correct liability
premiums are assessed by DST's
mismanagement Division so
consciences increases happened
to us year after year depending
on circumstances and especially
if we have things in the
building sector.
This could have lost part.
Madam chair representative I can
To that
some of this is is retrospective
so I think sometimes we get
billed by GST after the fact so
this may include expenses that
we've been current but our our
for session point so we have to
put in that in that session
budget so we can pay for that.
Madam chair disappears once the
driver what's causing this
increase to go up.
Saying that in the insurance
world some wondered why isn't
happening in this bill.
Madam chair representative.
We don't the state does not
purchase insurance through any
commercial it is self insured
and it's based on losses workers
comp liability
anything that we self insure for
we have to pay directly so it
may not have gone up other
agencies may have gone up on
some it is it is bill took H.
our budget entity so in this
case of this amount was sent to
us by GSD and said this is how
much you all for
house of representatives it may
have been different for the
Senate may have been different
for council services we get
those amounts and we put them in
the respect the budget so that's
what we get that we're self
insured so we just get billed by
GSD risk management and put that
in the budget to pay for.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Mr Burciaga.
Okay.
Okay we representative Thompson
and the Representative Montoya.
Thank you madam chair I'm
actually it's along the same
lines I'm looking at the workers
comp and
my for I guess my first question
is is this just for section
employees or does this this
doesn't include like Legislative
Council
Kirk's office year round staff
this is just for and session
staff is that correct.
madam chair Representative
Thomson that that is correct
okay and then I just find it
interesting that it's gone up
and and it's it's with more in
the thirty day session that it
had been for the sixty day
session before and even though
we're down sixty employees it's
going to be more this year than
it was two years ago so can you
talk a little bit about that.
Madam chair representative and
I'm sorry I don't know that the
details at this is also a
question that role and New
Mexico Public Health or better
on that mechanism how it's done
so I apologize no that's okay I
just I was just curious.
Would you like to answer that.
Sure this is an asset I think
the question I was on the
workers comp premium might point
out that they have less people
in the building I understood
correctly correct that the
payments are actually built to
us at the beginning of the
fiscal year so we can build a
budget so it's not based on the
current situation that we have
right now so are these next year
maybe the.
So so madam chair is there is
there any method of repayment
for overpayment or anything like
that if if.
And in extension six
circumstances.
Madam chair representative no I
don't I don't believe so again
this is assessment test date and
they bill us based on on
information they have.
And right eight act.
Okay I think that's all I have
thank you madam chair.
Thank you very.
Representative Montoya.
Thank you madam chair I'm gonna
be back on Representative
Thompson's question
And
So Madam chair representative or
