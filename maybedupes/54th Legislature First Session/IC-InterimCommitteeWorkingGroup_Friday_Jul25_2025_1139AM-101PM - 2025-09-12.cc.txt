are not
The whole legislature. So there
have
There was an attempt at one time
to have symposia.
On hot button items, um,
For all of the legislature
during the interim.
And I don't think that
It didn't last very long, and I
really don't remember why.
Uh
The
The role of honors and
privileges.
Um
Also
Take up a big
position in interim committee as
well as and probably standing
committees too. Leaders bestow
the honors of chairships and
membership.
At least just as much or more.
Then topical expertise.
This bestowal has political
value for the honorer, and it
has emotional and perhaps
political value for the honoree.
The leg, the reason I'm bringing
this up is that the legislatures
Removal of these
are
Opportunities.
I
is a fraught condition. Um, it's
gonna, it would be controversial
it may be hard, whatever. It's,
it's not just gonna be smooth
sailing, uh, but it should be
possible to balance.
Um
Politics and effectiveness. And
I would think that perhaps
that's your goal.
With your work.
I want to note that there is
nothing in rule or in law that
requires a legislator to serve
on an interim committee.
Back in the, I want to say from
the 50s to maybe through the
80s, 1980s, uh.
There were not every member did
serve on a committee.
Part of that could have been
Because
Legislators maybe were a little
more realistic about
What their interim looked like
and how they were gonna balance
their work life.
Family life and their and their
legislative life.
And declined to serve or leaders
didn't pick them. The committees
were smaller and they had fewer
members and we have fewer
Uh, um
Smaller, I'm sorry, in that
smaller. There were fewer of the
committees and fewer members.
So
Um
I don't know, Senator Woods and
Senator Padilla, you write,
might remember Stewart Ingle
telling the story of when he
first came.
And the minority floor leader
who was me.
told him that he could not
expect to serve on an interim
committee at the beginning
because he didn't know enough.
And he, he always loved to tell
that story, so I think you
remember it.
Yeah
Yes, sir,
at some point.
There are 5 types of interim
committees.
The first is task-oriented.
Uh, no, actually, the first
one's permanent. So like,
The 3 permanent committees.
That we have counsel service,
LESC, and LFC. Then there are
oversight committees like NMFA
and MFA.
But if she oriented committees,
they're like CCJ.
Wrist up
Uh, I would put Health and Human
Services in that category of
issue orientation.
And task orientation, which is
This working group,
And the federal funds
stabilization.
Committee, uh, or the current
examples of what I think of is
really task-oriented.
And then there are special
committees.
Task forces are special
committees, and they differ.
Because generally they are
created by law.
They
Include both legislative and
public members and by public
includes executive members.
Um, and they are task-oriented.
They have a job to do, they do
it and they go away.
So they have an end date.
They, um,
Have may have appointing
authorities different from the
Legislative council.
They may have
Um
Um, the, the, the, yeah, I don't
know what I'm trying to say
here. Hold on. The um
As a general rule,
They usually have more
legislators than other members.
Because it is a legislative
activity and you don't want to
Overwhelm.
The
The legislators with executive
or
Public members.
The
The council service pays.
The per diem and mileage of all
members.
Not all, uh, except we do as a
general rule, we do not play for
executive members or any public,
any public agency member whose
agency pays for DM and mileage.
Uh
And they can, the
The citizen participants.
Can
refuse per deal. They don't have
to take it.
Legislators serves as chair.
Or may serve as a co-chair.
All of this is
Here to making sure that
The legislative independence is
maintained.
So the legislature is not going
to be holding to the other
members.
In, in a way that um they can
get kind of swept aside if there
are too many.
Non-legislators on a committee
or they are providing
Whatever,
um.
Their pay the executive was
paying for it. Actually, if the
executives paying for it,
legislators probably can't be on
it.
Doctor Alan Rosenthal, who was a
very well-known political
scientists and legislative
Um
Scholar.
Talks about the 4 important
factors.
Of committee performance and
success.
The first one is legislative
capacity.
And by that he means division of
labor, distribution of work,
organization, and resources.
And he says that
Of those factors that reflect
legislative capacity.
Professional staff is the most
crucial.
Staff support clearly and
substantially contribute.
To the optimal functioning and
the success of an interim
committee. Uh.
Statistically speaking, talking
about capacity.
Uh, I
One of phrases, there are more
things that are up now. The
number of interim committees,
the number of committee members,
the number of constituents, the,
uh, well, an advocates and um
lobbyists as well.
The number of bills, memorials,
resolutions that y'all deal
with.
Uh, also up is the unrelenting
blast of
Information and misinformation.
That you are
Inundated with.
This
And this part, this, this public
um
Um
The social media.
Uh, intensity.
It's probably leading to
increases in constituent demand
and expectation.
And now we have AI to contend
with, which is a whole different
story.
As Paula Packett said in a
presentation that she gave to
the 2002 uh subcommittee on
Legislative process and
procedure.
Quote, I am amazed you have any
time to give thought to the
responses and solutions that are
demanded of you. And that's
really true.
Um, I just want to acknowledge
that, that
Certainly staff is well aware of
all the demands on your time and
your attention.
The second factor is
characteristics of legislative
members.
And this means
Um, whether you're a senior or a
junior member.
Uh, how you view the committee
and its mandate.
What you're willing to do.
What kind of commitment you're
willing to make to the
legislature as an institution
and what your role is relevant.
Experiences.
Rosenthal makes the point that
in the development of public
policy and the oversight of
implementation of public policy.
There needs to be some memory.
Some continuity of service on
committees.
The 3rd is the effort made by
the committee.
Meeting with the committees work
seriously at their job, in
formulating policy or being
effective as an oversight.
Or role
The 4th is distribution of power
in the political system.
Meaning that performance relates
to political influence.
So that a committee is less
likely to perform its functions
well. If it does not have
political
Influence
And by
That, um, we're gonna look at
The endorsement history.
Of committees in the last
however many years.
They endorse a lot of bills.
And they don't get passed.
And that has to have some effect
on, on how members feel about
Participating in interim
committees.
Which may then have
Our relationship with attendant.
Committees seem to be more issue
oriented these days than they
used to be.
The national research seems to
indicate that tax, the
task-oriented committees are
more productive.
And have fewer quorum problems.
And
I don't know that I'm
Particularly suede.
By that, I'm not sure.
It shows up
But part of that is because we
have so few task oriented
committees to prepare.
The rise in these committees may
reflect the legislature's need.
Or, or it's sense that it is
required to know so much.
Um, it's got to make informed
policy decisions on a broader
range of issues, and it needs to
exercise greater oversight of
the implementation of those
policies.
The question is how best to get
that result.
Um
Nobody can act for the body.
But the body's got to know.
What's going on.
On pages 13 and 14.
Of the memo. Can y'all get to
Those pages.
There, OK, so it starts.
Let me get there.
Yes, it starts on page 13. This
is this.
This
13 and 14.
are selected years.
Looking at endorsements.
So you'll see in 2005 CCJ, for
example, endorsed 50 pieces of
legislation.
4 chaptered and 1 was vetoed.
So
For, so 5 passed out of 50.
In that same year, HHS endorsed
72 pieces of legislation. Two
bills were chaptered in one
memorial passed.
So when you look at that, you
can see this um
You can actually see in this
over time.
That in 2005 they were they were
endorsing a lot of bills.
And also in 2010. But then that
started to drop.
So in 15 there were only 3
committees introduced.
A large number of bills.
20
20 there was only one.
Actually, there was only one
committee that that endorsed.
In 21, there were only two
committees.
It endorsed 22.
One committee, 23, 2 committees,
241 committee. So
It it looks to me like
Negative reinforcement.
Works. They were not
Being paid attention to, they
weren't getting um
They were passing the bills that
they endorsed. So either they
got more selective over time or
they just said we're not doing
this.
So
So now if you look on pages 16
through 20. This is a table
about qualms and about
attendance.
And I realized after I did this,
That
Um
I did a little bit screwy. I
apologize because I put 2024 1st
and then I put 23 and 22, and I
should have reversed those. I
don't know what I was thinking
about.
But anyway,
Um, what you're gonna see
is
We've got boating in a and
advisory members, the number of
meeting days.
The days when there was a quorum
issue when they couldn't come up
with a, with a uh quorum of the
voting members. They either had
to go in, um, had to become a
special subcommittee or
I'm
I know that it's happened.
Somewhat in the past, I didn't
look to see how often it happens
now that
Members, because they can't come
up with a special subcommittee.
The members who came to this
meeting will not get paid for
per diem.
That is one of the problems it
may not, it may not happen
anymore then may be ways to find
legislators to show up.
Ah
And I'm sorry, and I'd be happy
to look at that if you would
like me to. So,
Attendance.
I mean
Um
I just want to say, I want to
You say like most groups.
Interim committees have a
culture. They have a subculture.
And
In order to work effectively,
they have to have some cohesion
or camaraderie that is built
around the group itself. So when
a tendance is not happening when
it's inconsistent.
That affects
How the committee operates. I, I
don't want to sound too woo woo,
but um it, it has some kind of
psychological effect, I believe,
and I think I'm worn out in some
research.
I didn't just make this up.
Uh, anyway,
When you look at these tables.
You can see
Like in 24.
That's
coffee here, this is.
You see that land grant in
public school capital outlay.
Had a problem with
Getting quorums.
But if you look at this absent
50% or more of the time.
Line
Lots of advisory members.
are not attending.
Science and tech, step, step,
interestingly, cause I thought
that would have been a very well
attended committee.
Um
Public school capital outlay
oversight.
And economic and rural
development all had problems
with
With um having
Attendance by.
Um
Advisory members.
Uh, also water.
Interesting, the legislative
council.
That was a surprising number to
me that um
Out of 16 advisory committees,
11.
Were there
I, um,
missed.
Half or more.
Of council meetings.
And the council doesn't even
have her many meetings.
The education committee.
It had 22.
Advisory members and 20.
We're absent half or more of the
time.
And even legislate Finance
committee, which has a really
good track record of attendance
of its members.
But not necessarily of its
advisory. And I did not do
designees on either elepsy or
rest step because designees are
only
There when they are designated
to take the place of a member.
So it really is to, to look more
like apples and apples.
I left designees out.
In 23.
Economic development, land grant
again.
NMFA public school capital
outlay again.
Water and natural resources
again.
Having trouble coming up.
With
Attendance that is going to lead
to some kind of
Um
Effective
Then uh.
No,
let's not go there. Um, let's
say functioning, effective
functioning.
In 22 land grants, NMFA.
Radioactive and hazardous, rural
economic, which is
was the old name for
Um, economic and rural
development.
Science and tech
So
Somewhere along the line,
Beer
is a disconnect from
Legislators saying they want to
serve.
And serving.
Travel is another sticky issue
about interim committees.
Many legislators
I think that it's important to
take the legislature to the
people.
Um, and I'm not making any
judgment about any of this, by
the way.
Others think travel.
Makes it harder.
To attend
in on base.
State agencies on the other
hand.
Maybe be pretty ambivalent about
Having to
Present to multiple committees
essentially on the same topic.
Um, though the big committees
like um health.
Um
The healthcare authority.
Um, not corrections particularly
let's just use those twos and
they're, they're gonna be,
they're gonna have to go to LFC
several times probably. They're
gonna have to go to HHS.
And maybe some other committee
is some interested in some
Portion of health of human
services that they're going to
have to attend to.
So
It's not just
Whether the members are showing
up.
It's
What kind of participation you
can get from executive agencies
and other experts.
If you remember,
Um, we have had governors.
Who have said,
Nobody's traveling to your
committees.
Well, actually, even if you were
in this, if you were in the
In Santa Fe.
They just weren't allowing.
Executive agencies to appear
before interim committees.
Which really
I mean, what do you do with
that?
How do you learn?
If
The executive is not cooperating
with you.
So duplication of effort is also
a problem.
And
both for attendance, for
Burn out
What happens
Quite frequently. It's said LFC
will hear a topic that belongs
to another interim committee.
And so by the time the interim
committee gets around to doing
it.
The members who
Or on an LFC or have
I have
Gone to LFC. I already know it.
But they know it from a slightly
different angle, perhaps.
And
If they're not, and they go, oh,
I'm not going to that meeting.
I've already heard that.
Maybe
They heard it from a different
angle than what the interim, the
other interim committee wants to
be discussing. So that gets
missed. It's so,
There goes
Whatever. Anyway, duplication is
not efficient.
Nor do I think it's effective.
Efficiency is not the goal.
Of the legislature. I am a firm
believer with Paula on this.
Because legislating is serious
business.
And you want
No, but you, you shouldn't want
laws to be passed.
Quickly
Needs deliberation, whatever.
And what is that expression
about, um,
Seeing legislation in sausage
being made.
Well, yes.
It's a grinding process, but
It's inherent if, if you're
trying to go, OK, so you, you
know, you have lobbyists every
year, you have lobbyists,
newspaper articles.
All these people yammering
about, oh, the legislature's
just wasting time.
No bill. It's in my 52 years
studying the legislature. No.
Bill has ever unintentionally
not passed because members
introduced their constituents in
the chambers are in the
Gallery
Or
Talked about a bill that was
going to name
The orange cone, the state
thing, whatever, you know,
whatever the new
state thing will be.
It doesn't happen.
It all has to
Happened otherwise. You have to
build majorities or consensus.
You have to build
Um
You have to know how much money
you're willing to spend outside
of the budget. They're all these
decisions that have to be made.
You have to know how many horses
you have.
You have to be able to count the
votes.
Which means you have to get the
boat.
So that takes time. And so why
shouldn't you be introducing
constituents.
And having special days.
lauding people who are worthy of
lying.
It's not wasting time. It just
irritates me every year when
that starts.
Going around and, and I just
I was
Yeah, serious work y'all are all
working at it.
OK, when you look at quorums
absenteeism and endorsement
statistic. The question arises,
I think this is pretty simple.
Well
Or these canaries in the coal
mine, really. And I sort of
think that's your charge, right?
To, to look and see if they are
canaries in the coal mine. Is
there
A better, more effective way to
do the things at interim
committees.
Ideally do education.
Deep diving.
And making recommendations.
Is there, is there a better way
than is currently being
Hammered out.
Almost every, well,
Let's not counting the big
states like California and New
York.
In Illinois.
Uh,
most committees, most
legislatures.
Have some kind of interim
committee, whether it's they
have standing committees that
operate in the interim or
whether they have special
interim committees like
We do.
It is time that cannot be,
cannot, you probably can't
afford not to spend to
be able to vote.
In an informed way when it gets
to when bills get to the floor.
So some kind of interim
Um, organizations have to
happen.
Is this
The way that works the best.
That's your chart, I believe.
And I don't envy you that charge
because it's gonna be really
hard.
So
Also in the, in the uh towards
the end.
Out of this written, the memo,
if you'll look on page 22.
Have the memo that starts
The findings and recommendations
of the subcommittee, the 2002
subcommittee. And then on page
28
Are the recommendations of the
07.07 clearly built.
On the work of the 02 committee.
Which actually built
On some of the work that
happened in the 90s and I, um, I
was gonna look this up and I
can't, I know that there was an,
an organizational um
A reward committee.
Set up
In the 90s.
And
So some of what happened in the
90s. I think there was some
effort in the 80s.
There have been a lot of
attempts.
To look to see what can be done.
To make interim committees more
effective.
But the 02
The way it was structured,
I think came out with some
really good
Findings
And some really good.
Recommendations and then 007.
Took that
And
So there is some overlap. That's
pretty much what I have to say.
I'm willing, I'm happy to do
however you want, if you want me
to answer questions if you wanna
just
Talk amongst yourselves or
whatever.
Thank you.
I've got some questions, I'm
real shy as you all know.
Um
I assuming we're all gonna have
some questions, but
Um, mind if I just jump in,
guys? OK.
Thank you, Janelle. That was
fantastic, by the way. I, I, I
feel like I got caught up to
good job, Jared. I think I know
what you meant by let's look at
this first. So good, good. Thank
you. Smart move.
Um
I'm just gonna post some
questions, Janelle, and maybe
you can, or somebody can kind of
look for this kind of stuff if
it's all right, um.
One is the states that allow for
standing committees to operate
year-round. Is it just for
debate, um, no action or maybe
there's some endorsement there
for the session.
I, I, I'm interested in that.
Um, and then second, are those
states doing it that way because
of the length of their regular
session.
So I'm guessing that the regular
session is really compact, so
they really need this kind of
time.
I don't know why I'm appearing
on the screen twice, but this is
pretty cool. Um,
So
OK.
So, my hands aren't moving as
fast as
OK.
So would it be would be great to
know is it just for debate
purposes and endorsement or is
it because their sessions are
really compact, so they need to
get work done ahead of time.
Any thoughts there?
Uh, I
Uh, um, I would just, I was
gonna say, Mr. Chairman or Madam
Chair and.
We should probably elect the
chair and the vice chair
Senator.
Um
The
They're mostly
Because rather than creating
interim committees, they just
extend the time of the standing
committees. And I have a list in
the memo of the states that have
that provision that you standing
committees in the interim.
And I did not look at the length
of their session.
There are 3 who that I know are
full-time legislators,
legislatures.
It, it might be
interesting to do that for you.
Thank you. It might be
interesting, Janelle, to take a
look at that because um I like
the idea.
Uh, and then design maybe uh
instead of interim committees,
it's just a thought, guys.
Everyone is designed
subcommittees off of those.
Standing committees that meet
year round, and that's where
sort of the funnel may
potentially come from.
Um, with the
Just my two cents there.
Um
There's that one.
Um
When you were sort of doing the
analysis on the advisory and
could they make quorum and the,
you know, the, uh, sorry, the
interims and, and could they
make war and this and that.
I mean, you know, I guess it's
OK for advisory to be absent
because I don't know that that's
a factor because that's why
you're an advisory and not, not
uh, uh, one of the reasons
you're an advisory and not a
voting member there. So I'm not
quite sure if that's even, if
that's an issue, but that's just
my take on it.
Um
In the years that you
demonstrated that there was a
reduction in, in endorsed and
passed legislation. I wasn't
surprised to, to see that.
And the reason I say that is,
um,
I think that there was a big
change. I was there, Pat was
there.
I don't know if a Day and, and
Alan were were in the
legislature at the time, but
Pat, you'll probably recall 2
years after you and I uh came to
the legislature, the, uh, the
Republicans took over the House
for the first time in 60 years,
if I recall. And I'm guessing
that maybe there was some
reorganization that had to
happen there. And then, of
course, there's just the, the
philosophical way we operate is
You know, Dems, R's, you know,
independence, whatever. So I
don't know if that's a trend
because that could have
naturally happened anyway, but
just kind of how I saw that.
Um
In terms when you said that some
of the that there were all of
these days that were lacking
quorum versus the number of days
meeting.
Did
I, I don't, I can't imagine they
were just lacking quorum and
they could do no, they couldn't
pay their members per diem or
they could not.
Act on anything because what,
what was it also that the pro
tem and the speaker deputized
advisory members that were there
so they could actually conduct
some business.
Yes.
If, if everything worked out. I
was just raising the point that
that is the downside of
Of inconsistent attendance that
can be
What happens is that if they
can't find anybody. Not every
committee has
Uh
They're committees that have
only a few.
Advisory members.
But that would, that would
happen. You would not get paid
if you could not make an a
special subcommittee.
That's, that's the council rule.
But the chair and the staff
director that's staffing the
committee that day could
Make a call out and say, hey,
you know, pro tem and, and
speaker, I have.
2 senators here and 3
representatives, you know, can
you deputize them so that we can
get some work done here.
Right. They have to belong to
the same political party.
And the same house. And I think
Jared, I think he does that on a
daily basis during the interim.
And Jarek can talk more about
that.
Honesty
I think that's a big part of why
this working group exists is
because
Pretty much daily, I text you to
the speaker or the pro tem.
I just preface it with today's
quorum issue, and I need you to
appoint so and so as voting, and
I think
I think they're going a little
tired of that, and, and that's a
part of why this exists. There
is a growing sense that the
interim.
is perhaps not as effective as
it could be. But that's a big
part of it too, is, is, is
quorums or lack thereof. So
it's, it's an issue.
OK. And I, I get it. I, I, I, I
can imagine what sort of a
three-ring circus you're
managing there. So thank you for
the work you're doing there,
but, but again, you know, we set
these things up in a certain
manner for a reason, and we
should try to adhere to the, to
the
The the the design.
Until we change that design as
much as possible. Um, I'm sure
the other members have some
stuff, but I want to throw one
last thing out here then, and
I'm gonna have a lot more
questions, uh.
Senator
I just want to make one point.
The um
The idea, I'm not telling
anything about the idea about
standing committees operating in
the interim. It would require a
constitutional amendment.
OK.
And that was actually my next
point, um, uh, uh, thank you so
much for that because
I guess as we go through this
conversation, everybody, I'm
hoping
That someone is paying attention
to the Constitution while we're
debating and making
Well, when, when we put our
recommendations together, we
probably need to make sure we're
not gonna run afoul of anything
in the Constitution that we
recommend to the full
legislative council, which we're
all constitutional members of.
So, that was the last thing I
want to mention. I'm sure I'm
gonna come up with about 58
other questions, but I'll stop
talking for now. I think the
other members have comments and
questions.
I've got a question.
Or
Of all the members of the
legislature,
For every one of them designated
as least uh meant one voting
member or of one interim, in
other words, every member of the
legislature.
As each one of those guys got at
least one.
Committee, they are voting
member of.
Do we have members in the
legislature that do not attend.
Any interim committees.
Which I don't guess it's a
requirement to do that.
Yes, sir. That is the um, do you
mean as they
A member can decline to serve.
A leader can just
Side not to put someone on a,
um,
A member might say, OK, I know
what my schedule's like it's
gonna be crazy. I
I would like to be an advisory
rather than a voting member.
Um, and so they're made, but I'd
be happy to look at that.
And
Greater detail. I didn't look at
that. I only looked at um this
last column.
On the attendance.
table shows you the me, the
number of members.
He did not show up at all on a
particular committee.
What I'm getting at, you know,
we are a
A volunteer legislator, and that
means that
Most of us hold down some kind
of a job somewhere.
And it may be just impossible to
take off that much time from
your job to to travel to an
interim or to attend in the
interim.
So,
I don't know if that should be a
factor on, on, I mean, as, as
far as if, if you agree to be a
voting member.
I would think that would pretty
well.
Make you or require you to be
there.
Or to find someone to serve in
your place.
One or the other. Something
comes up.
But I don't know if that
Mm.
I don't know if that can be.
Put into a
Policy or not.
But that, that should be.
Especially to make a quorum.
Right. And I have no idea.
What the leaders
As
Their members when they're
thinking about who's gonna serve
on what committee. I don't know
what they're asking them.
Y'all would know.
Well, if I could just, if I
could just piggyback on that
point. So I think this presents
an interesting issue, which is
kind of the push pull dynamic of
having a uh a voluntarily uh a
voluntary participation model
for the interim versus having
advisory members of each interim
committee, I think what is
happening just based upon
anecdotal evidence is that you
have voting members who I think
do have uh sustained more of an
obligation or
feel they have more of an
obligation to attend. However,
you have uh other advisory
members who are kind of saying,
well, I'm just advisory, I'm
sure someone else will show up
and then, you know, no one ends
up showing up and while I
completely understand why,
please forgive the airplane
flying above, um, I completely
understand why it it means a lot
for us to get out into the
community. I think that some
committees like LFC have to get
out to the committee. I have to
get out to the community because
they are
seeking out information that is
relevant to those particular
committees, but I think there
are other committees that just
travel for the sake of of
traveling and what makes that
difficult for those of us that
hold down, you know,
40 hour a week jobs is, um, you
know, you, you, it's harder to
get to some of these
communities, and then when
you're in a position like um
Jared and LCS is all the time
trying to call members to see if
you can make quorum, uh, you're
gonna have a lot better chance
if you are meeting in Santa Fe
at the Capitol cause there were
going to be other things going
on, you can find other members
than you would if you're meeting
somewhere like, you know, uh,
Solar City, and so I, I think
that that is part of it, and I
also want to mention.
I, I know that people are gonna
groan when I mention this, but I
really think that we can't have
this conversation in a
meaningful way, uh, and I think
one of the reasons why these,
these reports keep on getting
put in a drawer and shelved
after they happen, we cannot
have this conversation in a
meaningful way without
discussing professionalization
of the legislature, because it's
really hard to manufacture again
an obligation for people to show
up to an interim if
It's voluntary and not
considered part of a
legislator's duty, um, and, and
so I just wanted to make that
statement and and lastly uh
Janelle, thank you so much for
the information. I just have one
question for you, um,
Earlier, and thanks for the
attendance records. Jarrett's
really great, but earlier, do
you remember the interim
committees having more of a an
executive oversight function,
meaning they utilize the
subpoena power more often to
have uh agency heads come and
report to the legislature,
particularly as it relates to
implementation of bills that had
been passed in the session
before?
Subpoena power, the
The council had subpoena power
or no, look, I'm wrong.
Investigating committees had
subpoena power.
And then,
We have stopped doing those kind
of independent investigating
committees basically. This was,
these were committees that were
investigating.
Election problems or um problems
at the penitentiary, the boys'
school and the girls' welfare
home. These were kind of
serious um re responses.
And they had subpoena power.
The cos
was offered the opportunity back
in the day.
to being a power.
And
It decided not to. They gave the
subpoena power to LFC. So if the
legislature needs
Uh, to
Start issuing subpoenas.
We can do it through LFC.
Thank you, but LFC doesn't have
its own attorney, correct? They
share an attorney with other
agencies and is does that not
create a conflict of interest of
some sort?
Well, you know, we, we serve all
the committees, we serve all the
legislators the council service
does. Uh, so they can always
come to the council service
because we have an office full
of attorneys, uh, they
They used to, for example,
Rachel Godel was a lawyer.
When she was an LFC analyst.
Um
They have had analysts who were
lawyers, but it's not generally
what they're looking for.
OK, I'm gonna have a lot of
questions too. I actually have
to jump off cause my computer is
overheating. I'm gonna go take
it inside, get some power on it,
and I'll see you guys in a
second. Thanks.
Uh, I, I, I have a couple of
questions. So,
I don't know if it's the
internet here in in Sanba
County, but
It's
Freezing on me every little bit,
uh, Senator Padilla, you, when
you were talking earlier, you um
You're making a point on the
Difference between how the how
the Republicans in the house.
did things
In, in how the Democrats have
done thing, I kind of missed
that whole.
Line of of thought.
You kind of just say it again.
Yeah
And, and maybe calling it
Democrat and Republican, and
how, how things operated was not
Exactly what, what the intent
was, but when you haven't had
the role of managing the, the,
the
The session or the interim for,
you know, 60 years, you've got
to kind of learn how to do all
that, and you've got to get into
the groove of doing that. So I
think that that might have
shrunk the amount of bills being
considered for endorsement and
whatever in the interim process.
I'm, I'm, I'm guessing that
that, you know, cause there was
a, those of us that were here, I
mean, obviously, and, and, and
Pat, you chime in if you want
to, cause you and I came in on
the same day, 13 years ago, um.
You know, we, I, I noticed a
real noticeable change. I was in
leadership at that point, uh, as
well as the whip. I was the whip
at that time on the Senate side.
The session felt very different,
and I know the interims felt
different for those that
two-year period. And so I'm
guessing that's all it was. It
was just simply.
You know, and then, and then
flipping back to the Dems when,
when they took over two years
later, that was also a very
clunky process.
Uh, as well.
And, and so that, that's what
that was.
OK. Um, uh, thanks. I, I
appreciate that clarification.
Um, I, I, I really appreciate
all the information that, that
you've provided us, um, I did
have a question. Has there ever
Been a committee that has been
as an interim committee that's
been eliminated.
Yes, sir.
There have been in they should
have been eliminated. They, uh,
in fact, we are, if you, if you
don't count the 3 committees
that I don't consider to be
interim committees.
Um, in the regular
Way of eating throughout the
interim.
Um
We went down one from 24, didn't
we, Jarrett? Did we?
Yes.
Was it was.
There was a subcommittee that we
eliminated. I don't remember the
name of it.
council service did that.
We had a couple of economic
development focused committees,
if I recall.
And I think one of those went
away, uh, Jared, is that
accurate? If I, I seem to recall
that.
That's correct. So,
Representative Martinez's
question.
It's a little trickier, council
created committees and
subcommittees kind of come and
go, and it, and it ebbs and
flows and kind of hovers around
the twenty-ish, low twenties
from time to time. Statutory
committees are a little bit
trickier to get rid of, but
it's, it's happened. Um, I think
the 2007 group,
Recommended the elimination of
the welfare reform Oversight
Committee. And if you look at
the list that are in the share
files, I think, and I was gonna
try to find it, um, and I, I can
share it in a moment, but
The short answer is yes.
But
It's kind of like playing whack
a mole. We get rid of comedies,
but then the next gen rolls
around and, and then we create a
couple more.
So it's, it's, it's a continuing
issue.
And it's mostly the
task-oriented committees that
have a, a particular job, they
have 1 to 3 years to get
interims to get it done. They do
it, and they go away. Like, um,
The
Uh, public school funding
formula task force.
It was a 3-year committee.
Made its final report, and come
up with a new formula.
And it went away. The um
Actually, most of the studies
that I did and I didn't bring my
list uh.
But
those committees do go down.
The
The issue committees
are a little harder and talking
about one of the economic
development, I think.
What happened is
that it got
Uh, combined with rural
development.
As the original committee was
the world committee. I was on
that one, and I was on the other
one too, and I said to myself,
why do we have both of these
exactly?
Right.
But you also
you know, you have economic
development, which is a
statewide concept and also
looking at rural.
And
Are those
Two things have copacetic are
those two things?
And then, and then the original
iteration, because I chaired it
for 10 years, I learned a lot
about that committee, the
Science, Technology, and telecom
Committee, Representative
Martinez, that was originally
based on the Los Alamos, um, uh,
work up there, and then it
became and then another
committee called, uh, it was
called something else.
And then they threw all that out
at the time and they created one
committee to oversee, you know,
Science, technology, and
telecom, whatever it is.
In that one committee.
That's correct. There was the
information technology oversight
committee and the Los Amos
National Lab.
Oversight committee, which kind
of got morphed into the science
and Technology Committee. So
that's correct. And again,
It happens and, and we get rid
of one, but then just as quickly
we create another one.
Because I, I, I think some of
these committees
Or extremely relevant.
Um, with the
The speed at which technology
is, is
Expanding, I think, you know,
the science and technology
committee is, is very relevant.
I think one of the tasks that
this
Um
That this subcommittee needs to
look at is the relevance.
What we're trying to accomplish,
I mean,
Um
I, I, I don't know that I'm
ready to start.
Reading off a list of some of
these interim committees that
Have kind of run their course,
but
Uh, I think that's one of the
reasons why that that uh
Attendance is down. You have to,
you have to kind of prioritize.
I mean, even those of us that
aren't working.
40 hours a week at a job.
I mean, you know, my wife jokes
around that I'm busier now than
when I was getting a paycheck.
So there's a, there's a certain
prioritization of
Of time
And, and focus.
Um
I mean, right now I'm a member
of 9 different committees.
I would love to to be able to
attend every single one of them,
there's overlap on, on a lot of
these committees.
Um, and my first two years, I
was like running ragged trying
to
Make sure I attended every
possible committee, um, and
then, you know, there's, there's
things that come up, there's
health issues that need to be
dealt with. There's life issues
that need to be dealt with.
I remember in 2023, I broke my
leg.
And I'm driving around the state
for a month before I got in to
see a surgeon.
So
You know, there
There's a lot of different
factors.
But I think one of the key
factors that we need to look at
as members of this committee is
What's the relevance of this
committee? Are they putting out
Policy decisions or policy uh
papers that are relevant to
Issues that New Mexico is
facing.
Um, and I, I, you know,
If we do come up with a list of
things that need to be
illuminated, those are not gonna
be easy things to do and we're
gonna upset.
People, and we're gonna upset
subsets of the constituency.
But we also need to look at
You know it is, is this
committee still
Doing the job that led us to the
point to create that committee.
So
I think those are hard questions
to ask. I think those are hard
decisions that need to be made.
But we also owe it to our
constituents and the members of,
of the legislature.
Do we, do we continue to have
20 some odd interim committees
where people are
Feeling guilty and and being
shamed that oh you didn't, you
didn't go to this committee,
will you, how come you didn't go
to that? Well, you know, there's
There's only so much that can be
done. So I think
In the grand scheme of things,
those are decisions that we need
to make.
And they're gonna be difficult.
It's gonna take up, it's gonna
take a lot of discussion.
But we have to look at how are
we best serving the people of
New Mexico.
Do we keep all of these
committees going and are they
the best way to serve.
The people of New Mexico.
Um
They're just my thoughts. All
right. One comic, you know, uh,
and I talk about it in the memo.
The minority is always going to
be at a disadvantage in terms of
membership because they're fewer
that happened to.
Show up, like you said you were
a 9 committees.
Because
The minority is
If, if you're, because of
proportionality, you need more
minority members showing up at
more committees to keep that
proportionality, and that might
be something you look at.
Yeah, I'll tell you, Alan, uh,
Representative Martinez, I, uh,
found myself for multiple
sessions on 11 committees. One
session, I looked at the mileage
at the end of the year and I put
38,000 miles on the truck. And,
and I, I that's just ridiculous.
So I, I did pair my
My situation down quite a bit,
um, you know, stuff that I could
actually contribute to and, and
not be pulling my hair out. But,
but, you know, all that being
said, um,
This is really good stuff. Um,
I, I, I, I really hope that
We can also look at some various
models from around the country
at some point.
I don't know if we go to NCSL
for that or if we, who we talked
to about that, but there was a
reference in there that you
referenced to Janelle, uh, the,
uh, PhD that you mentioned, I
can't remember his name right
now.
Yeah, so maybe that would be a,
a good source of some info there
too on some successful models
around the country.
Alas, he's
Oh, he's late.
He's no longer
Um
We can certainly look at at um
More recent.
Uh, research done. I was using
just the research we have in our
library, and he was such a giant
in legislative scholarship.
Did I
So
Call to, um,
Quote him.
But yes, we can look at other
models. We'd be happy to.
That's the council service. I
wasn't.
It's, I, it wasn't the royal we.
And I hope y'all read that memo.
You know, Janelle, I'm having
trouble finding your memo.
I know it's in here somewhere,
but I hadn't found it yet.
Oh, the woods, it looks like
you're in the building, correct?
Right. Can I come up to see you?
I will send one down.
OK, thank you. I'm in my office.
Done.
Just a note to that Janelle had
the former studies from 2001 and
2 and 07 bound for you all, and
she'll get them to you, um, and
Senator Woods, since you're in
the building, maybe we can get
that to you today as well. And
other folks, we can mail it.
I've, I've got those two
studies.
Oh.
If you, if you could just drop
mine off at the minority office,
I can pick it up next week.
Sure, be happy to. Thank you.
Uh, you know, in my eyes,
I don't mind
Even spending the money for
these interims.
But each one of them has to
have.
Some fruit.
Achieve. I mean, we, we should
have.
Some study.
Them studies some subject.
That we need a solution to and
then make recommendations from
those interims.
Either through legislation or at
least a report.
2 legislative council. In, in my
eyes, we should know.
How these are functioning and,
and if they are functioning
well,
We need to have a report to
determine.
You know, this was an issue that
we saw, this is a study that we
took and
And possible solutions to, to
solve the issue.
Um
And I know there's some of them
that we can't do anything about
it. I mean, uh, LFC and the
standing.
Constitutional committees, but
the others, the
Economic development
Committee.
You know,
Can they propose
Some
Some economic development that
they saw during their interim if
they traveled all over the
state.
That is really showing the state
is really stepping up and
helping
Create more business in the
state.
LC.
Are they proposing a, a change
to our educational system and
some, some form or some way.
That, uh
Can be carried through through
legislation, and I know there's
a lot of legislation come out of
that committee.
But that's what I'm looking at.
I mean, we just need to justify
that these committees
are doing the work or doing
their job and, and their
Providing fruit to their labor
and
If they are, well.
Then our work's done.
Maybe in addition to the design,
everybody of the um committee of
the interim process.
I think, uh, uh, uh Senator
Woods is right on. I mean, maybe
we, we charge them with
3 to 5 specific things there are
to do in that interim.
So that there's a uniform
approach to what we get on the,
the byproduct we get it or the
product we get at the end.
Of the interim process.
I, I'm aware of a couple of
them, and one of them is if
there's an endorsed package of
legislation.
But as far as I can tell, that's
the only thing.
That, you know, so, you know, a
representative uh Hochman Hill
mentioned, which I thought was
really good, is maybe another,
so maybe that's one, you know,
you, you, you, you produce a, an
endorsed package of legislation
would be a charge to every one
of the
The interim committees.
Um, second might be something
like if you have oversight
authority over various agencies
that you have a minimum of
One hearing of the, the most
senior level cabinet secretary,
Superintendent, whatever the
most senior role is to that
interim committee. That might be
a second charge to each one of
the committees.
Uh, you see where I'm going with
that pet? I mean, I love what
you said because there's needs
to be a, a product out of this.
Yeah, I, I agree. When we set up
the the military and veterans
Committee.
Um, I think, um, it was with
Senator David Ulibari and uh
Representative, um.
Rudy Martinez
When those discussions were
being held, that was one of the
discussions.
What, what is, what is the
purpose and what are the
outcomes that we hope to have.
And we did have oversight of
Um
Veteran services and we did have
Some oversight over military
affairs, even though the
majority of the of the uh
mission is federal.
Um, there was oversight, we
would bring in.
Leadership of both of those uh
organizations,
um, yeah, I like that idea. I, I
really like the idea of
oversight.
Yeah, so, so maybe that's the
second one.
No, I don't know what the third
one is, but maybe the third one
could be something along the
lines of
What is this legislative package
look like in terms of dollars
and cents.
And what are measurable
Outcomes
You know, of, of that
legislative package. Otherwise,
why are you proposing it?
And I think, I think one of the
things that we need to look at,
and I think Jarrett
Really helped us out in, in
providing the attendance is if
some of these committees are not
being well attended.
There has to be a reason for
that either the work that
they're doing is not
Um, I don't want to say
important, but the work that
they're doing is not, uh,
Valued
Yeah, so,
Why, why are some of these
committees not being well
attended? Why are they always
looking for, you know, having to
deputize somebody to be a voting
member on that.
Um, I think that's one of the
things that we need to kind of
Drill down and find out why are
why are these not being
attended.
I need to step away real quick
to take a phone call. Um, I'll
be back in about 2 or 3 minutes.
Well, well, one thing I want to
put on the as a charge for this
committee is, and I love what
Pat said, Let's have some clear
deliverables out of the interim
process.
One is an endorsed package,
like, you know, we said 2 might
be.
Um
Presentation oversight of the
area that they are responsible
for in state government.
And I'll throw 3 out there is,
uh, you know, a, a rundown of
the deliverables, the, the
The uh measurable outcomes of
that legislative package that
that committee worked on all in
on this example.
I, I love the way he phrased it.
What's the purpose of this
committee? I think that
That is key. What is the purpose
and is it being met?
And then maybe we do some
Real scouring of the cages if
you will, and I mean there's
tobacco settlement, there's
Several subcommittees to the
several of the interims, there's
You know, all of that stuff, if
we can just maybe kind of go
from A to Z.
And subcommittees A to Z on each
ones that have subcommittees.
Maybe we spend 11 of these
meetings doing that might not be
a bad idea.
So, so two things might be,
again, what are the deliverables
from the, these interims and
then 2.
Um, let's go through every
committee A to Z and maybe even
invite some of those chairs to
come in here and say, why is
this committee or subcommittee
still needed?
And maybe they have a very good
reason to tell us.
I mean, this isn't a business,
but that's how I run my
business. I mean, you come in
and we, we're thinking about
making some changes this, that
or the other, you know, we, we
invite everybody that has a part
with that, and we talked to them
about why, why are we going in
this direction? Why do we need
this?
Whatever it is that we're doing.
Or maybe we make the decision
that we don't need it.
And, and, and with that,
Senator,
We have, I know the legislative
council service provides expert
testimony.
Uh, we actually bring in experts
from in-state or out of state.
To testify before some of these
committees. So we should have a
track to see if these, some of
these committees are studying
the same issue.
And, and maybe not.
They still have 2 committees,
but at least meet at the same
time.
During that time.
To hear the same information.
Uh, and instead of
This guy, and I don't know where
that happens, whether someone
testifies one week here and next
week over here.
On the same subject, but that
would be a, uh, you know, if, if
they just all met at one time,
even if they were, they could
co-chair the committee or
something.
And we do that periodically. I
know that we've had LFC and LESC
meet jointly.
Um
And a few others. You might
remember that Pat. I think you
were.
Mhm
Um, and then when we go through
sort of the A through A through
Z of each of the committees. We,
we really need to have the
conversation on
Should any of this be collapsed
into one committee like the
example I gave before of
An information technology
oversight of Los Alamos
oversight, uh whatever
oversight, you know, to bring
them all back into some sort of
a an alignment.
And then maybe that's where some
of these committees would be,
these interims would be shaved
off.
Well, in the past, they have put
You know, there's been
recommendation to combine some
of these committees and some of
that paperwork, some of those
task forces did make some
recommendations like that.
And uh
I think you're right. Bring
those committee chairs in.
And, and
Tell us why they still need
their committee to look at their
subject matter.
I think that'd be an excellent
idea.
So, uh, Representative Hochman
the Hill, I, I just want to let
you know we sort of started
talking about
What would we, where would we go
from here? Um, one of them was,
we were going to make a list of
3 to 5 um requirements of every
of every interim committee by
the end of the interim.
Some of the things we talked
about were um
Um
A legislative package would be
delivered from that interim
committee.
To, uh, might be, um,
You know, a rundown A to Z of
each each committee and do we
need to collapse any of them?
Uh, 3, what was the other one,
that we talked about, um,
we, we need to, we need to have
a, uh, you know, if they're
studying a particular issue.
We hope they come to some kind
of consensus on that issue.
So that we can, you know, bring
forth either legislation or a
report.
Uh, describing both sides of
that issue and why it's, it's
hard to come to consistency. We
need to have some proof that
they
Accomplished the task, I guess
is what I would say.
The, the two things on that, um,
and thank you for bringing me up
to speed, Senator. I think I
fried my computer, so now I'm on
my phone, um, but
I think it's really important
that we
Make the interim task oriented
again, and so I agree completely
with what Senator, uh, what
whats is saying and that maybe
perhaps requiring each committee
produce a report that has to be
presented to the legislature as
a whole, after the interim is
complete. I mean, LFC always has
a budget framework by the end of
their work, right? And so they
have that task orientation,
perhaps we need to do the same
thing other than just, you know,
bill endorsement half the time,
it's
doesn't really matter anyways
because people immediately
change their bills once the,
the, the session begins, and so,
um, I like that idea. And also,
I know that Janelle had
mentioned, um, a lot of
duplicative work that's
happening in the interim
committees, and uh, again,
anecdotal experience, I've sat
on two committees that have had
the same exact or slightly
modified presentation from the
same people, um, talking about
the same thing and so one way
that we could maybe uh not not
collapse the work but make it
more effi
would be to have some sort of
way in which committee chairs
could share information as to
what they're doing with whom,
when, so that, um, you know,
maybe we can have joint
committee hearings. I know that
CCJ is uh talking about having a
joint hearing with um LHHS. That
way we collapse the number of
meetings that people have to
attend, and um it, it kind of,
um, you know, brings all of that
effort together, so we don't
waste, we don't spin our wheels.
Necessarily. And so that would
be two things that I would
suggest as well.
you actually further uh
summarize that perfectly
representative because that we
did talk about that when you
were off. That's great, great.
The other one that I remember,
the third one was also just
simply performance measures
that, that, uh, LFC and others
can look at and have studied
based on the package and door of
legislation endorsed by the
interim that interim committee.
And so, you know, these are the
3 to 5 outcomes of this.
package of legislation that the
science technology Committee as
an example endorsed.
Instead of just throwing this
out to the full legislature and
then throwing it out to the
To the governor and then
throwing it out to the people of
New Mexico. Well, what are we
gonna get out of this?
But what, what are we really
gonna get from this happening or
not happening.
Um, might be a third.
Interim requirement for each
committee.
You good.
And then we also talked about,
uh, I think you were still on
for that one, but for this, but,
you know, can we start maybe
look at some source in CSL or
otherwise, maybe we have a grid
of, I, I'm sure there's no real
way to
grid this kind of thing, or
maybe there is, I don't know,
but uh the state's interim
processes and let's not reinvent
the wheel, everybody, that if we
don't have to, or let's make 11
wheel that we see.
It looks a lot better, make it
even better for New Mexico, but
I, I don't know that we want to,
I don't know that we even have
enough time to completely
reinvent the wheel, reinvent all
interim.
But maybe there's a works for
us.
Have we talked at all about um
possibly limiting the number of
committees that members can
serve on as a voting member.
I don't think we have.
Just an idea. I know it'll be
controversial, but it might be,
it might be a way to kind of
again encourage um
Participation.
Yeah,
boy.
I agree if we once we start to
drill down into the
The process, I, I think that's
one of the things that we really
need to take a hard look at.
Um
And when we make those
adjustments, uh,
representatives, uh, I, I think
that you wind up having a more,
more manageable quorum process
or number.
Maybe that's the sheer number of
voting per.
Might not be a bad thing because
then you have more
Well, I don't know. I mean, I
That, that, that is probably
gonna be one of the big
questions we need to answer.
Good point.
So when are we meeting again?
We've been at it almost an hour
and a half here.
Um,
Senator, August 22nd is the next
meeting of this committee.
And just as a heads up, I'd, I'd
like to try to get NCSL to
Make some kind of presentation
at, at that meeting. Now that
we've kind of looked a little
bit about how we got here.
In New Mexico's case, maybe look
at at some other states
approaches, although I will, I
will caution you that
It's not reinventing the wheel,
we just have different wheels in
different states, like it's, it,
it doesn't translate, but that's
it's still, it's, there's still
value in that.
You know, we, we, I'd like to
look at what's working.
In other states. That's hard to
quantify, but we can ask. That's
true.
What is working?
It's like trying to define what
is normal.
And that Representative
Martinez, please let me know.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna jump in
that swimming pool.
I stopped giving up on normal a
long time ago.
I was never normal, so I, I
never tried.
OK, we're good.
We're ready to go.
I think so, but take some time
and, and look at Janelle's memo,
if you would look at the 02 and
07. If you need hard copies, um,
we have those and we're happy to
provide them.
There's one thing, Jared, if
there is a, if you come upon or
happen upon
Uh, summarized whatever from
NCSL or something, well before
the, the 22nd of August, please
get that to us because I'm sure
we're all kind of anxious to see
that. I know I am. And also, of
course, and I realized that that
yesterday was a
Kind of late to dump an awful
lot of data on you also.
You know, spend a little bit of
time between now and and August
kind of pouring over that as
your schedules permit, and I
know you're all busy.
Um
This subcommittee is really
going to test your mettle as
whips, I suspect,
um.
In addition to your other many
duties?
Just real quick, Jared, do we
have a work plan on
The do as presented alleged
counsel, I'll send it to you,
but basically the subcommittees.
Going to look at data.
Um, and make recommendations on
how to improve the interim
process. It's fairly big.
Um, I'm talking more about
future meetings.
Not as such, no, but if, if you
want to start to flesh that out
a little bit in these last few
moments that
be great.
Well, I think we have a plan. 11
is, is we're gonna
Look at the NCSL stuff as soon
as it's available. We're gonna
study which you already provided
to us.
And then we're gonna maybe look
at A to Z, the entire interim
committee.
Design or or or or list or
whatever, and then, and then
we're gonna put together some
Some, uh, um,
Performance measures for all
interim committees. I'm just
throwing those 4 or 5 topics out
there as things that we've all
sort of thrown out there.
And Representative Martinez, if
you're also looking for dates
that are kind of set, you know,
on the calendar. Those are on
the interim calendar on the
website.
OK, thank you.
Mhm
And thanks, uh, everybody.
Thanks, Jared and Janelle and
Monica and.
Yeah, of course. Thanks
everyone. Yeah, if somebody
needs anything in the meantime
feel free to reach out, always.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
