So anyway, we'll start
off uh introduce,
we'll start off with the
Senator Ballas,
introducing himself.
Good morning, Mr Chairman,
vice chair
uh state Senator
Roberto Bobi J Gonzalez
District six encompasses
part of Los Alamos
via Santa Fe and
House.
>> Good morning, Mr Chairman,
madam, vice chair
members of the committee.
I see a big audience here
today. My
name is Harry Garcia
House District 69
which covers parts of San Juan
mckinney's bourn and the
world.
I've been in this committee since
2016.
Good committee. We
need to keep in mind that
the transportation is the
backbone of our
economy in our state. So
we need to try harder to
uh fund, get better funding
for these uh
organizations. We can move
ahead. Thank you, Mr
Chairman.
>> Good morning, Mr chair, madam
chair, Anthony
Allison are at the
San Juan district. You
don't get no further
northwest than I
do in New Mexico.
Thank
you.
>> I thank you. I'm Representative
Kathleen Cas from District
44. It's all of Corrales,
parts of Rio Rancho,
northern end of
Albuquerque and what they
refer to as the unincorporated
area of
Alameda
>> morning, Mr chair and Vice
Chair. Um, I'm State
Rep Joy Garrett. I'm
in Northwest Bernal Leo
in Albuquerque, Omma
ATRIO
vista boulevard, VSE
del Norte
Cattle. Even though
it's in Benli County.
Uh, great to be here today.
Thanks.
>> Yeah,
thank you, Mr Chair. Good morning,
everybody. I'm Jennifer
Jones. I represent district
32. It's the southernmost
district and includes the boot
heel. It's good to be here this
morning,
>> Mr Chair and madam vice chair.
I'm Senator
David Galle's district
41 and on the very
southeast side of the state,
we bring you oil and gas
and
revenue.
>> Good morning, Mr, chairman,
members of the committee,
excuse me, fall allergies.
I am representative
uh day Hochman V Hill.
I represent District House
District 15 which is in the North Valley
of Albuquerque. I'm also very
proud to be the vice chair
of this very
important committee. I echo the
sentiment and my colleague,
uh Representative
Garcia Transportation
is the backbone of, of,
of what we do here in the
legislature and I want to make everybody
feel better. There are like
four different
interim committees going on today
including legislative council.
So it's not us.
It's just everybody
else and people will be floating
in and out as they can. Thank
you.
>> Good morning. I'm Sheila Kelleher
and I'm a researcher with the Legislative
Council
service.
Yes, I came in just in time.
Thank you so much. Good morning to
everyone. My name is Nancy.
I'm Senator Nancy Rodriguez
from Santa fe happy
to be here as your guest today,
Mr Chairman. Thank
you for all your great work. This
committee works hard.
So I'm happy to be here to
check out your issues and
see what we can do.
Thank
you.
>> Yeah,
pick up the first item which
is planning for future
risk and building
resilience
and we have
two
officers from the
pur trust
and um
take it away.
>> Well, thank you, Mr Chair madam,
vice chair members of the committee.
Also thank you to Sheila for helping
get us here and uh helping
arrange this. Uh
It's our pleasure to share some
of our research and work with you,
particularly looking at
uh preparing for future risk
and resilience
against uh environmental
and extreme weather and climate
for transportation system.
I'm joined by my, my name is David Drain. I'm
joined by my colleague, Fatima
Yusuf and
as a quick introduction, the Pew
Charitable Trust is a nonpartisan
nonprofit that works on a wide range
of public policy issues,
you know, with a particular focus on
those of importance and
interest to state governments.
Uh While we cover a range of
topics, all of our work
has, you know, similar,
similar approach, data
driven, transparent and
inclusive,
and then specifically our work
on long-term liabilities
uh which team and I are both on the
team exploring.
And this goes back to 2007
when we started by looking
at the bill coming due for
unfunded liabilities for
pension retiree health care benefits
in states. Uh Our
work obviously had a very
strong fiscal lens, but we expanded
to include things that plan design,
retirement, security governance
investments, uh and
tools to measure and manage
risk. And now we've
expanded this to look at another bill
coming due. Uh Yeah,
and looking at broader set of long term
liabilities that impact state
fiscal sustainability,
particularly the bill coming due for
deferred maintenance for
infrastructure uh
roads, bridges and surface
transportation, as well
as the long term cost of building resilience
against climate and extreme
weather.
So we'll talk about
broken this into four pieces,
talking about climate
risk to state transportation,
transportation system
assets, you know, across
to the states, talking
about New Mexico's uh
transportation
resilience improvement plan as a
specific example of looking at
conditions and challenges in
New Mexico, talking
about a framework for planning
for climate costs and building
resilience unless
talking about managing declining fuel
taxes from electric vehicle
transition, expanding on some of the
material we shared with this committee
previously. And
you know, obviously this is an important policy
conversation. It's also in real life and
you just want to acknowledge the the
flooding and challenges
in communities in, in New
Mexico and
you know how this has direct
impact on
so that I'll turn it over to
Fatima. >> Thanks David.
Um Good morning
chair, madam, vice chair and
distinguished members of the committee.
Thank you again for having us here, I'm
Fatima Sophie.
Um And we'll
start off on slide six
talking about our
aging infrastructure systems.
So across the US,
uh our aging infrastructure
is increasingly
vulnerable to climate related
risks.
And in 2021
the American Society of Civil Engineers
reported that 43% of the
nation's growth were in poor
condition contributing
to a $435
billion backlog and needed
repairs and
maintenance.
And of course, on top of these costs,
uh estimates for future climate
related damage to these under maintained
roads um could cost up
to $20 billion annually.
By the end of the century.
For New Mexico, it's important
to consider uh the
compounding effects of these deferred
maintenance problems and climate
impacts to the state's transportation
network, especially as
disruptions and damage from extreme
weather are only increasing and
intensifying.
Additionally, state officials should
also keep in mind that these
communities with a
history of under investments are more
vulnerable to these impacts and face
greater challenges addressing these
riding costs.
And as you'll see on slide
seven, from
this chart from the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration
illustrates that extreme weather
events are becoming more frequent
and with them, the costs are
rising. The share
of billion dollar weather events
in the US experiencing
including floods, wildfires,
storms has surged in
recent decades.
Um These increases
in costs are driven by a
combination of factors
including more of our infrastructure
assets being um
in harm's way and in vulnerable
areas. Um
the condition
and aging and under maintained
systems, we have to date and
then of course, the growing
intens growing
intensity of extreme weather
events and climate shifts throughout
the country.
And then as you'll see on
slide
eight,
this is especially concerning for New
Mexico where droughts
wildfires and severe
storms directly impact
the rotation
infrastructure across your state.
As my colleague, David would discuss
later. In fact,
the NOA A um
notes that New Mexico has faced
$37 billion
weather events over the last couple of
decades including 17
droughts, 12 wildfires,
seven severe storms,
a cyclone
all causing between 5 to
$10 billion worth of damage in
total.
Um And so you'll see
on slide nine
across the financial sector,
the economic consequences
of climate impacts
are grouped in two chunks
um fiscal risks
or loss when
losses when people assets
or income are affected by
severe weather events or natural
disasters and then
transition risks which are the costs
from efforts to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions that contribute to these
climate changes such
as climate policies and new
technologies. So what
does this mean for state
transportation budgets?
States can expect higher costs
for emergency repairs and disruptions
due to severe weather. It
can also expect
increasing expenses from more
frequent maintenance and repairs
and sometimes complete redesigns
of transportation systems to handle
new climate stressors.
And of course, um there are
potential revenue losses from
climate policies and technologies
like reduced gas tax income
from the proliferation of electric
vehicles. Now,
I'll pass it back to David to talk
about. Um take a closer
look at the physical risks to New
Mexico's transportation system.
>> Thank you, Fatima. And if
you look at slide 11 or page
11, you know, this is
taken from
the new Mexico dot S
resilience improvement
plan. Uh You know, this is
a, a document that a number of
state dot s in a number of
states uh
have
uh have put in place to
assess vulnerability
and risks across the state
transportation infrastructure.
Uh So in this case, we see
a map of New Mexico, we see the
covered of, you know, roads and
bridges, we see color
coding of places that the
dot process is identified
as risk
hotspots.
We look at slide
12.
So how does the dot
assess this? Well, it's a number of
steps, sorry if I'm totally
in the way. Um
So step one is
to identify exposures, what
are the things that roads and
bridges in New Mexico are exposed
to? Uh And then also
asking the question
sensitivity, you know,
what's, what's the
damage or risk
to those uh you know,
transportation assets based on,
based on geography based on
local climate conditions, based
on the design of the roads and
bridges and based on the condition,
you know, because as as roads
and bridges deteriorate their vulnerability
goes up or
the, you know, sensitivity goes
up, then they take
the vulnerability assessment and they add
to it criticality
if this rotor bridge is impeded,
if it's damaged, if it's not able
to function, does it affect the
state as a whole? Is it at
risk to, you know, to
people's access to hospitals,
to evacuation routes,
travel across the stra
state to tourism dollars
or to freight travel.
So bring those pieces
together, they identify resilience
risk and then identify
hotspots
on slide 13, we talk, you
know, talk more
about some of the specific
risks that were identified,
uh you know, and pairing this with
some of the research and findings
from the National Fifth Climate
assessment. And
so, you know, rising
temperature as one of the concerns
from, you know, our changing
climate and lead to extreme
heat that also has
direct impact on the
surfaces of roads.
And the
joints of bridges also
means you may not be able to have construction
crews out as working as
intensely in
that heat changes in
frequency and intensity of rainfall can
both lead to droughts and
you know, surface cracking and
sinkholes as well as flash
flooding. Um And
you know, with higher rain we
saw and then
with increased winds, you see the
vulnerability and risk of wildfires
and dust storms, additional
risks identified within
a resilience improvement
plan.
So then
which roads are at risk and how
many? And so what, what
this assessment found is about 20%
of the road and bridge miles in New
Mexico, you see broken
out by district as well statewide
or at high or very high
risk. You know, obviously
that means 80% are at a lower
medium risk. So, you know, the
the risks are not evenly
distributed across the state.
And one of the things that this type
of approach allows is prioritization,
identifying where
projects and where action is
needed.
And of course, one of this gets to
what do you do next from this
information and how do
you make sure that this information
is being applied and being used within
the state? Obviously, the
federal government has a big
role in setting policy and in funding
large aspects of transportation.
And after all things like
this, uh resilience
impact um
improvement studies are part
of uh you know, federal requirements
and federal grant programs.
But as this report shows
resilience project needs in New Mexico
are greater than what protect funding
can provide alone.
And so this brings up three
important questions.
How can the state connect the need
for resilient roads and bridges
with the capital, budgeting and
fiscal decisions being made
in the statehouse?
How can the New Mexico
dot stakeholders
and researchers build upon this
methodology and
analysis
uh in order to better understand things, you
know, we
don't know everything that's going on in the world
today and we certainly don't know what the future will
hold. And
planning and effective long
term fiscal decision making relies
on having the best information
we can in the situation of
uncertainty. And I think
we, you know, we've already seen within New
Mexico's approach, improvements
between the 2021 R IP
and the 2024 as
they apply more sophisticated
data and more sophisticated
approaches. And
then given the funding needs, what's
an affordable and sustainable approach for
New Mexico to paying for resilience
needs? How do you fill the
gap? And you know, at the
end, I'll talk about example
in Pennsylvania of the state,
looking at their challenges
and trying to uh
to follow a similar
approach of asking and answering those
questions.
So with that, I'll turn it back over to
Fatima.
>> Thank you.
So the good news is that New
Mexico is ahead of the game.
Um It's already coordinating
resilience efforts across the
state. Um As David
went over the state dot has
worked on identifying climate
risks and vulnerabilities as
part of a broader and it also
working as part of a broader coalition
of state agencies to
finalize the statewide adaptation
plan. And
while no single approach can cover
all climate risks and financial
challenges, um a structured
framework can help
policymakers and officials assess
vulnerabilities, prioritize
investments and develop long term
strategies to help decision maker
prepare for costs and
strengthen transportation
networks and
framework is on slide
18,
what can policymakers do
to support the efforts that have already
happened at the state agency
level? Um
They can do so by
integrating report findings
into their budgeting practices,
long term financial plans and
spending decisions that you all
make. Um
you can also develop strategies
to fund these climate costs
using a variety of
uh federal resiliency
grants, eight capital
improvement funds or resiliency
funds and low-cost
loans and debt financing to meet
its financial needs.
Additionally, um
policymakers could think
about setting up mechanisms to
provide financial or other
resources to localities
uh to ensure that funding
opportunities are distributed in an
equitable way across the
state.
Um
And so, as you'll see
in the chart on slide
19, while
finding the money can be challenging.
Um This, this chart
from the Colorado Eot
Transportation Asset Management
plan shows that
highlights the importance of life
cycle asset management and how
making these investments now can
save you money over the long
term while providing New
Mexico residents with safer and
better
roads.
And then on slide
20
might look familiar from our
last presentation.
Um but
California's approach is a strong
example of a state that's connecting
the dots between coordinated statewide
resiliency planning,
prioritizing high-risk projects
and developing funding streams to pay
for them. And while
this uh climate
program that California's
dot created to fund these
projects uh relies heavily
on federal funding from the Protect
Act as we'll discuss
in the next slide.
Um This is just one of
several resources that California
and other states are exploring to pay for
these costs.
And you'll see on slide
21
that Cal California
is also proposing a $10 billion
climate bond um which will be
on the ballot in November for the
state, New York
recently passed a $4.2
billion bond in 2022 to
pay for resiliency
projects.
Um South Carolina
has recently created a statewide
resiliency revolving fund to
provide low-cost loans
to and grants to local
governments for these projects.
And several states like Missouri,
Vermont and Rhode Island are
utilizing mechanisms like
state infrastructure, banks and bond
banks who offer local
interest loans to the municipalities
to deal with their priority
needs.
California and Massachusetts
and Maryland are also
exploring programs
like food pay
programs uh charging
companies for past carbon
emissions to fund resiliency
efforts with mixed
results. And then
states like Massachusetts are
exploring um
all sorts of fees and
excise tax increases
as well as um dedicating
portions of rainy
day funds or pluss towards
adaptation and resiliency.
And now I'll pass it back to David
who will go over uh another
state that's thinking about these
challenges.
Um
>> Thank you, Pama. And so if you look
at page 23
you know, looking at
the challenge of managing the
fiscal impacts of the electric vehicle
transition and the
stagnancy or decline in fuel
taxes in many states is
going to be one of the challenges every
state is going to need to face.
And we wanted to offer
more detail on an example
that we shared at um our
September presentation
of how Pennsylvania has chosen
to explore and ask,
ask and answer this
question the first
to set up the problem, right,
federal and state fuel taxes pay for
about a third of state highway funding.
Very state by state on
how dependent they are on that
specific revenue stream.
And as we see growing use of electric
cars of hybrids of just
general improvements in the efficiency
of it, internal combustion
engines that tax
is not going to be as,
you know, as as present
in in future years.
And states
will, you know, will benefit from
thinking ahead to that problem and,
and coming up with an answer now
before there's a crisis
rather than when the dollars are,
are falling short.
So what can a state do? And
you know, we identified 44
key steps, right? First, assess
your current uh road
and bridge conditions and
then identify current and
future funding needs
based on those conditions. What I need
to pay for deferred maintenance, that's already
happened. What I need to pay for
rehabilitation repair
today. What will my needs
be in, you know, the coming years
and decades. And based
on that, and based on how much funding
is currently available, what's the size of
the funding gap? How far are you falling
short? And then lastly,
once you know how big a hole you need to fill,
what are some of the options available in
your state? And so
Pennsylvania's transportation revenue
option commission was one
approach that a state took
to try to explore and answer these
questions. Um This is
not obviously the only model we've seen
Kansas Maine, Missouri,
Nevada, North
Carolina and Utah all done,
you know, processes to try to
ask and answer this question.
It's also just because you have
proposal doesn't mean you have a
policy and you know, Pennsylvania
is still considering what they
want to do and how they want to approach
things, but at least it creates a
starting point for that
conversation.
So if you look at slide
or page 24
you know, why is Pennsylvania so worried
about this? Well, they are particularly dependent
on fuel taxes for their
transportation funding. Uh
you know, much higher
share of their state transportation revenue
comes from that source compared to
neighboring and pure states.
So, you know, this is
still an issue for every single
state. You know, even if it's
a small chunk of your revenue that goes
away, that's going to be a whole,
but it's a particular concern for
Pennsylvania.
So then on page 25
how did they understand
the size of their gap and their
challenges. And they
looked at the conditions of the roads,
they looked at uh needs and
unmet needs and found that state
transportation needs are about twice the size
of the pen dot budget. And then
you add in uh nearly
4 billion in local shortfalls.
And that created the size of the problem
that they were facing.
Where do these shortfalls come from?
Well, variety of sources
increased emergency repair
spending, particularly from flash
floods, decline of the gas
tax, more stringent federal condi
uh condition requirements on
national highway system, roads
rising inflation, construction
costs, the dollar does not go as
far in terms of
highway building and maintenance.
And the additional cost of addressing
past deferred maintenance and
the need for more expensive interventions
once a road or bridges fallen
in condition
and then it's not like that
problem just goes away the next year and
extends over time and they were
facing ongoing shortfalls.
Uh you know, finding more than 100
billion gap between
needs and investments
under under current policy
over the next decade for the state
system alone, looking at roads,
bridges, system,
modernization needs and
multimodal
transportation.
So then the question is, how do you fill
that gap and the proposal that
they landed on? And obviously this
is, you know, one
option for Pennsylvania
to consider as they actually
implement these policies.
It's also, you know, one option
that uh for other states
to look at. But
their goal was in a world
where the gas tax was declining to
stop relying on it, as you can
see in years five, plus
they phased out the gas tax.
The fundamental thing that they're replacing,
it is a proposed road
user charge a vehicle miles, travel
tax, uh, that
they would pilot in years
one through four and then fully
implement and roll out in year
five. But they also wanted
to diversify, you know, revenue
streams. So they looked at increased
tolling, increased, uh
you know, uh fees
on vehicle registration,
looking at taking
back some previously
diverted funds from transportation
sources and putting it back into the dot
budget. And with
those pieces, it looks,
you know, they, they saw that they could
fill the gap that they were
facing.
Um, you know, these are just one of
the sets of potential
approaches for states to consider and we look
at how, you know what other states
are doing. We see a variety
of options being considered
piloted in some cases
implemented. So road
user charges once again charging
people for vehicle miles traveled
also with an adjustment for
weight of the
vehicle, you know, is
being considered. We've
seen pilots in, for example,
Oregon, where there's a voluntary
road user charge.
You know, if you opt into
the program, you get exempted from
other bill fees and
registration fees.
Uh 32 states have some
form of specific
electric vehicle registration fee
to try to make up for the fact
that those vehicles won't be
paying, uh, fuel
taxes. Uh, you
can increase the existing fuel taxes.
What Illinois did though, obviously
there's ways that that's not a long
term solution, you know,
but at least get
some additional revenue in the short
term. And
then basically creating
an electricity fuel tax
is. What a number of states including
Montana have done. Basically
a tax on charging stations
that, you know, serves to
try to have,
you know, a fuel tax for
gasoline and diesel powered
vehicles and fuel tax that
will apply to electric
vehicles. And
then lastly, a number of several
states have expanded tolling and
you know, relied on that
as a way of trying to get
additional transportation revenue.
Um you know, I said there's
a number of options the states are
considering. Uh
I don't think any state has really
solved their problem. You know, even
Pennsylvania's proposal
is just a proposal at this
stage, but
there's, you know, advantages to
thinking ahead rather than having
to be reactive when funds are
falling short.
So that just to, you know, wrap up her
key findings and then we're excited to have
questions and discussion,
you know, climate risk, the transportation
networks are becoming more frequent
and more costly. Um
You can see in that increased number
of billion dollars in extreme
weather events and
as well as other challenges as
fatima laid out
a timely investments in maintenance
and resilience can save states money in the
long term, while also protecting
the important assets that people rely
on and also maintaining access
to residents. Right? Obviously, part
of this is a fiscal conversation
and the state make sure
that costs are being spread across,
you know, years and budgets.
But it's also, you know, having
roads that are safe and available for your
residents is an important public policy
goal. Uh New
Mexico's dot Resilience
improvement plan includes a comprehensive
vulnerability assessment of
statewide transportation networks.
And it is an example
of a state
that's taking steps to
understand and be ready
to think about and address these
problems. And then the
question is, how do you integrate those
findings into capital planning and
budgeting? And how do
you secure funding for these resilience
initiatives? Uh
And New Mexico, you know, we
also need to think ahead about
the impact of ev transition
on fuel taxes even though
fuel taxes are, you know, a
smaller share of New
Mexico's revenue, transportation
revenues and other states.
Um You know, and
obviously there's variation
and, you know, prevalence
of electric vehicles,
you know, if there is a gap
emerges that will create long
term challenges and
should be part of the
discussion and
that we once again, just really appreciate
this opportunity to share, share
some of our ongoing work and
research and
you know, would love to hear any questions
or anything else we
can that
on
>> presentation. And
um we have
uh
Senator,
>> thank you. Um Good
morning.
Um, I
guess the question that I would
ask is, um,
um,
so what we're
facing in our
state
is that if you went down
with each or
legislators, everyone
understands the
safety, the need for
roads, the,
you know,
bridges
to, on.
But what we don't
have is
a political will
erase fuel
tax,
you know, and we
have worked on other
areas and, uh,
do you see that within other
states?
>> I, I think we see that same challenge
in other states of,
you know, it's going to go back to
Pennsylvania. They,
you know, governor, gubernatorial
executive order, you know, created
this committee staff
with stakeholders experts
dot and other government officials,
legislators
have an answer for the state.
But you know, there's a big
challenge, big gap between we have
this number that we need to hit
and getting everyone
in a position where they can vote for it.
You know, knowing that there will be challenges
and, and pushback.
So, you know, I think the challenge
of political will
is,
is a real and broad
one. I
think our, our
hope with some of our work
is if you at least
can show what this money is going
towards. You know, you
are the, you know, things that
will protect these roads and bridges
in the various districts across New
Mexico and other states.
You are the things that we can do
and here's how we will save money over the long
run maybe that makes things
easier. But, you know,
I, I think we, we recognize and
acknowledge that that's a challenge.
>> And uh Mr Chairman
also, what makes
our, ours even
harder is
we have many mile
New Mexico is the fifth
largest state
and that is a lot of
miles, you know,
with a very
limited
resources.
And the part
of, um
I, I guess the first
part that we would have to start
is with a, a very good
campaign,
you know, with education, with
understanding why the
need. But we
have tried a one cent
tax a five cent
10 cent. And
while our neighboring
states, you know, have been
successful, we
have not.
And we have been
behind the
other problem that we have
is, um,
back in
1995
we had a six cent
gas repeal
and we have never made
that up. We really
shot ourselves on the foot, you know,
taking that. So
between that and to
where we are today,
2024
we have lost a lot of revenue
just on that part.
But, um, oh, this
is what I see, this is our
challenge. It's just
getting back to just,
we, we all
want good roads. We
all want safety, all
want not to wait in
line, but
at the same time,
are we willing to take
a part of a,
or, or share for
it? And
that's all I have. Mister chairman. Thank
you and thank you for your
report.
>> Uh Next
up, we
have a
representative Garrett followed by
representative,
>> thank you, Mr Chair. Thank
you. I was not
aware that we had a resilience
improvement plan.
Did we ever looked
at
that?
Do we look at
>> it?
Just kidding? No. Were you
aware? >> I was aware but
um
one of the ideas that's been floated is
that we have dot come and
give us a presentation
on that plan because it actually
fits in a lot
with the discussions we're gonna be having
at the end of the
interim about a
package of
potential funding
bills that will hopefully
come with the endorsement of this
committee.
>> So thank you for bringing that
up.
And then we have a new Mexico
climate adaptation and
resilience plan too.
So without this presentation,
most of us wouldn't have
known, but at least one
of us did. So that's good.
So thank you for that. Now,
we just had a major
disaster emergency
in Roswell, which
obviously
happened before you put this
together. How, how
would you classify
that when,
when there's something totally
unexpected? Where does that
fit in
your
chart of what we need
to
consider
>> or deal?
>> Yeah, and very
um chair
and many members
very
um
saddened by the devastation there
and what folks are experiencing.
But um our
understanding is that uh these
sorts of washouts and flash
floods happen often
in areas that have been hit
by wildfires in
previous years. And So, as New
Mexico has been experiencing more and
more wildfires, it's something
to be mindful of, to build in flood
protections in those areas.
And as you mentioned, and in
the climate resiliency plan that the state
dot has, um,
conducted that is the
central, uh,
hotpots, a lot of
them have
a experience
damage from, um, wildfires in the
past and, or are susceptible
to flooding and
um, flash flooding
because there's not that
uh sort of
uh shrubbery and
uh green
infrastructure to like
block the water from
basically washing away the roads.
So it's something to be mindful
of and it's definitely something that
New Mexico has experienced in the
past and potential could
experience going forward.
>> And, you know, Mr Chairman
um representative, it's also, I
think kind of within the framework, it's,
it's the acute physical risk, right.
It's a, you know, sudden damage
and the need of repair as opposed
to the long term chronic
costs of,
you know, higher heat
on, on the road surfacing.
And then, you know, that becomes in a question
of how
do you make sure that the budget has
the flexibility to know, you know, you
know, that things are gonna happen, you don't know where
or how it's gonna happen.
How do you build capital reserves
or other sources of,
you know,
budgetary space to then
address the things that happen.
Um And then to your earlier
point, I think one of the things that we
hope to do with some of our work
is find ways to
connect a lot of the technical
expertise that's happening in dot
is happening in other parts of state
government and with the legislative
process, because it sometimes does
feel a little separated
where, you know, there's this
good information that isn't
getting across and to the extent
that we can help bridge that. I
think that is something we see as
valuable
>> and I'll just add that we know that
several states across the
country, uh like Montana
Massachusetts are
creating or expanding
statewide disaster accounts
to help sort
of uh respond to these
challenges when they don't quite meet
the level of a national disaster,
National Declaration of
Disaster. But it is
quite a disaster and
challenge for the state.
They're trying to create these
funds or expand these
funds.
>> Thank you, Christmas. Yeah,
we, we many of
us to really
do so where so
many bridges were
washed out. But now we have
Roswell which is a forest
fire. It's
5.78
inches of rain in six
hours that
have destroyed things that
people never expect
anyway. Thank you for your
very thoughtful
presentation.
>> Thank you chair. Um
And thank you for your presentation.
I have a just a couple of quick
questions on slide.
14, assessing climate
risks, New Mexico.
This just three
is our
highest population,
is it not?
And yet we
have
the lowest amount of
roads and bridges on
this.
I mean, >> this, this N >> MD
dot Districts. So
district three is the metro
area, Sandoval
and
Bernalillo.
Am I not correct in that?
I mean, >> so Mr Chair, I,
you know this, this was pulled straight
from, from, from the actual
resistence improvement plan. So if there's
kind of important local context
that we missing, uh you
know, I I'm not sure
to the extent that
you know the road, this is just covering
the state roads. So
if you know the
if district
three ends up
having a much higher proportion of the
roads being, you
know, um, non
state. I, I think it wouldn't
show up here, but,
yeah, I guess I, I'm
not familiar enough with
the, with the details of,
of New Mexico's
transportation districts to know
exactly what's going on. This
is what we, what we pulled from
their report.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and
thank you. So, I,
I would be interested
in having someone who
does know because it
is my understanding the district
three has the largest
population,
um the most amount of
traffic, maybe
not the heaviest
vehicles obvious
that that's in a different
district on, on the road.
And yet we
have some of the lowest
numbers which implies to
me that we
do know how to make a plan
and execute it.
We're just maybe not
um
doing it across
the board in all our
districts.
Um So that is a
question that II I
would like,
I, if I'm interpreting
this chart in a different way,
I would love to have further
information about what it
is that you're trying to convey in this
chart um
so that we can do
that um on slide
28 the potential
response for fuel tax
sorted false. We've
seen these before
and um I appreciate
the senator's comments
earlier about
uh the fuel
uh tax, but we've talked
about e annual
registration fees
and road user
charges by
mileage and electricity
sales tax.
Do you have proposals
for the 2025 session
of budget requests
or a bill
that is you are
aware of that will be
um carried
to address these issues
or we just still in
the talking phase
about um
talking about the shortfall,
we know is going to
come
>> Mr Chair representative,
you know, I mean, I
think we're coming
in here to share the research that we
are in the process of doing. And
you know, you know what we're
seeing across States, if
there's kind of a
detailed discussion within New
Mexico about
active steps,
you know, to address these, you know,
I, I think we haven't been part of it
and you know, wouldn't, wouldn't
have anything that we can
share.
>> All right, thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you very much, Mr
Chairman and thank you
both for this really informative
presentation. And
um I, I don't
have questions so much as
I'm just gonna take the opportunity
to, to
um
to reiterate
um something
that I think this committee has been
talking about for a
while now, not just during
this interim process, but the
one before it, thank
you for the report that highlights the
fact that we have
a problem in our hands. And
as it, it relates
to funding
for our transportation and
our road system in New Mexico,
as we see the use
of internal combustion
engines. W
and um
we
need a mechanism
to make up for the
these funding sources
that are gonna steadily continue
to decline So,
um, uh, due to
the thoughtful work of this committee
and many people on this committee,
um, you know, like Senator
Gonzalez and
Representative
Garcia,
we, we've been
having these conversations,
we introduced a bill,
uh, and Senator Talman
and, uh, chair Talman introduced
a bill to introduce
the concept of electric vehicle
registration fees.
Um, but I, I think
it's important to underscore
that it's not a one size
all solution. If we are
going to make up these revenues, we
need an entire package
of things that we can do
to, to make up.
And you know, it doesn't help.
Also the fact that, you know, we
have these record revenue
um excesses
now, but that too is
waning. And so
we need a plan
and um that plan
needs to encompass
all the above approach,
which means utilizing a
larger percentage of the
vehicle excise tax
to go straight to the road fund. It
means ev registration
fees. It means, you know,
potentially putting together
a transportation
trust fund.
Um It also,
you know, we're talking about a new concept
here today which I appreciate, which is
possibly putting money
aside for
disaster response
and you know, uh climate
change issues.
So, um
we need to do it all
and it's gonna be up to the
members of this committee
to put together bill
proposals. Um A
as we get ready for the
60 day session to
ensure that we take care of this issue.
Now, because we cannot
keep kicking the can down the
road. Thank you very
much.
You
>> except we have uh
Senator Rodriguez.
Thank you, Mr Chairman. Good
morning to
presenters and thank
you for your work. Um
I, I guess thinking
about this whole thing with transportation,
we just got out of the LFC
meeting. Uh this week,
most of the week we heard
a lot about transportation
and um you know,
that I think most of the
time we don't realize
how
important it is to
have good roads, adequate
roads, and sufficient
roads to get to where we're
going until we don't have
them. And we realize
something is really wrong.
And, and so,
you know, it's, it's something we take
for granted, I think quite a bit.
But let me just um,
say that we
did, in fact, this last
session appropriate
approximately
$510
million which was a
pretty large chunk
amount. Um,
unlike other years,
um we appropriate
for the Department of
Transportation
320 million
in ST Bs, which
is the severance tax
bonds uh to use.
And then we also, in
addition to that, put in 70
million from the specials
category for them
to continue to
um either maintain
repair, do other
things, complete projects
that they hadn't completed or
whatever it could be. Then
we put in 100 and 20
million in addition
to that specifically
for maintenance and repairs.
And so that totaled
approximately 510
million. But even that,
with that amount that we,
uh, we appropriated,
we, um,
we know that that's not nearly
sufficient. I agree with
the Representative
Andale and
others who, um,
speak incessantly
about the need to have a
continued source of funding
for this. Otherwise,
you know, you really, in our Rhodes
and the staff, the
ot are at the whim
of the legislature,
theros can't be left a
chance. It's too
dangerous. We
uh to traveling in roads
that not adequate
and we need to
do that. But let me just uh
bring up Mr Chairman
and I'll stop as I know
others may want to speak. But
um bring up the fact
that we look back at the
pandemic and
COVID and while
it seems a thing of the past,
we are still feeling the
remnants of that
problem. Um,
you know, the schedule, the
maintenance, the,
um the um
start, start up of
new roads and projects
was delayed quite a bit. It, it
came to a dead stop. It
had to during that
time. And because
of that, we now
see the schedule
derailed dot
had a good schedule to continue
to work on roads throughout the
state, but that schedule
was derailed. So now we're not
only playing catch up with
that, but other needs
have piled up on top of
that. So as a
result of that,
all trying to say
is that the materials
have gone up, the cost
of materials have gone up.
And so the delivery
of those materials, if we
think they're coming in on time,
like they used to way before
COVID, they're not,
things are slower
and manufacturing is slower.
So we're trying to catch up with
all of that. And
um, you know, as
a result of that, we have a bigger
problem in our hands. So I do
think that it's important
to have a plan that has been
recommended here and
to, to see what we
can do to ameliorate the
changes that are happening because
of change. I'm
gonna start with this, I promise Mr
Chairman, but truly,
when I was looking at environmental
risks of transportation
systems, and I saw how
rising temperatures, extreme
heat making a, a difference
on the asphalt and all the
oil that they put
there on the, on the
blacktops and then
the changes of
precipitation. But
one thing that caught my eye because
I experienced it myself
is the increased
winds and dust
storms. You know what?
Just about a year ago,
I was traveling from Albuquerque
to Santa Fe and
I hit this dust storm that
I never knew we could have in New
Mexico. It was true. I
mean, I've been through dust storms and I kind
of cover my eyes even though, you know, the
windshield protects you and so
on. But you still feel like, oh my
God, that day
was bad. I'm
saying really bad. Um,
we couldn't see
enough to be
able to move aside
to park because
we didn't, we couldn't see the side of the
road and we couldn't see the next
car. I was
never fearful
as, as I was that day
because I really didn't know where
I was going.
And, um, it was
terrible and it lasted
for a good while. It wasn't like
just a swarm that passed
through and we were able to
see. It was pretty
scary right there by
um San Felipe
Butter Girls area
there. And my
God was I happy
that, that I was finally
out of it.
I kept wanting every little
like I move
in front or was behind me. I
didn't know if I was gonna be knocked from
behind or sideways
or from where it was, it was
just not a good scenario,
but I think that once you see
things like that you, you realize
how many changes are
happening and we need to address
them accordingly. Thank you to
the staff. The work.
That's all I have. Mister
chairman.
Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, Senator
and thank
you
being here.
Interesting. Was
it interest? Oh, I'm sorry,
I was gonna ask a question but there's
two people ahead of me, a
representative uh
Ellison followed by
uh representative
de La Cruz.
So go
ahead. >> Thank
you, Mr
Chair.
I was gonna ask if uh
New Mexico dot
was part of your discussion
and data collection
because there's some
information
and, and the
information that you provided
that they,
that we have been harping
on them for the past
six years in my
case. And
uh I'm gonna refer
to your slide
14
uh assessing climate risk
in New Mexico.
In my district. District
five,
there's 402
sites where
they are rated very high
risk.
There's a total of
887
statewide
and my
district,
it's almost half of
that. I
feel that we are
sometimes ignored
by New Mexico dot
Because we're always
uh bringing up
concerns just
over the and one
of the key points that I've been
bringing up for the past six
years sloughed
off again in the heavy
rains that hit New
Mexico.
We were fortunate that
that slide
occurred
about one o'clock in the morning.
So there was hardly any
traffic but
it was not discovered
and it held up traffic
when it started flowing for
over two hours
for the debris to be
uh cleared.
And the area that sloughs
off is a four lane
and it's separated by concrete
barriers. But
the slough off was so
big that it jumped
4 ft barrier
in the middle and covered the
four lanes.
So that is a
big concern.
The reason why I say is
a big concern is
because that
have been one
of the things that have been bugging
New Mexico dot
About for the past six
years. And I'm
just afraid that
it's even gonna get worse
because my term
ends in December.
And
I, I just feel that
the guy that's replacing
me will have to
relearn a lot of
things that I learned over the course
of six years and will
not push it as much.
I think that
also in that area is my
colleague, uh Representative
Garcia, he has
some of the same problems
and I think we
are two legislators
that really
um bug New Mexico
dot on proper rope
mate, that's it and getting
projects done in our area.
So that's why I was
asking if New Mexico
do. He was
part of the discussions.
Thank you, Mr
Chair >> Mr
Chair Representative. Um
So I I
think the next, you know,
if there's interest in us
continuing to provide
support or, or, you know, talking
to New Mexico dot
is would be on our list of
steps to do, you know, this,
we pulled straight from the report
and I guess, you know, I mean a
couple comments that I
think come to mind based on your
question and and the situation
is the
first,
you know, having the
data
I think can help
in
rating the pressure to address some
of these challenges. I think when we look
at that district, you know, it does
proportionally it has higher,
very high risk than, than the
others. You know, I think we're not
familiar with,
you know, the, the, the state of New
Mexico is sufficient to know why
that's the case. But that's something
that's in that report, that's in that
data and can be identified.
Where are these hotspots? What's causing
the hotspot? Is it
potential rockfall? Is it potential
flooding? Is it, you know,
it's, it's in that report.
Um I think kind of, I guess the
second point is,
you know, and, and I think this
also reflects what I said
previously
is
it does feel in many states that there
is this, you know,
gap in communication
between the dot
and the legislative process
and in
information's there,
right? They have this, they have this report.
It's the second one that they've done, they did one in
2020. If it's
not
being shared, it's not coming
into the discussion. Then an
important part of
what's happening in New Mexico is getting
missed. And then I think the
third thing is,
um, you know, we
have seen a lot of improvements
in state reporting
from, in, in particular from
federal mandates, you know, additional
requirements that state
dot s start
doing asset management plans, start
doing, you know, incentives
to start doing these resilience
reports. I think one of the
challenges that, you know, these
because these are federal requirements
or in federal encouragement
and focuses
on,
you know, state run assets
and it focuses on National Highway
System Roads and it doesn't
always capture what's going on at the local
level. And so even
in some of these, you know, I think
very useful and informative
data points, it's looking at the
state's owned roads, it's
not looking at the
roads that New Mexicans drive
on, you know, across the state,
whether it's state, local county
or, or whichever
hopefully, at least some of that's
helpful.
>> Representative.
Uh Next step, we have a
representative
delacruz.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. Should I introduce
myself first or the
viewing audience?
Good morning everyone. My name is
Art De La Cruz. I am the state
representative for District 12
which is in the heart of the South Valley.
And Mr Chairman, I have to apologize. I was a
little late getting from the
south side of Albuquerque
with the challenges and the repairs
going on in the
South Valley and getting to I 25
is very difficult.
So I was dealing with the roads
quite a bit this morning.
Uh Mr Chairman, my I
don't really have a question
per se but this
particular topic is incredibly
important
obviously to us,
but to all New Mexicans
because Mr
Chairman, the reality
is that most
everyone get drives
on our roads, the entire state
is on the roads and
we as a state
and as a government
are judged
by those roads.
And pardon the pun, I said this
this week earlier,
this is where the rubber meets the
road for the taxpayer.
If we don't do a good job with
our roads. They
don't think we've done a good job as a
government
and individually
and I have this conversation with
Representative Allison all the time.
Our constituents
are always asking
when are you gonna fix the
roads?
And so it is, it is an
essential topic. It's
something that we have to absolutely
continue to work on.
Thank you, Mr
Chairman.
>> Thank you, Representative.
And again,
I, I thank you for being here. Very interesting
and informative
presentation
and um
you have a
question.
Yeah.
Uh
go ahead.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair
uh on your
study here. Did
you take into consideration
the amount of drug traffic
that we have coming into New
Mexico?
You know, like right now
in my district, which we
will share,
we get thousands of trucks
every day coming into New
Mexico
and if you go on interstate
40 coming
towards Albuquerque, it is
a mess.
You know, I don't know, I don't know how many
trucks we get, I think
3,504,000
a day, maybe even more than
that. And this study is
that and you know,
you're looking at climate,
climate change and,
and blaming this and that on the
highways. But
in your study, did you take
into consideration the amount
of truck traffic we have coming
through the state,
>> Mr Chair I representative.
So
in the dot study, they do
look right. You know, the the
the three step process
is exposure,
what's happening with the roads and
bridges sensitivity
is that gonna break or damage roads
and bridges and then
criticality if this
rotor bridge is damaged
or, you know, or out of
commission, how, how
much does that affect the state? And
on that, on that piece, that
dot Study did look
at, is it gonna
disrupt, uh, you
know, truck traffics
throughout as one of the
things that looks at?
But in terms of,
you know, the wear and tear and obviously,
you know, the heavier vehicles, the, you
know, trucks do a lot more.
Um, you have a lot more
impact on the roads. You know, I
don't think it's, I don't think that aspects
part of this study. Uh, I
don't know if the dot is
separate things that they've looked at
considering, you know, which roads
are bearing the brunt of truck
traffic and
are they able to,
you know, address that and, and fix
it in a effective
manner?
>> Thank you for that Mr
Chairman. You know, it would be nice
if, uh, this meeting
today right
now would have dot
Here
who answer the
questions
because, you know, we're here and you're part
of it and dot Is not even
here. You know, we had a
meeting with Dat and on
LFC at all this week
and, you know, we
asked questions and stuff, but
right here they, they
can't sit here and answer none of these
questions. You know, I like
representative Allison said,
between our district,
his and mine, we have
almost 500
bridges that are
bad and you
know, that's recorders
of the whole
problem of the whole city in
Mexico and that very
unjust for
our constituents
that are seeing what's going on
where, how can we be left out,
you know, and that just my,
my concern. Thank you, Mr
Chairman. Thank you.
Thank >> you.
>> Oh, thank you, representative.
Yeah, I have a
quick comment.
A couple years ago I went to a
conference put on by the
Alliance for automotive
innovation funded
by most of the car
manufacturers.
And um big part of the
discussion was
uh options
for a
bill tax.
And the consensus seem to
be that uh
the road user charge
was the best option.
Uh The only pushback
downside I remember is
that people don't want
government to know how many miles they're driving,
which I found
and surprising
because
government and corporations
like Amazon and
Google know more about we
ourselves and we know know
more about us, they know about
ourselves.
So,
and of course, the registration
fee is not fair.
Some people drive more than others
increasing the sales tax is a
temporary solution,
electric sales tax.
My understanding is kind of
convoluted and complex
and expand. Tolling
obviously
is impartial.
You can't put tolls on all the
roads or do
you agree with that?
>> You know, I think if you
solved all the implementation
problems with the road user charge, it
seems that a lot of, a
lot of the research out there is suggesting
that that's a fair way of
allocating and those
issues are
people's concern about privacy,
people's willingness to, you know,
accept the, uh you know,
things that track back your
travel.
Um It does
seem you know, looking
at,
um, you know,
tolling,
um, you know,
and, and having it just, you know, the
fund, the funding coming from certain
roads, looking
at,
um, you know,
the
hiking up the registration fees,
you know, I think there's ways in which
you're, you're asking certain
portions of the state or the state's
drivers to bear a
large share of the cost. And that's,
that's a limitation of that.
And then when Pennsylvania looked at
this, oh, and I guess
on the last one on, on that electric
vehicle charging, you
know, we do
see states that have implemented. So,
you know, it obviously
there's some aspects that are a little
convoluted, but we have seen states that
are able to make
those pieces work. And
then when you looked at how, when Pennsylvania
was studying it, you know, I think they
decided they wanted to go for,
obviously the road user charges were
the bulk of what they identified, but they
wanted all of the above
strategy. Uh You
know, I think both to kind of spread that
burden as much as possible, but
also diversify
the revenue stream. So one wasn't
performing as well as expected
or had complications, there's
other things to fill
in that gap. Um
But different states are going to have different
answers about what they want to do.
Um I think all of these have some
implementation challenges
and you know,
but we are seeing states like Oregon
on the road user charges,
Montana on the
electrical vehicle charging
tax,
working through those implementation
challenges.
>> Ok. Well, again, thanks
for being here
and uh I appreciate
you making the long
trip
who are fly
overstate. You're
from Washington.
Yes.
Interesting again. Thanks
for being here
and next.
Uh
we
do.
Oh, ok. Uh I've been
informed that we should
uh prove our
minutes
now because we
might not have a quorum
later. There's probably a lot of
people who leave when
I
a presentation.
So move Mr
Chairman,
we have a mo we
have a
motion and we have a second
from,
from
OCH
second. Oh, I'm
sorry. And second by
representative
here.
>> Yeah. Yeah, mister chair, I
just wanted to talk
to you about
or comments
about the resilience
plan they were
presented. Um
I'm Dave
Harris,
uh Dave Harris, New Mexico
dot uh Executive
director of uh Motal
programs. Um
Just want to make a brief
statement that we
are in the process of
incorporating
resilience plan into our
design manual.
So it's a
process
as you saw, the resilience
plan is
just um
published in 2024
this year. So
it's in, in the process and it
will be incorporated into the design
manual where all the data
flows up into the
hotspots as well as
the way in which we do
design to increase
resiliency.
So, just a short statement.
Thank you, Mr Chair. >> Oh,
thank you for that. Would you be willing
to come to our sixth and
last meeting next month to make
a presentation regarding that
issue.
>> Um It's not in
my area of expertise,
but I will bring that back
and I'm sure we can accommodate that
request, Mr
Chair. >> Ok.
Thank you. Thank
you.
Ok. Next up, we
have
a
Harris chairman of the New
Mexico State Legislative
Board,
Brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineers,
speaking uh regarding
some rail safety
legislation.
Welcome Mr
Harris.
>> Good morning, Mr Chair
madam, vice chair,
uh members of the committee.
Uh Thank you very much
for your time this
morning.
Um Not
gonna lie. I'm, I'm, I'm fairly
nervous already this
morning. I don't
normally get to do this as my office
is normally the cab of a
locomotive at uh either
79 or 90 miles an
hour across the best, the
best state in the world, New
Mexico.
Um I represent
um a little over 500
members of
the uh are
part of the brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineers and trainman.
And you guys may remember
us a little bit from the
2023 session,
especially the two person
crew. Um that
was uh uh quite
the, that was the first time I've ever
stepped into working on any kind
of legislation and participating
in that process. And it was,
it was a,
it's one heck of a learning
experience.
Um, in that process,
we've, as we've moved
ahead, uh because
two person crew has
somewhat been resolved at the
federal level and there is a federal
rule in place. We felt it
essential to pivot and
move to other
issues,
um, that impact our,
uh, not only our membership but
the safety of the communities,
uh, that the railroads operate
through New Mexico.
Um, I'm a little bit
old-fashioned. I don't have the,
the fancy, uh,
computer
of, to be able
to do all this stuff
I'm doing this, the, the old
fashioned way. But our, our
proposed
legislation uh includes
limiting a train's length to
8500
ft, limiting
a train's obstruction of a
roadway to 10 minutes.
Uh It will mandate the
use of wayside detector
systems and it
prohibits
uh for reporting
non-compliance of these
events. In
addition to that, it provides
administrative penalties
for non-compliance.
And then the, the a separate
piece of legislation that goes
with this uh also sets
standards for how train crews
are transported uh
to and from the trains at the
best of the railroad.
Uh Why these bills are necessary?
One of the biggest things that we continue
to hear as we work
on anything that relates
to the railroad is, is the
issue of preemption. And
state law actually
outlines
um here
that the that they may
require railway companies,
transportation
companies and common
carriers to provide such
reasonable safety
appliances and use such
reasonable safety practices
as may be necessary
and proper for the safety of
employees and the public is
required by federal
or state rules.
Uh And as I mentioned, one of
the biggest things we heard
during two
person crew in
2023 was the issue of
preemption. Uh The
um at the federal
level, there are similar
law that, that states that
this, that the states have
the right to
regulate a, a local
safety issue as they see
best
um in
jumping into the pieces of
this uh particular
legislation, the risk of long
trains and the danger of
block crossings in the
interest of balance.
We do note that the total number of
de derailments have trended
down in the industry rec
recently. However,
this statistic ignores
the severity of derailments
that do happen. The risk
of catastrophic derailments
and their impact to
railroad adjacent communities has
also received significant
public awareness. A
recent study published
in risk analysis indicated
the following. Can a
train be too long?
There are almost
no doubt any possible
dangers posed by multiple
uh mile
freight trains now.
However, a new study published
in risk analysis shows that the
odds of a train jumping the
tracks increases
as the vehicle gets longer.
Replacing 250
car trains with 1 100
car train, uh raises
the aggregate odds of derailment
by 11%. The
study concluded. And
even accounting for
overall an overall
decrease in the number of trains
running, a 200 car
train would have a 24%
increase compared
with 450 car trains.
According to the study team's
calculations,
the study did not
analyze specific
risks that can stem
from train length including
airbrake issues, poor
train handling, slack
action and broken
knuckles. And when we talk about knuckles,
those are the actual pieces that
connect the the train cars
together. They look like a, a
big rusty hand at the end
of each car or, or
locomotive.
Um as the fr a
data that does measure this
uh train len by
number of car measures
this data by
train length. A as opposed
to the number of cars or
in linear feet.
In 2021
congress directed the Secretary
of Transportation to enter an agreement
with the National Academy of
Sciences, Engineering and
Medicine to conduct
a study on the operation of
freight trains that are longer than
7500 ft.
They reported the
following
trains frequently block
pedestrian and motor vehicle
traffic as they travel
through and sometimes stand idle
and highway rail grade
crossings to the
extent that the trend towards
longer trains lead
to fewer trains and aggregate
one would expect potentially
fewer blocked crossings.
However, a transiting
longer train will block a
single crossing for a longer
period than a shorter
train and is likely to
block multiple crossings
at the same time.
Train makeup decisions
and train l must be made
with ample consideration of the
capabilities and performances
of performance of the crews that
operate the trains. To
this end. Railroads have
introduced engineer assist
systems to control
trains by calculating
the best operating profile
for both the lead and
DP distributed power
locomotives. While
considering factors such as
the routes, grade and
curvature and the train's
length, weight and
composition, the
availability of these engineer
assist systems. However, do not
reduce the importance of crew
readiness and performance in
managing the handling
requirements of long manifest
trains in the varied environments
and territories which they are being
used.
Um As,
as we all know, New Mexico
has a lot of hills and mountains and
we, we travel over
all of those hills and mountains.
Um One of the stories
that constantly
gets relayed to me from our
Union Pacific membership
is that when they're uh coming
into downtown El Paso, they're
coming, it's downhill
um from Santa
Teresa and
as they come into El
Paso with a
train
1718
19 20,000
ft long,
this autopilot system
that they use on, on these
locomotives always
kicks it back to the engineer
because it doesn't know how to handle
that system and it does it at the
most inopportune
time, there's a 10
mile an hour curve right
under interstate 10
where, um,
if they have a derailment
as they have had in the past,
they're gonna take out interstate
10. Um,
now, thankfully that's
all that area is all being
redesigned. And hopefully that
will eliminate that in,
in, in the near future as
far as,
um,
the
taking out interstate 10
on that
block crossings are more
than a nuisance to motorists.
A train blocking a highway
or street crossing for an extended
period of time can significantly
hamper or prevent law
enforcement or emergency
services from
responding to a call in a
timely manner.
This effect is exaggerated
in small and rural communities where
a single crossing may be the
only option uh
to traverse the railroad
in 2019.
Uh in a
2019 study on
freight train length and associated
rail safety. The Gao
called on the Federal Railroad
administration to work with the
railroads to engage state
and local governments to reduce
the impacts of the long
freight trains on rail
crossings. This
matter has been significantly
or excuse me, sufficiently
studied to reach an informed
conclusion. All that remains
is for action to be
taken
in the additional
piece of the legislation that
mandates the use of wayside
detectors. A single
wheel bearing known as a
journal or roller bearing was the root
cause of the derailment and
subsequent toxic chemical
release in East Palestine Ohio
in February, 2023
estimates to clean this
derailment up are now in excess
of $1 billion.
Along with the disruption of the
community wayside
detectors are a technology
designed to read the temperature of
wheels, journal bearings
and brakes as the train
passes
because the railroads attempt to
govern themselves and no
additional standard exists
on the correct course of action. When
a wayside detector
activates,
we are proposing this legislation
to establish how many
detectors the
distance between them
and what course of action that a
railroad should take
in these matters.
Uh The location of the wheel bear
wheel bearing is shown to the
right and you'll see that
that's circle, that's actually just
a typical, uh,
truck that appears under
a standard freight
car.
And at the top of
the next page, uh,
shows
a parts diagram of a
journal bearing, uh,
without counting each
individual
roller
set in each of the cones.
There's 13
pieces that
make up a wheel bearing,
uh, on a train, on a, on
a train car. And then there's one at,
on each end,
26 pieces per
axle and one
of these pieces,
one of these 13 pieces
in East Palestine failed. And that's
what caused that
derailment
below. I'm not gonna get
it too far into the weeds.
I've, I've cited the, uh,
federal regulation for,
uh, defective journal bearings,
uh, for, for the ease of your
reference and what
you see there. Uh from
a down to
three, that's
all that exists in federal
law that
governs how to, how to
interact with
or how to handle uh
wheel bearing or a journal,
a journal bearing failure.
The average rail car has
eight journal bearings. The
average freight locomotive has
12 journal bearings.
Notably for such a critical
component, there
are relatively few rules
at the federal level and we
highlight the lack of any provision
requiring wayside detectors.
There's nothing at the federal level that
requires wayside
detectors. The
railroads can change and can
adjust that. And one
of the things that has come out
in, in the aftermath of
these Palestine is that the
railroad kept telling the train
crew just keep going, keep
going, temperatures changing
for the better, changing for the
worst. And in a lot
of, in a lot of cases, my
personal experience as a locomotive
engineer, they don't even
bother to tell us
if they detect that
you have a hot
journal. Uh,
they'll tell you when it's convenient,
they'll tell you when it's time.
Oh, you're, you're close to somewhere you
might be able to set that up. Yeah.
Ok. Traffic's slow
enough now. Ok. Yeah, you can do
that
now
in 2018,
uh Union Pacific closed
the downtown El Paso repair
shop. And the reason I'm citing the
downtown El Paso repair
shop is two of the three
directions out of El Paso
lead to New
Mexico.
They laid off 100 and 91
people. The very people that
did these inspections on locomotives
and rail cars that operate into New
Mexico Union
Pacific has only kept two
mechanical employees
uh since 2018,
they work varying shifts.
What happens when one of these two
employees go on vacation?
We've actually had an
instance where the fa
refused
to take action because
there was not a mechanical employee
on duty in El
Paso
because there's two of
them, two people can't
cover 24 hours a day,
seven days a week,
365 days a
year.
BNSF laid off
16 mechanical inspectors
in Belin, but it has
recalled them as of all
of, excuse me
has recalled all of them as
uh recently as July of
2024.
Both Union Pacific and
Bnsf count on wayside
detector technology to
monitor journal bearings.
However, because there are
no standards that the
railroads are accountable
for, they can instruct
the train crew to continue
moving. The railroad
may even elect to not inform
the crew of a potential problem at
all. Additionally,
BNSF has filed
for and obtained waivers for
extended haul trains.
First place that these
trains currently get inspected
right now when they leave Los
Angeles going east is Belen New
Mexico. Um
They're actually trying to
change this to where they can
travel up to 1500
miles between
inspections
and that's simply based on the use
of wayside detectors.
Um, the
administrative penalties for
non-compliance piece is pretty
simple. Um,
the purpose of having these administrative
penalties is to
designed to deter,
uh, future matters of
non-compliance by the
railroads. And
then the piece about, uh, the
prohibition against
reporting for any
non-compliance issues.
The railroads have tried to bully
badger and otherwise cajole
their employees into, uh,
not reporting
injuries and other safety
defects encountered
in the course of their working day.
Sadly, this is business as
usual for railroaders
and in order to foster
accountability amongst the railroads,
the prohibition of
retaliating for reporting a
matter of non-compliance is
necessary.
I have 28.5 years on
the railroad and I can tell you
story after story after
story of people
living this and
I'm in the middle of this process
right now.
Um,
the, the additional piece of
legislation that we wanna, uh,
get presented today is
also deals with how train crews
are transported.
Um,
typically, uh,
that is
handed out to
other, uh,
other subcontractors.
Um, they
use companies like Hacon
PT I and
generally when we get in these
vans, that that's a very
uneventful part of our day.
Usually it's either at the very beginning
of our day and we're going to get on a
train or it's at the very
end and we're exhausted and we fall
asleep in the back of the van. And
normally that's not a bad
thing. However,
train crews are all too
often subjected to vehicles
with several 100,000
miles on them drivers
that may or may not meet CD
L standards.
We have a driver right now
transporting, uh, our Union
Pacific membership in Vaughn, New
Mexico. It's on
oxygen.
That's against the CD L.
If, if for him to go apply
for a CD L
license,
he couldn't drive
yet. They're, they have
this man pressed into service
driving. I can
tell you a story, a
personal uh experience
where I had a van driver
show up
screaming and yelling and
cussing out the windows of his
van. He
pulls up and he gets out of the van and
he's a double amputee
and I have a great deal of respect
for that man for, for still working.
And this is not meant to be
negative towards him,
but as our trip
progressed, he
ultimately winds up getting sick
and barely gets off
the highway
at uh Holbrook,
Arizona
18 Wheeler goes by and rips
the door out of his hand as he's getting
sick.
I won't go into the further
details of that trip to say it
got worse from there to the point,
we had to ask to be
removed and put in another
vehicle because of how
sick this man was.
This is common
day in day
out
to the point. Uh The,
the small document that
appears uh next to the
text here,
um is, is a page
out of, uh, BNS F's, uh,
contract, uh,
that they've just, uh,
changed with
Halcon. Um,
it indicates that they've
waived uninsured
or underinsured
motorist coverage
in New Mexico,
Colorado,
Texas and Arizona
where all of our members are transported
to or from trains
if they've waived this uninsured
motorist coverage
or, which is a problem
in New Mexico and
we get hit in one of these
vans. Then
what
I have cited a few
examples of,
uh, some of the preventable
accidents that tie into,
um,
the uh first part of this
legislation and everyone
has heard about his palace
seniors, uh 53
total cars that were
derailed
and the root cause of
that was a failed journal
bearing Anniston
Alabama in March of
2023
was mechanical issues and
the train makeup of a long
train,
two locomotives and 37
cars were derailed
Manuelito New
Mexico. Uh in
a April
the causes ultimately
to be determined. But the
uh at least the initial
reports
indicate that it was either tracker,
a mechanical issue with a wheel,
35 cars and there were
uh five of the of those
cars uh that were involved in
that derailment breached and
exploded.
Uh Seor New Mexico in
March of, of 2024.
The cause was a broken wheel.
Um There's more than 20
cars were derailed but the
official count was, was never
revealed. Uh
Mississauga Canada
on the Canadian Pacific all
the way back to 1979.
This has been an ongoing problem
for a very long time.
Uh failed journal bearing caused
24 cars in a in a
Hazmat release.
Uh new swab in
Ontario failed
journal bearing. Uh February
2000, uh excuse me,
February of 1999
20 cars were derailed,
Livingston Kentucky
in November of
2023
failed journal bearing.
16 cars were
derailed,
Washington DC. Uh
May 1st
2016
had a, had a small Hazmat
release right near right near the
nation's capital. 15 cars
were derailed
and then Bedford County. Uh
the cause of the, uh this
particular issue was
uh makeup of a long train and
33 cars were
derailed.
In addition to federal efforts,
some of which has been led by
New Mexico's very own. Congresswoman
Melanie Sansbury, uh
with the
House bill, 1674
at least 19 states
have, uh, have considered
in or introduced
legislation regarding railroad
safety in 2023
in five of these uh
states, Michigan, Minnesota,
Missouri, Ohio and Utah have
enacted legislation.
States are considering such
measures as requiring increased
crew members on trains, limiting
train length, requiring
wayside detectors,
creating grade separations
and developing comprehensive
emergency response
plans. The attorneys
general of 18 states
and the district have called upon the US
Supreme Court to uphold state
authority to regulate blocked
railroad crossings and
prevent str uh stripping
states of their unquestioned
police power to regulate
grade crossings in the interests of
public safety.
Given the substantial bipartisan
action across,
excuse me,
given the substantial bipartisan
action across the nation.
The message to the
railway
address, the outline safety
concerns and work
proactively with state and
local governments to
protect the safety
of their residents and communities.
JD Vance. Yes, the
vice presidential
candidate and
Sherod Brown introduced the bill
known as the Rail Safety Act in
2023 which
was motivated by the East Palestine
derailment and is a
prime example of bipartisan
support that can take place after
a rail disaster strikes.
The legislation presented
today is not meant to reinvented
the wheel, but rather take what
other states are working on
and incorporate something
similar in New Mexico to protect
the communities and the people of New
Mexico that do this
work.
>> 00, thank
you,
Mister
Harris for being here
and now we'll open up the questions.
The first
legislature who wants to
speak is
representative
eight.
>> Thank you, chair. Thank
you very much for your
presentation.
Um
uh I
mean, the New Mexico
was founded and
developed through the
railroad and the railroad
continues to be
uh so much a part
of our
development and our
economy here.
So I, I can
see. Uh
and, and I, I very much
the safety being such a big
concern. I'm uh
pleased with your
update that the
federal government is
addressing the two
man requirement
for train. I
do appreciate that.
Um I, I would like
to um,
you, you brought a, a
ton of safety
concerns here.
How, because I know the
railroads are different because they have
a federal regulation
requirement.
Um,
when it comes to a lot
of the safety requirements,
I would think that your
union would be,
um, negotiating
for those. But you're seeing the
federal government is asking
each state to
qualify
regulation. It
just seems odd since this
is a transportation
that goes across state
lines, why we are
regulating a per
state.
>> Um, Mr Chair
representative,
the,
uh, in order
to get rail safety legislation
and, uh, and
get an interest in it.
Um Generally the Federal
Railroad administration,
once 23 states
have stepped up and
gotten something in
place, that's usually
an indicator
that there's a problem
that needs to be addressed. And
while uh the fa
has stepped in and started
uh studies and
completed uh
studies like with the National
Academy of Sciences,
um,
unfortunately, so much of what
goes on at the federal level is subject
to who's in the White House
and that's I, I'm, I'm sorry, I can't
give a better answer than that.
>> Ok. Thank you, Mr
Chair and, and thank you.
Um So,
uh I assume you have a
sponsor who's carrying these
two discussion bills
that you presented
today,
>> Mr Chair representative.
Uh We've worked uh quite a
bit with Representative
Hochman Vhi on the draft process
and we're working on the, on the
sponsor uh
piece currently.
>> Ok. Uh Thank you very
much. That would be the,
my only comments
is uh rarely if I
had a presentation that
involved the schematic
in the materials
and that was uh unique.
Um And that
when I first read these bills,
I was, I was concerned that
you were log rolling
too many items,
but they all are themed
on safety
and they're very practical.
And
um
uh and so
I, I, you
would have my support on. Thank
you.
>> Uh Anyone else wishing to
speak
Representative Garrett,
>> uh Mr Chair? Thank you. Thank you
so much for this presentation. It's
very sobering.
Um
especially as there's
various attempts. I,
you were on the,
the little train up
north when the
hook
broke down. Yes.
Yes, Katie's back there and
it's like it was just like
five or six cars and
all of a sudden the
last car was
disconnected
and, and it's like,
fortunately nothing
happened, nobody was
transferring between
cars and,
and I can see why
uh
Senator Vance is
involved because it's
Ohio
where the root cause
was a roller
bery. So thank
you for explaining how
important these small
parts are
and what can be done to
change things both with
human beings, but also
with advanced
technology that's really
paid attention to by
a human being. So, thank
you very much for your presentation
today.
>> Anyone else wishing to
speak
uh hearing? No, I have a quick
question. I, obviously
you're, you're unionized,
right, >> Mr
Chair? Yes, sir. That's
correct. >> Wouldn't
it be appropriate
appropriate to
negotiate the
transporting of
rain crews in your
contract,
>> Mr Chair, uh the
railroads subcontract that
business out and
it's uh, not currently
subject to collective bargaining
issues.
>> What was that again? That's
subject to, >> it's not
Mr Chair. It's not subject to
collective bargaining at this
time. >> What
this particular issue,
>> Mr Chair. Yes, sir.
The, uh, the van safety
piece. Yes,
sir.
>> I don't know. What am
I missing?
What we
just refuses to negotiate
on this item,
>> Mr Chair. It's, it's
not a matter that they refuse to
negotiate, it's that they give this
work out to a subcontractor
that, that works on their
behalf that provides
these drivers and has little
to no standards for
those drivers
and also does
not, as we've
cited with BNSF does
not carry uninsured
or under underinsured
motorist coverage.
>> I'm sorry, but I don't understand
it.
That shouldn't exclude it from
being a bargaining issue.
It's still bargain over
it just because
it's being private
provided by a private
contractor,
>> Mr Chair. Yes, sir. That, that, that
is, that is a possibility
um to this
point. Um,
the railroads additionally
will try and use Uber or
Lyft.
Um I've been personally
put in a Kingman cab
of Arizona
and the insurance
piece that an Uber or Lyft is
only required to carry is up to
$250,000 of
liability
insurance.
>> Sorry, I don't think the state should be
involved in union
contracts.
I can, you, can you
imagine if we, that set a
precedent, we got involved
in thousands
of union contracts.
The state,
we didn't have time to do anything
else. >> Mr
Chair. The legislation
that was proposed is currently,
uh, law in
Minnesota.
>> It's lost in Minnesota. >> It
is state
law in
Minnesota.
>> Well, just because
it's
as in Minnesota doesn't mean
we have to pass it
here
anyway. II, I
don't understand. I'm not
gonna be here next year. It's
like
I can't count on my vote
anyway. So
let's move anybody
else have any
questions
hearing? None. We'll thank you for
being here. We'll move on
to, uh, lunch.
