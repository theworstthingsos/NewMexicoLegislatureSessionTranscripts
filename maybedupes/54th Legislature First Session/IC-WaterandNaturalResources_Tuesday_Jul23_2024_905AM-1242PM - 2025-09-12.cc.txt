Good morning, everyone. Uh Welcome
to the second day of the first
meeting of the Interim Water
Natural Resources Committee.
Uh First off, I want to
thank um
uh James Jenez,
uh Charles Gooder and
Mexico Voices for Children
Action Fund. Uh
They sponsored our dinner last
night at
um ex
photo ex Novo, ex
Novo uh brewing.
Um And it
was uh it was a
nice or, you know,
outdoor uh
patio kind of thing. Uh
And thank you. Thank you to
them. And secondly,
I want to remind the committee
that um
after our last
panel today,
we have a
farm tour,
we have three locations
in Corrales
and we have a, are
we going to pass this out? We have
a for the members.
So we have a
uh invitation and
there's um on the back,
there's the itinerary,
there will be a shuttle
bus um
if you want to ride along with the
shuttle bus or the addresses
of the locations
are in the itinerary.
Um I don't think we have
any, they
haven't been passed out yet. They will
be um
I don't think we have any members here
today that that weren't here
tomorrow. So we don't have any
introductions, any
questions, comments or announcements
from the committee before we
begin.
OK, we're good. Um
So our first
panel this morning
is overview of New
Mexico food and agricultural
policy. Uh Generally
we go in the order that you appear
on the agenda. Uh So
first up, we would have uh
Kendall
Chavez
and you're going to slide
that right over. So it's directly
in front of you and that way
it's gonna pick you up better. All right,
great. >> Uh, chair
members of the committee. Thank you for
having us here today. I'm gonna keep
my remarks, uh, brief. I
don't have a handout for
you. Uh save some paper on
that front. Um, but I have
three other panelists here who will
provide a bit more detail and
granularity to what I'm gonna share this
morning as well as the following panels
before you all head out out in your farm
tour. So for those of you
that don't know me, my name is Kendall
Chavez. I'm the Food and Hunger Policy
adviser in the office of Governor
Michelle Louhan Gras.
Um I've had the great honor to
work alongside many of you over
the last few years and thank you for your
leadership on issues of food and
ag for those of you that
voted. Yes, uh which was every
single one of you for universal free
meals. Thank you for that support
for those of you that have on
appropriations. Committees that have
supported our request in the past.
Thank you for your support and
we look forward to working with you in the coming
session.
So I'm gonna give a brief background.
I think you many of you have heard this
spiel a handful of times. So I'm gonna
keep this brief. Uh My
work in the governor's office is
a piece of it is, is kind of
managing and leading the, the food
initiative, which is an
interagency uh partnership,
some of whom are on this panel
today alongside community
partner across the state to really
invest in New Mexico's food
system, both on the food
access, hunger side, as well
as the um the real need to
invest in New Mexico farm ranch
and food businesses. And that
we do think and we believe that
investing in New Mexico
agriculture and keeping that food
here is a really solid
way to move forward.
So we met with hundreds
of people for many, many
hours across the state. In
2021 you all
saw the first uh budget
request in the 2022
legislative session and each year
we've come back with a request
this last year in partnership
with you all. Um and the
key appropriations committees, we
secured $90 million
to not only implement universal
free meals as well
as to, to fund some of the key
program kind of marketing opportunity
programs that you'll hear about today
specifically on the second
panel, our
four key priority
areas, some of which overlap
with our colleagues in the Food Nag Policy
Council are as
follows. One, the
community, our community Food Program.
So looking at programs like snap
wic on on the federal
side, as well as the state side, making
those work for New Mexicans.
Our second is New Mexico Grown,
which we mean both the New Mexico
Grown program that gets local
food into schools, senior centers,
preschools, and food banks,
but also in investing in New
Mexico farm ranches and food
businesses so they can produce food
for those programs. So those are
things on the food safety
side, training side,
uh marketing side,
etcetera. The third
is supply chain. Uh
So really looking at
logistics distribution and
any regulatory policy that's
preventing progress in our food
system. And the fourth
is sustainability um
in a financial sense. So really
making sure these programs work
that they're supported with the right funding
stream. Um whether that
be recurring, nonrecurring or through trust
funds. Um and really
thinking critically about um
the the longevity of these
programs.
And um so I
wanna, I'm gonna briefly chat about
kind of our wins over the last few
years. Again,
excuse me, I'm not gonna go into too much
detail because you all would rather hear from the
boots on the ground than me and I'm very aware
of that.
So some
of our key programs
again, New Mexico Grow and I
mentioned this is our key kind
of legacy program in New Mexico
that we really truly should be proud
of. We're the only
state that
is um strategically
looking at again, the senior population,
early childhood population K
12 and our food bank
partners as one
kind of cohesive group of
individuals and partners working
together, moving in the same
direction. We believe
that while adding uh some
requirements for farmers
um may seem
burdensome if you didn't understand
the kind of details of the program,
what it's actually doing is prevent
is creating again, one pathway
for our really small scale micro
farmers and producers to access
these massive institutional
markets. We're very, very proud
of that program. And again, it's a legacy
program, other
programs that we that you all have
likely heard about in previous
sessions. Um Our investment
in senior farmers' Market nutrition
program, that program has been right
around 1 million year over
year um as
well as our produce prescription
program, which will have uh some
of our nonprofit partners speak to
today. Healthy food
financing, Aaron will speak
to um and others. And so
the, the top line, I want
folks just to understand this committee
last year with our massive
universal free meals request, which
that program is
critical uh impacts
hundreds of thousands of kids and
families every day while they're at
school. Um That was
a very expensive uh
priority uh for
us in the governor's office and for the executive
and for many of the legislators in this
body. So some of our
smaller programs got left
in the mix if you will um
in that shadow of that larger request.
And so I want to just call out and again, you'll
hear this today directly
from folks on how these programs are
actually working. And I
look forward to hearing that too.
Um Our senior farmers'
market is one program underfunded
by a million dollars. So that
program, we're currently finding
the, the the coins
under the cushions if you will to make
sure that seniors are continuing to get
their benefits to spend at
farmers markets throughout the summer.
Our state agency,
oh Department of Health is running that is
doing a phenomenal job delivering
food and CS A style boxes
to seniors to senior
centers. Um And we really
think that program deserves to be bolstered
up. The second is our
produce prescription program, which
again, you'll hear from others on how that's
working, um
was also under funded by
500,000. With
that committee members need
to understand that we also have
um secured a
1115 Medicaid
waiver to for so for the
Feds to essentially
fund food as medicine
interventions. So that,
that state, that state
piece will eventually be
covered with federal dollars.
But in this moment, there's a bit of a gap
and you'll hear about that directly from
farmers and our nonprofit partners
today. And
the third um is healthy
food financing initiative, which
again, we did secure federal
funds under the leadership of Erin or
De Goza and her, her
team at um the Economic
Development Department. But that's
another area that was underfunded
as well as New Mexico grown.
So that being the last piece,
um on the
senior side, those are funded
with nonrecurring funds
critical to the longevity of
that program as well
as um the K 12 program
at PED also funded with nonrecurring
funds. Uh You all will hear
directly from farmers how that's impacting
their businesses. We hear
all the time about the
power of these institutional
sales, institutional markets.
Um Again for our small to mid
scale producers all across the
state.
Um And the last thing I I
will say before I pass it off to my
colleague, Jason from the Department of
Agriculture is
uh while it's too early in the
season to say we're committed to
XY and Z priorities. I can
tell you that there is a lot of appetite
to um fully
fund all the food access programs
I just mentioned and really
start looking strategically
at uh priorities
that many of you share around young
and beginning farmers, veteran
farmers access to land and
water, um capital
and equipment needs. Again that you'll hear
from Erin or Goza about from
economic development Department
as well as the investment
in what the 50 year water plan
looks like on the AG side. So
what do farm and ranch food,
businesses need to conserve more
water and grow food for New
Mexicans. So that's kind of the direction
that we're headed as well as
interest in food waste. I saw
soil solutions presented to you all
yesterday. So also if committee
members are interested in those kind of concepts,
we're also thinking about those in the
governor's office. Um
So no formal ask again,
too early for any of the agencies
to say we need X dollar
amount and this is the direction we're heading.
But I wanted to give you kind of a high
level overview of what we're thinking about
in the, in the governor's office. And so with
that, I'll pass it to
um Jason from the Department of
Agriculture
>> morning, Mr chair members of the committee.
My name is Jason New, I'm the division
director of the marketing and development
Division at the New Mexico Department
of Agriculture. I report
to secretary director
uh Jeff Whitty, we're
based in Las Cruces.
Um
talk a little bit today, give you
some highlights on agriculture,
uh food and agriculture in our
state and can drive into
some challenges and opportunities
facing food and agriculture.
Um My
role as a division director, I
oversee them in, in the marketing and
development division is predominantly
market development, both
domestic and international.
I oversee our ag commodity
inspection program where we
inspect fruits and vegetables
and tree nuts for quality and
condition. We also
report our livestock
market news at
for sales across the
state. We
also do uh organic
advisory and we're
predominantly non regulatory
agency. Um
Some key stats that I wanted to
showcase and start us off
with
is um agricultural
sector output for the state
is 4.33
billion. That's up
24% from
2021.
Our crop and livestock pro product
sales in 22 total
3.71 billion
for the state which is up
17% from
2021.
We have 21,000
farms. Uh That's the latest
statistic in our census.
Uh That's a 16%
decrease from the previous
2017 uh
census and our average
farm sale size
increased to
1865
acres, which is up 15%
from our last census
to note and break down those
farm sizes. Um
um 33%
of our farms are less than
nine perce, nine
acres and about
50% of that is
actually um less than fif
50 acres.
Uh The latest statisticss
of 95% of our farms
are still family owned
farms,
land, uh land and
farms is uh is roughly
39 million.
We did see a decrease of
4% from the last
census. Um
Our top five crops
is in terms of
acreage are
typically our commodities. Uh
like hay and hail,
wheat for grain. Uh
corn for silage,
pecans comes in at number four.
It's 60,000 acres
followed by sorg and and
grain, which is about 39,000
acres. Uh
Generally speaking, uh New
Mexico is a
livestock and cattle
state. A majority of
our crash receipts are from
livestock or livestock
products. Uh We
had 1.3 million head
as of January 1st
2023 which
is slightly down from a 2022.
Uh less than uh we
lost 80,000 head.
Our milk cow inventory was
4.5% lower than the
previous year at
280,000
head. And our
beef cow inventory
was 1.5% lower than
the previous year. And roughly
450,000
head,
New Mexico ag ranking in the
US. Our top commodity
products are, are chili
peppers. Uh Number
two, just, just
uh just lost to California
this last year.
Um pecans at number
two, just behind
Georgia. We're
still a big uh
dairy producer state.
Our cheese production, we housed with
two of the largest chili um
or cheese plants in,
in in the world.
So we're ranking number
four onions or a
bit are being harvested right
now. At number five,
milk. We're still hanging in
there in the, within the top
10.
In the next slide, you'll
see um
that our shop
we, we, we pro
produce
annually our agricultural
statistics bulletin.
I've asked my staff to mail you
all hard copies of these for
your offices. Um
We produce this every year in
in cooperation with
USDA NA, that's the National
Agricultural Statistics
Service. So all
these data that I just
highlighted earlier can be found
here as well as the latest
statistics
going into challenges
I'm sure you've all
already talked quite a bit about
water. I just
put this slide in here
as it's the number one challenge
or considered a threat
to um state
agriculture is, is the
drought. Um about
86% of our, our
state is in some form of
drought condition.
Um And so
these, these, these numbers
here from the latest drought
monitor. Uh
N MD A has a
team that works.
Um and our drought
monitor group along
with our state climatologist
Office of State Engineer
and other state and federal
agencies.
And
so water one form or
fashion is, is a
significant part of
what's impacting, you know, our
ability to grow our, our products
and supply um
healthy, safe and nutritious
food to
our, our state constituents
as, as as well as the nation
and beyond. Next
slide is just a caption
from uh our
reservoir storage
levels. Uh
In short, I mean, the
takeaway is, is that our levels
are low and you can
see in the first two
columns when you
compare our current
reservoir levels
to what we were last
year and the majority
of them have
decreased.
Next slide, other significant
challenges. Um labor,
you know, 9% 19%
of our farms hire farm
labor. Um
The biggest challenges
um predominantly lie in
two areas
and that's for our
farmers uh or
producers to hire
temporary or seasonal
labor to
or just qualified
labor in general. Um
You're looking at about almost
60% or
farms fighting some sort
of labor challenge or another, whether
it's finding meat cutters
for your meat processors,
milkers for the dairy
or, or,
or labor to pick our chili
peppers. I mean, it's, it's
just been a constant
challenge.
Um Next is
broadband or internet. Uh,
where I think,
uh, latest
statistics, we're about 47th
in the nation for internet access
in our rural communities.
So we've got a lot of opportunity to grow
there. Um Farm
production costs, our input
costs for agriculture
are, are high and, and,
and, and, and getting higher
every year, whether it's the
cost of energy or
labor or
land or it's just a
very capital incentive
industry. Um
So you'll see
there that we've, we've, our
cost of farm have, have gone
up um at a state total, we're
about 2.5 billion. And
if you break it down to the average
farm level, we're about 100 and
21,000.
Next challenge is as a
shortage of rural vets in the
state, we just don't have
enough. Um We're,
we're, we're definitely
short um
especially on the large animal
side
going to opportunities.
Um Some,
some highlights, these are
again broken down
really in percent change
from our most current
census to the previous
census. Uh
Good news is the market of
values of products
sold is up
14 percent. That's 2.9
billion at the state level.
Uh Farm related income is
100 and 30 million which is up
100 and 4%
at the farm level. Um,
the farm average market value
products is 100 and 41,000,
which is up 36%
and farm related income
is, is 31,000,
which is up 27,000.
Um, really good news
and I think, which is,
is attributed to much of
what, what we've been doing under this
administration is, is
to, is a really an
uptick in our, our direct
sales, direct farm sales to
the consumer, direct
farm sales to retail
food hubs, uh
institutions
or the value-added size.
We're at 2 10.8%
of the last census, which is
up 2.3%
from the
previous,
I think. Um
I'm gonna go really into the
food initiative and this is some of the
aspects that, that Kendall
talked about a little bit earlier and,
and, and this kind of
these next few slides
really
iii
I think, you know, there
was a previous
uh what N MD A and
specifically in market development,
we were very heavily centric
on, on markets,
promotions, marketing, new
Mexico agriculture, market
development. But these
programs really have
hyphenated the development
side of what we do and reval
rural development or economic
development. And
so we've really expanded
and our, the grants
that we
received and how we're
deploying and how we have strategic
partners across the state.
And so we, we
received 4.6
million uh for
a USDA grant called the Resilient
Food Systems Infrastructure
co-operative Agreement.
We also got $6.3
million for USDA
local food procurement assistance
co-operative Agreement
and also through our
legislature and, and our work
with the governor's office. We
received 633,000
in 2024
to administer the snap double up
food box program
and $200,000
for their proof Sulo prior program
and 100 and 67,000
for two full-time
positions
go into a little bit more
detail on the
resilient food systems infrastructure
grant and call it RF
SI again. It's
a co-operative agreement with between
N MD A and USDA
AG marketing service. It
is one time uh funding.
This is uh ARPA
money and,
and this is a strategic
partnership with my colleague here
in the Department of New Mexico
and Economic Development
Department to
provide value chain coordination
activities and technical
assistance.
The program overall is
a fouryear program that
ends in
2027.
When you break down that 4.6
million, 1 million of that is for
equipment
and 2.7 million
for full infrastructure
programs.
We have submitted 18 projects
uh to USDA
12 are equipment only.
There is no match component to
that. So we're talking
about reefer trucks,
um blending and
fermentation tanks, walking
coolers washers,
baggers, kettles
and so on and so forth.
And we have six full infrastructure
uh um and they do
have a matching component to
that. There's one
distribution product to
capacity expanding projects
for aggregating and
processing
two incubator projects and
one a aquaponics
project. And I've included
a map in here with
some pinpoints and see where these
projects lie throughout the
state.
The next grant that I talked about
earlier is, is the Regional
Farm to Food Bank that's tied to
the USDA local Food
Procurement Assistance
program. Uh
Again, another co-operative
agreement between N MD A and
USDA. Um
This is a one time funding
and this has a fouryear
duration. This is going to be sunsetting
this, this coming uh
June 2025.
Uh Its purpose is to
procure food
uh and, and to distribute
it through our food bank uh
system.
And when doing that, we
partner uh
through two
state organizations
that's the Food Depot
and the New Mexico Farmers
Marketing Association.
Uh Right now on that grant,
uh we've spent 2 million to
date. Uh
Almost 1 million of that is
on meets uh or
67 62%
so far. And
right now, we're on pace to
expend 100% of those
funds. Um by the term
that that grant turn
out
uh unique to this buying
model. And one of my colleagues,
MEREDITH is going to talk a lot much
more uh in detail
about the regional Farm to Food
Bank is value based
procurement.
Lastly, uh is our uh
role in
the Double Up Food Bucks
program. Um This
is managed by
the New Mexico Farmers Marketing
Association. Uh
When consumers use snap
A BT card,
uh double up matches the,
the purchase dollar for
dollar and
any E BT holder is
automatically enrolled in double up
food bucks.
Um For
fiscal year 24 we again,
we got $1 million
so far, we've deployed
680,000 of
that. And right now, we're
prosecuting invoices and we
expect to
fully utilize and,
and, and pay out the
entire $1 million.
Uh Average monthly participants
for fy 24
were 9163
participants.
And that concludes my
presentation.
>> Thank you for that
next up. Uh
Erin
Hugo is
a,
you're gonna need to turn that
on.
>> Great.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Good morning,
Mr chair and members of the
committee. My name
is Aaron Ortigoza. I'm the
Food Hunger and Agricultural
Program manager for the New
Mexico Economic Development
Department. And
I am very pleased this morning
to present to you about
the food Hunger and
Agricultural Program.
Um Some of
the uh successes
to date um some of the
challenges as well as uh where
we're uh intending on
growing the program too.
So we'll
start the program mission
um is uh to support
the inter intersection of economic
development in New Mexico's food and
agricultural sector with
increased food security for
New Mexicans.
And so this program is part
of the Governor's Food Initiative.
And um the role
uh for Edd
in the initiative is to focus
around the economic viability
of um uh
farming ranching
and food enterprises in
the state. And
so we, we'll be focusing
on the development of financial
tools and technical assistance
tailored for the small and mids
scale food processing and
agricultural enterprises.
As well as working to increase
access to food for historically under
resource comu communities
and addressing workforce
development cha challenges
in the food and agricultural supply
chain. A lot
of the project goal areas also
seek to strengthen and diversify
in-state market channels
um for increased access
for the small mids scale food and
agricultural operations
and to um
increase the food safe
storage aggregation capabilities
um regionally throughout the state
as well as distribution and
transportation networks uh
connecting those nodes of
aggregation.
And um at,
at core to
all of this is to support producers
in the implementation of regenerative
agricultural
practices.
So the next slide is
um an excerpt
from the New Mexico
Comprehensive Economic Development
Strategy Plan.
Uh The sustainable and val
value-added agriculture
is one of the target
industries for develop that is
highlighted in this um
in this plan for the economic
development department and I've pulled
a few excerpts from the plan that really
speak to the work that we're doing
in this program. Um
We're highlighting a need for technical
assistance and financial tools
that are tailored um and
customized specifically for
these food processing and agricultural
operations.
And it's notable that agriculture
particularly sustainable
and regenerative agriculture
is um
it, it, it's has
significant upfront costs
and inputs associated with
that um such as
appropriate infrastructure and
heavy machinery.
And um it's imperative
that these um operations
are able to access capital
in order to procure
the appropriate
machinery for their
operations.
Um The stakeholders
in that were surveyed
through this plan have indicated that
this industry remains
well positioned. Although
the state um community
partners as well need to
focus on near and midterm
opportunities
to invest
in financing mechanisms,
educational technical assistance
programs and continued
industry relevant infrastructural
development.
The um
working toward
the capabilities
for this development will
increase food processing
capabilities which we all
um are aware uh
could incur
increase the ability
for producers to
um diversify
products and cycle
their food products within the
state.
The next
slide
highlight some of our legacy
financial programs and E DD.
So you're all likely
familiar with Leda and
Jtip. Um So
this is a summary
of um project
investments in Leda and Jtip
over the last two fiscal years,
which are the two fiscal years that the food
hunger and agricultural program has
been active. So
Lida has awarded 10th
projects. Um
Jtip 19 projects,
Lida has been able
to invested
3.33 million,
375,000
and um Jtip has
been able to create
271
jobs awarded through that
program. Now,
these, these legacy
financial programs
are, are quite important
for the economic um
sector of the state.
Although they'd present
challenges and eligibility
for small and mids scale food and
agricultural businesses,
um particularly these
two programs are focused on
manufacturing or value-added
agriculture. Um
So that
essentially
precludes food production
operations from being
eligible. And one of
the ways that I uh remember
this is that they uh Lida
can't help reraise the cow,
but they can help you make the cheese.
And so again, we're talking
exclusively value-added
manufacturing um
eligibility for that program.
Both programs are designed for
economic based businesses. So these
are companies that are exporting at
least 50% of their prod
of their uh product or non
retail services out of state.
So, again, when we're talking about in-state
market channel opportunities
and circulation that again is
not aligned as
well with these two programs.
Um Also retail businesses
do not qualify. So
we are focusing on
increasing uh food
retail in rural and
underserved communities through
grocery stores, cooperatives
other other retail
operations. Again, these are not
uh qualified projects with
under Leip and J
Leda and
Jtip. And uh
Jtip requires full-time year around
positions to qualify. So when we
talk about agricultural operations,
there's seasonality,
part-time
job opportunities. So those may
or may not also um
qualify under these two
programs.
So the
um
role of the
economic of the food hunger and
agricultural program is to fill these
gaps and to expand eligibility
for these types of businesses
in our food and ag sector.
Um Under the program, we
have four current initiatives
that I'd like to spotlight the
um New Mexico Healthy Food
Financing Fund is a
cornerstone grant
program that is a
strategic phased
approach to developing a suite of
financial tools that I mentioned earlier
that are tailored to um
agricultural food
businesses. The
resilient food system infrastructure
program that my colleague Jason
mentioned is
um EDD is
a uh partner implementing
this program as well. And so we
are working with our,
with N MD A to address
middle of the supply chain needs
for uh
locally and regionally produced food
products and in order
to benefit the consumers, producers
and rural communities by providing more
options um for
better markets for these
um agricultural
products.
Another initiative that we've mentioned
is America's Healthy Food Financing
initiative. Um I'll speak a bit more
to this in a minute. But this
is a um
the USDA America's
Healthy Food Finance Initiative, New
Mexico was one of uh
16
projects awarded nationwide
um to
implement this uh
inaugural program
to invest in
local capacity and capital
to grow partnerships between
public private organizations
working to
provide financing and technical
assistance for food, retail, and
food supply chain businesses.
The last initiative is the
socially disadvantaged farmer and rancher
access to capital program.
This is a um the
Community Development Finance
Authority and the National Association
of Departments of Agriculture
Foundation um are
working with New Mexico as
well as um as well
as the state of Minnesota to
pilot um
really innovative um
tools and uh
financing tools to
address barriers that
um agricultural and food businesses
have faced in the past. So this is a three
year grant we are entering in year
two.
So what we're hearing um
again, we'll pull out the top five
focus areas through the RF SI
survey results that were
conducted in fall of
2023. Um
Again, expanding the capacity
for processing and food aggregation
and distribution, um
modernizing
facilities and
um supporting the construction
of new facilities
are very important
to the community stakeholders
as well as
um uh
employing
technologies that are climate
smart in uh in
supporting businesses to access
those technologies for food nag.
OK. And
so we're also hearing that there's
reluctance to take on long-term debt.
So this is one of the focus areas working
on traditional or
nontraditional lending
options. And
I'll go ahead and move to the next
slide. This
is a um map
showing the
inaugural round of
awards through the Healthy Food Financing
Fund. In fy 23
we were able to award
13 projects um
throughout the state of
510,000 total.
And our total
ask um from the
72 applications was
over 4.7 million.
And then the Fy 24 awards
are on the next slide.
In this, we were able to award
20 projects throughout the state.
Uh We had a total of
950,000 and
over um that we were able
to award and um
6/6 0.5
million though were total requests
for these projects.
OK. And the last
slide,
so the New Mexico Healthy Food
Financing Fund Partnership
is um
the
uh this, this
project is a
um it's
a collaboration amongst five
organ um organizations
in New Mexico comprised
of Vita Maor capital E
DD, um New Mexico
State University, Santa Fe farmers'
Market Institute and
the loan fund. And
so we were awarded
3 million over five years
to um conduct
market studies evaluate the needs
of the food ecosystem and
design loan and grant
programs and technical
assistance to accompany those
uh capital programs
to improve sustainability and
resiliency for local healthy food
retail and food retail supply
chains. Um
We are kicking off
this project in August
2024. And
so we will be
um we will
be providing
updates and um doing
outreach initially for the first
year to um
to work with the
the
stakeholders.
So in your packets, I won't go
through these, but these are spotlighted
awards of the Healthy Food Financing
Fund, their ca their case
studies of the different projects
that we've been able to fund thus far
to give you an idea of um
how the program is working for
people in community and how
these impact investments
are, um
how these investments are
impacting our food and agricultural
businesses.
Thank you and that concludes my
presentation.
>> Thank you very much. Uh
Next up, Susan Wil
Wil
Wilder.
>> Good morning, Mr, chair
members of the committee. My name is
Susan Wilker. I'm the
past chair of the New
Mexico Food and a Policy
Council. Um
The Food and a Policy Council
was formed in 2003.
It is the
all this continually
running Food
and Egg Policy Council in the
nation. I've been a member
for over 16
years. I'm
here today to give
you an overview of our recently
released New Mexico Food
Charter and soon to
be released Food
Charter report card. Everybody
should have an electronic
copy of the Full Food
Charter in your packets
and we do have some hard
copies um
uh printed out through
Sarra. So if anybody actually
wants a hard copy of the
full Food Charter, um those
will be available to
you.
So uh the Food Charter
is a product of New Mexico
uh of the Policy
Council strategic plan.
We began strategic
planning uh
cycle back in January
of 2022 and spent
nearly 12 months of
planning with input from
our leaders members and
partners. The strategic
plan was passed in December
of 2022
and included three goals
and nine strategies to
achieve those goals. One
of the plan's goals
is to ensure that our policy
efforts align with the
Policy Council's
values, mission
and purpose. And one
of the strategies to achieve
that goal was to create a Food
Charter.
On the next slide,
you'll, you'll see a highlight
of what the
one back. OK. No,
there
on um this
slide, you'll see
uh really what the purpose
of the uh charter
is. It really is
designed to
set priorities based
on the Policy Council's mission,
values, equity
and area areas
that we feel um
impact our food and egg
systems. In New
Mexico, it will
guide our decision making because
every year we get
um we, we're a small
but powerful group and we have
limited capacity. So it'll
actually serve
as a screen as to
which um
policies we're, we're
able to support
as well as guide
um decision making in
terms of where, where
gaps in our systems
are.
We'll use it to advocate
and educate because this is
a public document. And
along with the report card,
we'll make sure that this is
distributed so that
people
can see the
information in the rationale
uh behind the
Food Charter. Uh
It'll help us build
partnerships because you'll
see as you look at
the Food Charter, the various uh
priorities. And there are
obviously certain
people that we want to continue to
build our partnerships with
and finally to monitor
and evaluate policies
related programs
because um you'll,
you'll hear shortly
that we do have a
specific
outcomes
and, and
it's really are
those policies and programs
having the intended impact
and are there unintended
consequences that
people need to know about?
So this next slide
really is our approach
or the framework of the
uh Food Charter.
Um There are three
priorities,
four key
main strategies
but not exclusive that
we use in our policy work
and 18
outcomes.
The uh we went
through a six
month theory of change
process which
involved once
again our, our leaders, our
partners um
agencies,
our members
where we
were able to
look at, you know, what is,
what is the change we want to see
in our food and a policy
systems. And we
came up with these three
areas which we feel
significantly
influence our food and
egg systems. The
first is nutrition and food
security. The
second, environment, conservation
and climate, the third
government support and
infrastructure. All three
of these are interrelated.
You cannot have one without the
other,
our policy
strategies mainly but
not exclusively focus
on food areas. I
mean 44,
yeah, focus on four areas.
One is state legislation
including appropriations. The
second is federal
legislation and
appropriations.
Um The third
is our policy
administration and
implementation and
uh lastly, agency
rules and regulations
um beginning on page
10 of the Food Charter.
When you look at the full Food
Charter, you'll actually
find a table
that summarizes our
priorities,
our outcomes,
our indicators and
the policy strategies
around each of those
um outcomes.
We have a total of 18
outcomes that are
associated with the three
priorities.
And these are really important
because even though policy
approaches may change
over the years, our
outcomes, what we
want um the
future ideal
food and egg policy
systems to look like
in the next five years
shouldn't change.
So um those outcomes
that are really important,
we have about 60
indicators that
um are associated or
correlated with uh
each of those 18
outcomes.
We hope to um
provide an annual update
to the Food Charter which
lists our major
policy strategies
that we support. You'll
see in the Food Charter
that um it
really is our roadmap
and our guide in different
um uh
areas, policy
strategies that we can take around
those three priorities.
The accountability section
of the Food Charter will
be carried out through an
annual Food
Charter report card and
we're just in the process
of finalizing that
report card. So you'll
be receiving that
hopefully within the next
week. So we'll make sure
that um we follow
up. So the
report card shows
the results and the impact
of the policy council's
work. Uh Obviously,
we, we don't, we work
very, very closely with
um agencies, the office of
the Governor, our partners
and our communities throughout the
state. Uh The
data collection and analysis
is used to show
trends, patterns and
correlations
and who benefits and who
doesn't. And the report
card will be updated
annually.
Um The next slide
slide five, this
shows just um
highlight some examples
of what you can expect to see in the
report card, we're
looking at supported
legislation including
uh budget information that
pass uh
those that didn't
pass any kind of
any current rule
making and then uh
selected outcomes
where we're seeing and
tracking, we do have uh
baseline data.
And so we'll be looking for trends
and patterns wherever we
can.
And then uh the next
slide
is
in this, these are some
of the areas that the
Policy Council would
like to see addressed
during the 2025
legislative session.
And I think you've heard it
from my colleagues this morning.
I think there's a lot of agreement
of, of these areas that we feel
are extremely important.
One is promote nu-
nutrient rich
food. This is especially
to Children, youth,
seniors, low
income families
and to our food banks and
food pantries.
Also to improve access
to nutritious and
culturally significant.
New Mexico Grown food,
we'd like to see
um New
Mexico grown
expanded
is uh together with
raised farm and ranch
products.
Enriched,
enrichment of
the soil and water to
grow food is really important,
especially given the climate
conditions we face
and also to allow
farmers and ranchers to mitigate
the impact of extreme
climate because we're seeing
that more and more. And we're
hearing from our members that
this is an an extremely
important uh
thing that we can
ignore. And
finally,
last slide uh
does list some
specific uh programs
that we're looking at.
And as Kendra
or Kendall said
earlier. Um
We are in
the process of
working and collaborating
with our members, our
partner
organizations, communities,
um legislators, also
the governor state
agencies in formulating
specific as.
But this will just give you an
idea of some of the things that are
on our radar
and that concludes my
presentation.
>> Thank you very much. Um
Going uh to the
committee for questions. You're
gonna turn that mic off when it's
not in use. Uh
Senator
Stefanik,
>> no,
good morning, Mr,
chair members of the committee.
Thank you for the presentation.
All of you. I'll be
try to be very quick because I'm
sure other people have lots of
questions. My
first two are
comments.
It's the first one is about
senior food and it's not
just about our
initiatives
years pretty many
years ago, 5 to
10 years ago, somewhere in that
time frame, the federal
government cut the money
to the aging
departments.
The state never made that
up because at that time,
the state didn't have the
resources, but the
state does have the resources
to make that up
when the federal
government cut the money
and the state didn't ante
up it cut
quite a bit of
quality from
the food in the senior
centers and the home
delivered meals. I
have some constituents
receiving three
frozen meals that are
exactly the same for
the week. So
I would ask us to
put that back into the
mix. Uh if it's
not part of the food initiatives,
at least to pass it on to the
administration.
It might be time now to
think about a trust fund
or a fund for
food
where either a
percentage of
the corpus is brought
down every year or
the interest, but we
are setting up funds for other
areas and
it might be time to think about
that since we have um
resources.
Um I'm gonna throw out the
questions I have and then you
can all respond.
Um I'd like to know
what support
we have for grocery stores
in small communities.
Uh Are there any initiatives
for young farmers
to enter into the
field? And
could we work with game
and fish or the livestock
board to
bring in uh meat
sources for our food
initiatives?
>> OK. So I'm gonna jump in here.
We can't have you all respond
to each question.
So, so like we
have three questions
who's ever best for each
question? If you could give a quick
response, we ran a little long
in the presentations. We're a little pinched
on time and we have a lot of members
who do have
questions.
Do you want to repeat your first question?
>> Uh The grocery
stores in small communities,
young farmers and
working with game and
fish?
>> Mr Chair Senator Stefani.
Um Yes, for grocery stores
and small communities. Um that is a
priority area for the Healthy
Food Financing Fund. So
half of the 20 awards, 10
awards were given to
um both cooperatives and
independent retails um
throughout New
Mexico and
um continuing upon
that, our National
America's Healthy Food
Financing initiative is aimed
at increasing um retail
opportunities as well
for and underserved
communities. So that's the beginning
of the fiveyear program that we have
$3 million to implement
the public private partnership. So we'll
be working with our
existing network of
um independent and cooper food
retailers and ideally
building out a community of practice to
help them also support one
another through mentorship type
opportunities. Um those
that have been around longer, maybe providing
um insights into
new or starting up
um groceries and
uh food
retail.
>> Sure. Um Mr
Chair Senator
Stefani's, uh I can
comment on, on both those
uh I think from the N MD
A um standpoint
on the young farmers
and ranchers. I mean, there's definitely
federal programs and resources out
there for that.
But uh at our level,
we, we try to focus it
on that with our agri future
institutes which we're gonna
be putting on again.
Um This October
in Las Cruces, uh we
focus on support to our
F and our 4h partners in
the state uh as
well as our um school AG
programs
um as
we are uniquely affiliated with
New Mexico State University. We
work very closely with our extension
partners and our College
of Agriculture
um
on the
um topics
of the game and fish
and the livestock
board on getting meat.
I, I don't know that
I could fit exactly to that,
but I know that
it can go into our, like our
food food bank programs.
For instance, if it's um
processed in
a uh meat
processing facility that is
either USDA
uh federally in a grant of, has
a grant of inspection through a USDA
F SI S
or um
or possibly when
our state and inspection program
gets up and running. Um you
know, it's as long as a certified
inspection from one of those programs that
could go into the value chain as
well.
>> Well, the reason I bring up that
question, thank you for those responses,
everyone but
um for
the excess
um
game
that we have in the
state, in some
parts of the state, not
all parts,
um it was brought to
my attention that maybe this
would be a use
for
low-income
individuals who qualify
for sub you
know, subsidies. So thank you for
that.
>> Thank you, Senator. We have
um about 10 minutes
left and six people on the
list. Senator Woods
for a couple of minutes >> very
quickly, very quickly. I
don't understand what you're saying.
First Mr Chair.
Thank you for bringing this subject
matter forward.
I am
a happy camper.
Thank
you
first
kindle.
I need some
support
for
a, a
highered
initiative
to bring some
veterinaries back
into the state
with a uh
loan repayment
program for their
student loans,
uh whether they're in
state or out state high
school students if we can
get some
vets back into our
state. So I would
appreciate help
with that.
Jason,
I've talked to you in the past
double up food
bucks. Let's have
some protein
there.
We, we should be able to
do that, uh, chicken
or, or beef, we
should be able to
do the same thing. Double
up food bucks for
that protein in the farmers'
market.
I know we've talked
that
we haven't got very
far,
Susan
on your,
on your deal here,
you talk about
water statement, your
water statement.
You, um, do
you understand
the consumptive
use of
water? I'm
assuming
the agriculture's consumptive
use, >> Mister
Chair and Senator
Woods, we do have a
water committee. So
and, and they
formed that water
statement and so
I am not the expert on the
water and so
hopefully, but we
can get back to you with regards
>> to do
because so many
times it is said that
agriculture uses
80% of the water in the
state.
Agriculture
uses the
consumptive use that that plant
uses
and that's all they
use. But
thank you for that.
And
Aaron,
I love it,
economic
based
businesses. I
love it. I
hope the committee
understands what we're talking
about here. How
do we bring money into
our state? How do we
drive businesses
that sell
products outside of our
state to bring money
back into our state?
And agriculture is,
is a very
good promoter of
that. And thank
you for that. II,
I understand when you say,
well, we can't
raise the cow, but
we can sell the
product from the kelp.
And I know Doctor
Flores is needing uh
uh someone
to run his
meat uh labs
to, to teach
people and
uh in the state how to be
meat processors. One
of the steps to,
to get meat processors
across the state is
to have someone trained to do
that. And it's kind
of a funny deal. A
Corona at one
time their high
school did meat
processing
their high school
and, and it was
fundraiser for that
uh FA chapter, but it
was also a
uh a training
facility for
every kid that took that
program
and they took in
local
animals and they
processed them.
But again,
Mr Chairman,
thank
you,
>> thank you, Senator Representative
>> Kates. Uh
thank you, Chairman and thank
you for your presentation.
I think this is so
impressive uh
that this initiative
has had such a
short uh roll
out and such a significant
impact and, and I
want to make sure that's the
first thing you need to say when you're making
that presentation. Um it
is very impressive.
Um I uh I, I
do also think that it's
a wonderful
um a
model for
a government,
private sector and
nonprofit
collaboration.
So, thank you very
much. Um
What I think I
heard Jason. So please
correct me if I'm wrong is
that we've had
slight
decreases
in like our
cattle and some of our
products, but yet
we've had pretty
significant
increases
on uh the
saless. So in
decreases in the production
increases in the
sales. Um
Is this
directly, do
you believe that this is directly
because
of the direct
marketing that is
occurring through this
initiative? By,
by having
local fresh produce
in, in the schools and in
farmers' markets, being able
to use government subsidies
for fresh fruits and,
and, and
Vegetables,
>> Mr Chair um
President of Kes. Yeah, I, I
do, I do believe
that a lot of what we've been
doing
um under
this administration utilizing
state funds that,
that we have received or,
or federal funds
has had a debt correlation
to that direct
sales uh component.
Whether it's, you know,
pushing the, the, the what
we're doing with our institutional
markets, whether
it's promoting um you know, our
locally grown
foods and, and the
various marketing segments
here in our state and
nationally.
Um and,
and, and driving home, you know,
getting more evaluated vertical
integration in our production,
um more of that product
that's grown on the farm is
actually going direct
from there to the consumer.
Um It, it was, it was
low, it was, I think
6% in the last
census. And so
I, I do have a correlation to
what we've been doing
has had a driving effect to
that in the positive fashion. I do
know that on the production
side, you
know, when we look at cattle
numbers that is
definitely tied to
drought, but we have
seen the value of our products
go right now. Cattle sales are
good. The market is
strong but,
but, but, but our producers
on our livestock side are
preparing for those, you
know, grazing conditions
and that drt, you know, issues that we're
facing. Thank >> you so much.
I'm so sorry. I just, I
I've got a couple more
questions and so we got to
tighten
up there. One is you say
that there are
labor
shortages, I'm
gonna probably
assume there are always
labor shortages in
agriculture,
but it
seems to, since you're reporting
them, they are historically
lower.
And um,
and so what do you
attribute to that? Is that wages,
is that benefits, is that
not enough, uh,
individuals looking
for jobs? I know we
have some of the
lowest unemployment
historically for over 50
years. Why, uh,
why do we have a labor
shortage in
agriculture?
>> Mr Chair Representative
Kates. I, I think there's,
there's a lot of driving factors to
that. And I can only
kind of tell you what, what I'm hearing
from our producers.
And I'll give you an example
is in our chili pepper industry.
It's, it's highly, you know,
our, our, our that product
specifically when you're talking about
the fresh market, the green
chili or the fresh green chili
that is a hand
pick
commodity.
And so to,
to find that labor,
your sole vehicle for that
case is H two
A and that's
not an easy program to, to
manage for our producers. And it
is costly because of the
requirements that come with
it. And so
to get that contract labor,
it's predicts, you know,
seasonal migrant labor
large largely is
extremely difficult to get
in the first place. And
second, it's hard to harder
to even get it at the right specific
time because that
chili pepper has to be
picked and harvested
at a very specific time to
make market. So
that's just one example of
many that some of our
producers are facing on
the dairy side of things
they can't find in these rural
communities, milkers,
you know, feeders
and they don't qualify
for H TWO A and
so they just struggle
constantly and that's a long term
issue. I'm just
find finding workers.
>> Thank you and
Mr Chair, I won't ask these
questions, uh because we
don't have time for it, but I want to send
it out and please get back to me
afterwards. Um
First, I do want to make a comment
is I for one will
always, I'm more than
willing to pay more for my green
chili to make
sure that it's Harve. Is
it? Um uh I,
I want to say there's two
projects that I
are near and dear to
me and I, and I'm
looking for uh
funding and ways to
help support that from
many different areas.
Would this also
fit within this initiative?
One is uh
you talk about
uh uh healthy
soil programs.
So many, many of the kraus
areas have orchards.
So it's not
feasible for you to
let them go
follow, you know, for a
year or two. These are, these are long
term decades
investments
but but
seeding the orchard
itself with
plant life that is not
going to be food
but will help with water
conservation
and being able to keep those
orchards
healthy
during
I
like to know whether or not
that is something that would
be and you
don't have to answer this right now
and yours and as
well as setting up
local small
commercial doh
certified kitchens.
Because if we're, if the
initiative is to do direct
food to individuals,
you know, the
opportunity for New
Mexicans to share their
grandmother's salsa
and, and be able to
know that uh that
it is being canned and
being able to be marketed
in, in a out
of state way, I
think is a commercial
investment that
would fit within
this mission. And so I would
love to speak with you afterwards and
thank you for your indulgence, Mr
chair.
>> Thank you, Representative Kates. Um
So, so the mistake that we
made yesterday
in sort of in this agenda is
that we have really good presenters
in too tight of a
time frame. So we have four presenters
an hour long. We are
at time. We
have four members left.
Um I want to give each member a
chance to ask a question.
Uh I I ask that you
keep it to a minute or
two Representative
Armstrong and then, and
for the panel, please keep
your your answers brief,
Representative Armstrong. Thank
>> you Mr Chairman. Of course. He
said that right before I
ask questions. Thank
you so much for your all
the information. I'll be
quick. Um
The veterinarian shortage,
uh Senator Woods, I'm with
you. Let's get some legislation
together. And Kendall, we would love
for you to help us with that.
Also uh for the loan
forgiveness. But also
on the tax credit side
of the veterinarian shortage,
we only give tax credit
if they were, if they
graduated from New Mexico and
come back to New Mexico. I think
that needs to be changed
because we
allow nurses and
doctors and everyone else
to not be born and raised
in New Mexico and come to
New Mexico and get a tax credit.
So that's something I'm working on
would love everyone's support
on that. Um,
let's talk about the
double up food bucks with
protein. Senator
Woods hit on that.
Also the co op
map. I'm not real
happy with this map because
it seems really lopsided
in one central location.
Nothing to my ao's
friends, but it seems
really lopsided. The
second map,
uh, looks much better
and I believe, uh, ma'am
from E DD. I, I
apologize. I don't remember your
name.
Um,
uh, Erin, I
wondered it when
we go back to this.
Uh, I, I did some
rough math on the first one. They
got about 42,000 each.
On the second one. They got about
45,000. I know
for a fact it wasn't split up
that way. I would like
to have a, a
list of all
of these entities and how much money
they received
because I'm not sure that it's
balanced and I want
fairness. And
so when we go back and we're getting
this asking for more
money from the Appropriations
Committee, which I sit
on,
I'd like to see
are we making
sure that they are stood
up and, and
working and that
everything is hunky dory
because if these people
fail, that's,
that's a sentiment to us not
doing a good job.
And so I want to make sure that
they, they thrive,
um especially
the ones in very rural,
New Mexico.
Um
And let's not forget about New Mexico
meat inspections
and let's get that going and
let's get it stood
up and, and let's
start
help New Mexico
feed new Mexico
in our senior centers in our
schools, uh everywhere
else and, and
let's get this going because
New Mexico needs
this and
I appreciate so much all
that you do. Uh
I'm a cattle rancher
myself and
uh it's a tough, it's
a tough gig.
My husband has a another
job to support his
ranching habit.
So uh which we
love and we have raised our
Children to love and adore
as well. And hopefully we grow some
more here in New Mexico.
Thank you, Mr Chairman.
>> Thank you, represent herb, sorry,
represent, >> thank
you. And I will
be brief. I just want to thank everybody for all
your work and everything you're doing for
our, our farms. And I just wanted
to make a quick
um out of
information. Uh It's
predicted by the year 2050
we're gonna have a population of 9
billion uh people.
Um which means we're gonna
be, we're gonna need an
additional 170
million acres of
farmland to meet our demand,
our food demands. Um
Right now, we have
a South America size
uh area in our world
for uh crops, food
crops and
another African
size of land for
livestock. I just want to give us a
perspective of, of
those things and, and the need and
the demand it has as it's
growing.
So my question is
Mister Mister Chair
is when we're
looking at regenerative farm
practices and
you don't have to answer this. I'm going to ask
you offline because it's going to take up too much time.
I want to know what those best practices
we have now and what we need to plan
for the future. I want to
say for
our
group that's here if
you're monitoring or if you're looking
at policy out of
Wyoming, and this was
brought up by Senator
Stefani
on the food
from the field
program which
processes
wild meat
elk primarily
and then prepares and
donates to local
organizers
um to meet the demand
of hunger in
that state. So if you could look
at that on your policy list, that's all I have.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
>> Thank you, represent Lujan,
represent
Perreira.
>> Thank you Mr Chair and
thank you panel for your great
presentation.
Um I just
wanted to
um to
tell this body
that uh I represent a
district in both the Rio Chama
and the Rio Grande flow through
my district And on, uh,
June 20th
we had a, a
huge storm, probably
eight inches of rain
in about an hour or two.
And it just,
it, it, it made the
Rio Chama jump its
course. I don't know. There is,
there is some news about this
but not, not a lot because
at the same time the
Rio dosa fires were just
raging. Um
So we have a lot
of small farms that
have been covered in
mud and
silt from this river
overflow. It's, it's
huge. You walk out and you
see small herds
of Angus standing in water.
You'll see beautiful
old pristine
orchards that are standing in
water. Um
We did a lot of work
to try and get remedies for
that and we brought out
the bureau of reclamation.
They brought out these huge machines
that's only six of them in the
country that can go in
and change the course of a
river and we almost
got it back and done and
then another rain came
and it flooded it
again. So I just, I
brought um this is
just one small story
of, of the
ACU um district that
had um the
ACU um
the
Pueblo Acu
who had got done
everything right. They got the
money for uh from the water
trust fund. They built a great little
head gate for the community.
It was infrastructure that had been
needed for years. They got
350,000 in
2022 and
they did everything right. They
had just opened
up this little head
gate and dam and,
um, that night the flood
came totally
ripped it all out. So
I'm just saying as,
as people who work
on water and conservation,
I think we need to think
seriously about
infrastructure for,
for, um, water
in the north, in rural
communities. We don't have
it. We did allow
for the tribal infrastructure
fund. We have money for the Colonial
infrastructure fund.
We do not have money
for rural infrastructure
in this state. And I think it's necessary.
I'm just passing around these pictures
so everybody can just have
see the damage. And then I have
one quick question and I know
I'm over time, but I
just wanted to know there's
a program in Wyoming, a
food hunger program
and I think it's one we may
look at as you know, Elk are a
huge problem
for farmers and ranchers
in the north. They're,
they're, they're now calving
in the, in the Rio
Chama river
in acu and
when and when and
when Elk calve
in water, you know, they're going to
stay there. I'm just saying
Elk overpopulation
is a huge problem and we
have a conundrum due to the
anti donation clause
and the policies of the Fish and
Game Commission and,
and, and what they did
in Wyoming
is that they
harvested and produced
these Elk who have been
a nuisance to ranchers and
farmers and then
they sent that Elk meat
out to local food banks. So,
has anybody
considered that kind
of program? And
are, are, is anybody thinking
about that? Thank you, Mister
chair,
>> chair. Do you want me to answer? I can
talk offline too.
Um Chair
members of the committee Representative
Herrera. Um We
had an example. Roadrunner Food
Bank approached the state a few years ago
to do something similar
um when the Mora
fires were raging up north a few
years ago. And so I think the the state
is interested in that kind of concept.
We'll be happy to work. It sounds like a handful
of you are interested in that, so happy
to follow up.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. That's all I
have. I could
go on for hours, but that's all I
have. >> Thank you,
Representative
Herrera for not going on for
hours. Representative
Romero, >> thank
you, Mr Chair. Um
I don't know who to direct the question
to Pers E and I
looked, tried to look up
the uh report card,
um couldn't find it. So I'd love a copy
of that. Um
I'm interested in trying to
think through
the sort of we
were talking about the circular economy
yesterday. And when we look at the
programs of
food that can be distributed to
our schools, can
we meet that demand? And then
if we think through some of the other
anchored institutions, our
hospitals, our
universities, our big state
buildings, are we able
to feed the folks that
are, you know, among
the largest
buyers, right?
When we're thinking about procurement,
how we regenerate this fund
in, in the state? Are we
able to meet that demand? And
do we have a report or any
information or data
regarding um
how that's
going?
>> Chair? Um
Representative Romero,
I would say,
you know, a uh senator
a few years ago, about five years
ago, grilled myself and
others about that same question,
I won't name the name. Um
And the answer is no, we do
not. The current buying demand
and the capacity of our farm and ranch
producers are the ones that do sell
to the state market.
It's completely out of alignment.
Um And the nonprofit folks
will tell you the same thing. And so we have to
continue to build that capacity, which is
why all these programs are so critical.
Um There has been no deep
analysis, I don't think
even out of N MS un MD
A on that question. So
I think we also would be interested in
digging into that further.
>> Excellent, would love to do that.
And I know our Phila
philanthropic organizations
are eager to understand that
question as we again
dive into procurement and,
and how to create these systems
um for purchasing
in state. Thank you, Mr Chair.
>> Thank you uh represent
Romero. Um And thank you
to our panel and I'm sorry,
we were a little rushed
today. Um
So we're our next panel
is local food production and food
security. If we could
uh if you could join
us at the front table, I'd appreciate
while we're doing that, we
have um a couple of members
who have joined us today. Representative
for Herrera. Would you like to
introduce yourself?
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
Uh My name is Susan
Herrera. Representative, Susan
Herrera. I represent
the counties of Rio
Ribas, Santa Fe Sandoval
and Taos. And
um good to be with everybody
today.
>> Thank you and represent
part.
>> Um How does
this work?
Is it good? OK. Uh
Thank you, Mr Chair.
Uh My name is Representative
Christina Bara and I
represent Bernalillo.
Um That's sort of the middle
of Albuquerque Lomas
to Montgomery
Coronado males.
Um And really excited to be here today.
Thank
you.
>> Thank you. And our next
panel, as I said, is local food production
and food security.
Um
Do we have
five?
Who are we missing?
Ok.
OK. Well,
that makes the panel a little smaller. That's
not entirely a bad thing.
Um But we do have,
we're, we're running a little late, we
have four presentations.
Uh and, and there's
always a robust questions.
So uh we're gonna go
in the order remaining
order that they, that you appear
on the agenda. Uh
If you could keep your
presentation to 10 minutes or
under, I would
appreciate it. Uh First up Denise
Miller, Executive Director
of the New Mexico farmers'
Market, New Mexico
Farmers Marketing
Association.
>> Terrific. Thank you, Mr
Chair and members of the
committee. Thank you so
much for this opportunity.
My name is Denise Miller.
I'm the executive director
of the New Mexico Farmers
Marketing Association.
We're a nonprofit that for
30 years has worked
on behalf of farmers
and ranchers by stimulating
markets and creating
healthy communities across the
state. I'm going
to present on three
programs today
and you will also hear
from two producers, Mr
Manny Encina and Mr
Bryce Townsend who
will speak to program impacts
from their ground level
experience. I'm
going to try to provide the
20 of the 40,000
ft overview
and I have prepared
comments so that I can try
to keep this presentation
short because it's a lot to
cover. And
so um the three
programs that I'm going to
present on are
double up food bucks
produce prescriptions
and the New Mexico grown
approved supplier
program.
Um I'm gonna
address what makes each
of these programs
uh unique, but I
want to start by telling you
the three elements that they all
have in common
and not all of this is in
the presentation. I didn't really
create slides, you have
handouts for the
individual program. So
sorry if it's not a
direct,
you know, representation
of what I'm saying. But
first, all three
programs create sales
for farmers ranchers
and food producers. This
includes direct sales at
farmers markets, farm
stands,
CSAS
and other outlets and
wholesale opportunities
through the New Mexico grown
the state's farm to Institution
program.
Secondly, the three
programs all support
nutrition, access for
vulnerable populations.
And third, all three programs
leverage a additional
resources, federal
grants for program
services and
infrastructure support such
as you heard from Erin or
to Goza the Economic
Development Department and
Jason New at the Department
of Agriculture.
I'm going to try to be especially
brief on the first two
programs because
the approved supplier program is a
really multifaceted
program. So
and I did not prepare a handout
for you on double up food
bucks. You heard a little
bit about it from Jason
and this program has
been around for a
while. Um The NMF
MA manages the
statewide program
that gives dollar for dollar match
for snap participants
buying new Mexico grown fruit
and vegetables.
Some of the things that I
think Jason might
not have covered
are that there's nearly
800 farmers who
are signed up to
participate in the
program.
Um There are close
to 80 locations where
snap shoppers can use the
program that includes
farmers markets, farm stands,
grocery stores and
C SAS. There's
about 84,000
individuals that benefit from the
program each year.
Over the last four years, the
programs generated about 5
million in sales
and that's about 9 million
in economic impact.
The program leverages
3.3 million in federal
funding, another million and a
half over the last couple of
years in private
funding.
And I do
want to just briefly address
Senator Woods your question about
protein because
there is nothing we would like
better than to be able to
add protein into
the mix for the double up Food Bucks
program. It is,
we tried to get
approval actually from
the Food and Nutrition
Service and
it is not allowed
federal. The federal
program does not allow
there to be match for
protein. They allow match for
dairy grains
about everything
except um
meat and those type of
proteins. We are
in the process of trying to figure out
a creative solution
to that. Um by working with
the Department of Agriculture
and creating a pilot
that maybe just provide.
So it wouldn't be,
we've got to find a creative solution
is the bottom line because it
is just not allowed
as part of the federal
guidelines where we do
match. So it's
complicated but we're working
on it because there is nothing
we would like better
and we don't need any
new investment from the state on
this program. So we're, we're
good, we're good on that
front. I am
now gonna hop over to the
Produce Prescription
Program and
um you've got a few handouts.
This was something prepared by the
Department of, of Health.
There are
um
let's see, the Produce
Prescription Program which
was funded by the state in fiscal
year 23 and
24 at a
level of 500,000.
It's designed to support
nutritionally at risk
populations such as
Children, pregnant people
and tribal populations
with healthy food options.
Local, when available.
The funds were awarded each
year to three organizations
that ran the program slightly
differently as best
served by their individual
communities. The three
organizations that were
funded each with
166,000
each year were
CPE in Gallup that ran
a corner store program.
Presbyterian Health care
that connected health clinic
patients to farmers'
markets in northern New
Mexico and the New
Mexico Farmers Marketing
Association that connected
health clinics and diabetes
educators in 11
tribal communities with fresh
local produce. Together.
All three programs served
about 2600
families and individuals a
year and purchased from
around 80 farmers each
year. All three partners
also leverage federal program
dollars for related
programs. As
you heard from MS Chavez earlier.
Unfortunately, that last
year, this program fell
through the cracks
and our three
organizations along
with all of the health clinics
and partners who really came
to appreciate the program
will be respectfully
asking for new
funding to continue this
important food is medicine
work. And
again, you will hear from
Mister Bryce Townsend in a little
while who is
one of the farmers who really
participates in that program
as well as Mister
Encinas who will
speak to
that.
So, OK, I'm gonna take
a breath and the New
Mexico Grown approved
supplier program,
uh the approved supplier
program
um is a really hard
program to cover in a short
amount of time.
As you may see
by the presentation. It's
the separate
um presentation
that, that you should
have in your hands.
It um it is
designed to create
equitable producer market
access while
ensuring food quality,
which you know, otherwise known as
food safety for
institutional buyers
and the food banks.
In addition to providing
a variety of producer and
buyer services, one
of the key roles that the
NMF MA plays
in stewarding. This
program is the market
and agency relationships
and providing stability
and institutional coordination
for all stakeholders.
In short, the approved supplier
program is the glue
that holds together many
of the moving parts of the New
Mexico Grown
program.
The core partners
of this work, I guess I
won't worry about what's up on the
screen. So um
the core partners of this
work are
the New Mexico Public Education
Department, the
aging and long term services
department, the
uh EC CD early
childhood care and
education department
and the food banks along
as uh along with
the food is medicine
programs.
So and it's also
extremely important to know how
many community partner the
program engages across the
state, whether it's the
food safety training network.
The desk auditors who this
year reviewed about
270 farm
risk assessments or
partners who helped develop the
program guidelines. We
couldn't do the work without
all of these talented
individuals and
organizations.
Um Before I
go on to describe
how the program works,
it's also important to know that
in the six years, the
program has been in
existence. It has
grown tenfold.
Um that includes
sales. This is really important.
Um The sales have
grown from
500,000
to 5 million
projected in
2025.
The number of buyers has
grown from 75
to 275
and the number of producers
from 45 to
270.
And also the eligible
products that the
uh buyers are able to
buy have also expanded.
It grew from
was what was originally
fruit vegetables and
legumes to also
include meats,
which include um
beef, lamb, mutton
and pork.
And soon uh value-added
products will be added into the
mix. So
how did all of this growth come
apart? Uh come, come
about, there's
uh an amazing staff
and support partners across the
state. We have
dedicated agency
support at the public
Education department, aging
and long term services,
the food banks and EC
CD, the investment
from the legislature
um has been
really key to
this. Um The I
think farm farm to schools
maybe started with about
86,000 a
decade ago.
And um it now
includes, you know, several million
dollars each year and
this is what helped the program
expand to be able to include
meat and other products.
Um and support for the
from the Governor's Food Initiative
has also been integral
to the program's growth.
So the program
provides so
many core
functions. Um
These are at the top
of page three I don't
know if you've got this
presentation in your
handout somewhere, I
assume.
Um Sarah, this
was what I sent you. Yes,
the other Friday,
this was the presentation
on it that
so if you don't
have it, we'll make sure that you
have the digital version.
There are also a lot of
links in the
presentation so that you can
even find more information.
Um So
the core functions
are producer
support and that
includes things like food safety
training, onar
technical assistance,
value chain coordination.
There is buyer support
which includes developing
purchasing and nutrition
guidelines, procurement
and production planning, data,
and evaluation
and um
you know, important things
like developing a uh
tracing and
recall uh
program. Uh
Finally, the program
also leverages the other
state and federal resources
such as those you heard about
from Nmedd and N
MD A um
and the meat inspection
program and
more.
So um
sorry, you don't have the presentation
right now, but on page
four,
we put together
what a real simple
um or as simple as we
can make it graphic about what the
producer and buyer journey
would look like. So if you were a
producer, what you do
to participate in the
program, if you're a
buyer, what it looks
like? I'm not going to go over
that here.
Um We also
had what was not
a simple um ecosystem
map. Um I'll just
like show this to you
really briefly
here, this
and this was our best effort.
You, you will have this to
simplify what is
really a
complicated
system of many
programs. So
hopefully we'll have an
opportunity to have separate
conversations, our staff
and, and talk with you all outside
of this um forum
to give you more information about
that. And finally,
the approved supplier program
also provides producers
with gap readiness
and fa compliance
and it's really a shining star
across the country.
Um As Kendall mentioned, there's
really no other program
like this across the
country
and
um
it has the unique power to
create market opportunities
for local producers
to address food
insecurity while fostering
food sovereignty for
sustainable change
and food access at
the, at the community
level. Um We
are, I think the approved supplier
program is proving
that the local food value chains
are stable and adaptable
and that they can address
unanticipated food
shortages by
diversity diversifying
the supply chain for both
farmers and institutions.
So again, you have a
digital version where
you can go to links that
have a full
impact report on
the approved supplier
program. And
so to close, um I
do want to say that the
approved supplier program
will be looking for new funding
this year and
um we will be um
bringing an appropriation bill
forward when it's
appropriate.
And um yeah,
so since 2021
we have received 200,000
to run the program. But with
this um tenfold
growth, we just haven't
been able to keep pace. So
thank you for your attention
and your support for these important
programs
and that concludes my >> remarks.
Thank you very much. Next
up. We have Manny
Encino
MS Miller if you could turn your
mike off and Manny if you could
turn your mic on.
Thank you. >> Good
morning,
Mr, chair members of the
committee. My name
is Manny Ensigns. I'm 1/5
generation rancher who
along with my
wife kna are blessed to raise our
Children on the Buffalo Creek
Ranch and Own
Trilogy beef community located
southwest of Moyer, New
Mexico. I'm
also blessed to be the executive
director of the Santa Fe farmers'
Market Institute, which is a
501 c three nonprofit
organization who
owns and manages the farmers'
Market Pavilion
in the Santa Fe rail
yards.
The Santa Fe farmers' Market Institute
creates and administers
effective programming for farmers
and ranchers as well
as consumers in a 15 county
region of northern New Mexico
spanning from the Arizona
line
in the in the west to the Texas
line in the east.
The largest consumer based programs
at the Institute of Ministers are focused
on improving equitable access to
locally grown vegetables,
fruit and meat,
providing consumers an opportunity
to use their snap benefits at
the Santa Fe farmers' Market
and doubling their purchase power through
the double up food books program is
a win win for both
consumers who need more access to
fresh locally produced
food and farmers and ranchers
looking to get more of their New Mexico
grown food on the tables of New
Mexicans
in 2023. As an example,
the institute redeemed more than
$370,000
in double up food bucks
just through the Santa Fe farmers'
Market.
Mr Chair and members of the committee,
fresh locally produced
fruits and vegetables are key to a
healthier New Mexico
at the Santa Fe farmers' Market Institute.
We believe it's a right for every
New Mexican to have access to
fresh locally produced
food. The fresh
Rx and senior wic nutrition
programs are perfect examples of
how we can continue to
fund and
administer fresh food programs
that benefit the most vulnerable
populations of our
communities.
Going forward. One of our top
priorities at the institute
will be to continue partnering with
state and federally funded
agencies to create more equitable
access to locally
produced
food
in keeping my remarks
short. I'll
close by
saying to
each of you as members of this
committee and the state legislature.
Thank you for
believing in and supporting the New Mexico
Grown Program.
I've spent my entire career in
New Mexico trying to figure out
ways to keep
agriculture alive
and uh what an amazing
opportunity to rebuild the not
only the economy of agriculture in
New Mexico but rural economies
throughout the state.
My family continues to be
blessed as an improved
supplier in the New
Mexico Grown Program.
Not only are we putting beef and pork
on the plates of school, school
kids, seniors and those less
fortunate serviced by the Food
Food Bank Network.
Ladies and gentlemen of this
committee, we are stimulating
economic growth in communities
like Moyer.
The New Mexico Growing Program
is returning by our analysis,
94 cents out of every
dollar that comes into my
pocket. And ranchers
like us are able to reinvest
in small family owned businesses
throughout rural New Mexico.
This is
working
direct to consumer agriculture
like the New Mexico Grown Program
and the Farm to Food Food Bank
Program which MEREDITH will visit
with you to you about
are creating hope for the future of
a healthier New Mexico
and keeping New Mexico agriculture
alive. Thank
you.
>> Great. Thank you very
much. Uh Next
up, we have Price
Townsend
>> would.
Good morning, Mr chair and
members of the committee.
My name is Bryce Townsend.
I'm the owner of Black Mesa
Farm, which is located,
which I created as an
LLC in
2022.
Um It is an eight acre farm
located located
in San Felipe Pueblo
and has been in the
family for four
generations.
I became a full time farmer
in 2012
and began growing
specialty crops in
2016.
In 2022 I
began working
with New Mexico Farmers
Marketing Association's
Fresh Rx program
on a 16 week produce
prescription
program.
In year one, we
provided
150
produce packages
which served eight
pueblo communities
um from
OK, Oene in the
north
to South Lipi Pueblo
in the south.
Um In year two,
we grew
and in
the size of the operation and
provided 330
produce packages
which served 10 Pueblo
communities.
Uh We added
two in the South Isle and
Laguna. Uh We
also added
one navajo communi
community which was
to Hajali and
one
native urban centers
here in Albuquerque, which was
the first nations
community health
source
um to walk through the
system logistics
of the program. Uh
Black Mesa Farm
with two other
farms and one
orchard provided all the
local grown fruits and
vegetables
that went into the
packages.
Black Mesa Farm
aggregated and packaged
all shares at the Roadrunner
Food Bank
which also
provided cold storage
and floor
space for
packaging.
The shares
of
Mo Mo Mobile
Grocery which also
operated at
Roadrunner Food Bank
provided delivery
services for
the Fresh Rx program
to first nations
community health source
and three
drop-off sites
on a northern
route.
Uh The Indian Public Cultural
Center provided
also provided delivery
service and they served
the two Southern
communities.
Um
So health, the health programs
in each of the communities
that were receiving the packages
um distributed the produce
to, to the recipients at
the end. So that was the more
or less the um
general operation
of how of how
we ran that program
um in the current year.
Um We are now
we're down to
serving for Pueblo
communities um
which will
also
um provide a
cost match for the
program. Um
And then one, the
urban Center here in
Albuquerque.
Um So we're down
to 100 and 41
packages that we'll be able to
provide this this
year.
Um
Newly though Black
Mesa Farm will utilize
the Indian Pueblo Cultural
Center's new Entrepreneurial
complex, which is
gonna be um
completed in the
next couple of weeks and
we open up for
operation. They'll
provide the cold storage
space, uh
processing area
and also the packaging
um space
to, to run the
program.
Um
Black Mas Meso
Farm will continue to
aggregate from the same two
farms and
the one orchard
here in New Mexico.
Um
So I'll conclude
with saying, along with providing
native communities access
to local grown
fresh produce,
utilizing agricultural
lands and exercising
their water rights is a
priority
in, in optimizing
the overall health
and wealth of the
people. Thank
you.
>> Thank you very much.
Um Brandon
Devine.
No. Where are
the
sorry. I just looking at the wrong
list.
>> Uh Thank you, Mr Chair
uh madam, vice chair members
of the committee. Uh
My name is MEREDITH Lorenz
and I help to run the
regional farm to Food Bank
program, which
is the newest iteration of
the NM grown program.
Um, what kind of
makes it different is that it's
currently?
Sure.
Is this better?
What?
Mm.
How about now,
um, what makes,
uh, the regional Farm to Food Bank
program? Um, a
little bit different is that it's currently
federally funded. Um,
and that program that,
um, Jason and
MD A described a little
bit is, uh due
to most likely sunset,
June 30th of
2025.
Um
You know, the program,
uh
the heart of the program, it
connects local producers
to the emergency
food network and
that's really interesting and
different. Um It's a kind
of a new model in food
procurement for food banks.
Um The context
of this is that uh
donations
um food sources
for food banks have gone
down um pretty
drastically. And for
the first time, food banks are
actually having to go out and procure
food. And so this is a
program that allows
food banks to be really thoughtful
about the,
the uh food
that they're procuring and
who they're, excuse
me, who they're procuring from.
Um Just to note
on the handouts, this one
of course is the talking
points. Um
The next one here is a
internal um
annual report that the
Regional Farm to Food Bank
team compiled.
A few of the statistics
are a little outdated, but there is
a lot of great information in
there about how the program is
run Um
And then I have another handout
here which actually
um Manny's on
it.
This is um a
national publication
from the Wallace Center.
Um They are a
uh kind of a
food system uh
leader
uh
program that um
works on food system issues
nationwide.
Um So when I say that
we've gotten some national
recognition for this program,
um You know,
it's a, it's a huge testament
to the collaboration, the cross
sector agency
collaboration that has really made
this program successful.
Um That's with the New Mexico
Farmers Marketing Association.
I just can't, I just can't
stress enough how important
the approved supplier program
is to this
program specifically,
it is the quality
assurance and
um uh
food safety piece
of this um
super important our
partners at New Mexico
Department of Agriculture
um have
been amazing uh
partners in this
and um we just really
couldn't have done it without their
support.
Um And then
also uh
the Food Depot and the
Association of Food Banks whom
I work for were
the ones that are actually, you know,
on the ground procuring the
food. Um It
takes all of us to
make this um program
as successful as it's been.
So there
are 100 and 80
producers that we've been
able to purchase from either
directly or indirectly through this
program. And I do
want to stress that this is a
statewide program.
Um We are
purchasing from
all over the state and
the food is being distributed
into every single
county uh
in New
Mexico.
Um We are
on track uh like
Jason said, just to
spend the full amount. Um
there is supply
for, for food
banks. Um And as he
mentioned, there's a lot of protein
that food banks are procuring through
this program that could
otherwise have not been uh
procured.
Um Protein is
one of the most requested items
from folks that are at food
banks. Um And so this has
been a really important um
program to be able to
supplement that.
Um We've
spent 2 million to date.
The rest is basically
through agreements and
also through some informal purchasing
opportunities, we're
on track uh to,
to be able to spend all of
that.
Um
a note about how it's
distributed. So, one
of the kind of the superpowers
of food banks is that they're
able to distribute
into places in the
state that don't have any other food
access. Um
be it retail
uh outlets where they
can use their snap dollars.
Food banks are really able
to go in
and um service
areas that could otherwise
not, you know, be serviced.
Um
So there's over
500 partner
agencies in the
state um
nonprofits that we rely
on to actually do the distribution
and that is happening everywhere. It's
happening in all 33
counties.
Um Just
to know kind of about how the
program works. Um
We
employ kind of a
philosophy uh when
we're doing our purchases
to not just look at the bottom
line price, um which
is kind of historically how food
banks have been
forced to uh procure
food. We look
at um you know,
different attributes we really
care about, you know,
aligning um
our values with
uh purchasing
from small socially
disadvantaged producers, which
is also part of this federal
um LFP A program.
And um
folks that demonstrate
sustainable land management
practices and safeguard natural
resources. We, you know,
food banks are able to
um be able to
support these producers
through this
program.
So we
will um
be asking
uh for
continued funding. Um
We, you know, food banks
have really
benefited from this
program. Um
You know, we've loved
uh being with uh in, in
relationship
with local
producers in these
kind of these hyper
um local
purchases that have
happened. Um
For example, in, in
Kron County, there's three,
there's three food pantries
there. Um
We've been able to coordinate
with the frontier food hub
to actually go up there
during the distribution
times um
to be able to coordinate because
those pantries don't
have cold food storage
capacity. So there's
a lot of coordination
that goes on through this
program um
to link local
producers with
the um partner agency
sites that are in every
single county um in
the state.
So I'll leave it there. Thank
you so much.
>> Great. Uh Thank you
all for your presentations. Uh
Going now to the committee you
represent
Loja.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Um I'm
sure you have a few
members on board. I'll try to be
as quick as possible.
Um, uh,
again, I'd like to give a little bit more
data when what I'm
looking at some of the information I'm getting
and I just wanted to,
um, say
something, uh, and talk about
the Fresh
Rx program that
we didn't fund this year
and it's unfortunate that we didn't,
but Mr Chair because of
that, it came to my attention and
I'd like to say, my mother who has type
two diabetes and
my brother who has type two
diabetes and
my family who,
um, generationally we
have, um, di,
uh,
that they suffer from diabetes. So
I'm on the list
by my, by my
genetic constructs to, you
know, to, um,
have diabetes myself.
And with a program like that and
my family's been able to use
that program, I
go now into my mom's
refrigerator and it's full of fresh
greens and, and
fruits. And I haven't
seen that since I was a child
to be quite honest.
Um, because
what, what is advertised
and I think this is brought up to and our
dietary, uh, plans
or what's available to
us as we get older
are really processed types
of foods. I think that
this is one of the most important programs.
And so when this came
to an issue and I found
out about the, this not
being funded, I felt first guilty
because I am on house
appropriations
and this got
by me. Um,
so I gave my junior
funding, um, to
this program and it's just a
band-aid to help.
And in fact, I, and I just
wanted to give, I'm meeting
with my cobb today
in Northern New Mexico to, to make sure
that goes through.
Um it's an important,
important program.
We have an estimated
um every year, an estimated
9008 hun
800 adults in New Mexico
are diagnosed with diabetes.
We all know that this is an
epidemic
and we really haven't,
we really haven't met
the need of what's going
on. And you mentioned other
uh diseases here.
I mean, the heart
heart disease and everything else
that can be attributed
to a, a poor diet. So
I think this is one of the most important programs
and I just wanted to say
thank you uh to
Denise for bringing this to my attention
and to be here to talk about
this and I will
be working uh to make
sure with other programs
uh that we're gonna get this funded,
but it's not just about the
funding, it's about what
we're gonna do to make sure that
we are creating.
Um we talked about
circular economies
yesterday, Mr, I mean, Mr
Chair, I think this is a part
of that, that cir
circular economy and what we have
to, how we have to build up
um this
uh our produce, our farming
and our and our egg. And
if we, we make those investments
and we're going to see the
effects on our health, the health
benefits to, to those
programs. Um
We don't always look at
the, the causation
of our, our issues,
but this is something
that we can solve.
We, we have
um We
have the constructs
in New Mexico to do this. We've been
doing this forever. This is part of
our culture and I
think we need to take it from
that, that position just as
mentioned from a. So
uh San Felipe
Pueblo here. Uh This
is these are our cultural
references of how we live our
life. These
diseases
are not part
of our history.
We've made them part of our history because
of the the types of
food that we ingest.
So more of me just
making a comment. Thank you to everybody
for all the work you're doing. I think we need
to invest in
the um the
cooling systems that we need to,
to keep our, our
foods available
to, to folks.
But unless we make these, these
true investments and these sorts of
programs don't go by the wayside
for us. We're going to keep
running into um
the health issues that
we have for our state. And
you know, we can, we
can, we can talk about all the
terrible things, Mr Mr
Chair about food. And
um but until we put
these, use these
programs to our advantage,
we're not gonna see better outcomes.
Thank
you.
>> Thank >> you, >> Representative Luhan
Center
Wood.
Thank you, Mr
Chair.
Thank you very much for coming
today guys. I appreciate
it. I
uh
I love it when producers
come, Mr Chair.
I'm I'm
impressed. I am
impressed
uh
Rice and Manny
uh
farming and
ranching
is a whole lot of
repairing.
You're not able to go out
and buy the newest and the
best equipment.
It's a constant
fixing.
I often say farming
is fixing.
It's, we got to know a whole
lot about,
about growing
things,
but you need to know
even more about fixing
things.
I'm pushing the, the,
the governor's ladies
went outside, but I'm
pushing a bill
called the right to
repair.
And
we have to be able
to,
to
repair this
machinery
in order to
survive.
We can't go to the
manufacturer every time
we need
something and, and this
machinery is getting
so much more
complicated
with all the
environmental
gadgets. It's got on it
to, to,
to
comply with the rules
we have today, not much
less
rules
of electrification
in the future,
but we, we, we
have to,
to have the ability
to work on that machinery
or at least have trained
mechanics
of our choosing
to work on that, that
don't have a
$300 an
hour
charge
at the equipment
dealer.
That's automatic when you
roll that tractor in
there.
So I'm begging
the committee to consider
that to pass that
and to pass that along to
the governor's office
that we need
that
very
capital
intens
occupation. I'll
never forget the first
time I went to a
banker
to borrow some money
for a
truckload of
steers.
That guy looked at me and
he said,
you may have just got out of
college, but you ain't
got no right to
ask for that kind of
money.
Many, I just
bought
50 heifers out
of Clovis.
450 at
$3.
That'll suck
you up a
little.
And I'll have to own those
heifers for a year before
I'm sold
and I have to keep them
alive for that year. And I
have to think about
earlier in the year I
bought AAA
load
of Mexican
steers
and you know, that load
of steers, I have to go through
the feedlot with them.
There ain't no other
market.
So
some of the rest of you guys may
not understand that is
why that is,
but
nobody wants to
take on that responsibility
of those cattle. So I
have to do it
myself.
The theory behind
what we're talking about
today
is closing the
gap between the
producer
and the
consumer.
Pretty simple.
How many places
are there in
between
that? Sometimes the
packaging costs as much
as the product.
Yesterday, we talked
about recycling
plastic.
It's hard to understand
that to the consumers
because they don't understand
what the processing
cost
and why
the farmer or the
rancher doesn't
get the biggest part of
that.
Several years ago.
Farm Bureau came
out with a, a
study
and a box of
Cheerios.
No, a box of Wheaties.
The farmer had four cents
in that
box.
The sports
figure
on the front of the box got a
dollar a
box.
Can you
imagine
who put in the most effort
for
that
who served
society in
that
farmers and ranchers
are sometimes
criticized for
many things. The,
the many
production tactics they
may have the, the,
the dis the, the
we are a society
that are so far
away from
the producer.
We
forget
the, the we we're
talk today about
the the risk
of floods, the risk
of droughts, the risk
of everything.
And yet
at the end, the
consumer wants
cheap, affordable
and beautiful
food,
beautiful.
If it's got a blemish on it, they
don't want it,
they want the
best.
Sorry Mr
Chair
DC.
Thank you,
sir.
>> Thank you, Senator Woods Representative
Armstrong. >> Thank
you, Mr Chairman. I'll be quick and to
the point, I appreciate
all your, all
your hard work and what you do for,
for New Mexico and for New Mexico
citizens. But I just
have to bring to point and
I wasn't gonna do it, but I'm gonna do it
anyway.
Um You know, the
barriers
for ranchers,
there's barriers for
farmers. So when
we talk about
implementing laws
and rules
that actually affect
ranchers and
farmers
negatively,
then all these beautiful
handouts that we
received
go by the wayside, opening
our food co ops, go by the
wayside.
And uh
you know, one of the
barriers
is the reintroduction of
the Mexican Gray
Wolf.
It's gonna be across the state of
New Mexico, whether you like
it or don't like it, whether
you approve
of it or disapprove of
it. But
in Kathryn counties since it was
brought up about, you
know, the, the distribution
of food,
we have a major issue
in Catron County with the
wolves killing
livestock and that is the
livelihood of the majority of
people and what they do
in Catron County,
that logging,
which there's a
whole another barrier there.
But please
keep in mind when we're voting
on policies,
think of the
effect
negatively or
positively on the other
things that we're trying to
do for New
Mexico.
We can't have
both.
We have to think of
what it does
for New Mexicans trying to
make a living here in New
Mexico and
for us trying to feed New
Mexico.
So I just wanted to bring that
to people's attention. Thank you, Mr
Chairman.
>> Thank you, Representative Armstrong.
Um So
members of the panel, I, I
recently heard a presentation
from uh
Presbyterian Health Care
Services and it
was really interesting to me what
they were doing with the, their
new hospital facility
in Santa Fe.
Um not only are they
hosting a farmers'
market on that side of
town, but they actually
have a, a kitchen
as part of their facility
uh and teaching people
how to prepare
healthy food. And that,
that was um I
mean, your, your program
is um
you know, fresh prescription.
Um They're literally
doing that, that, that, that
healthy food is part of
health care.
Um whi which is
really interesting and
I, I was thinking about it during
your presentation,
you know, yesterday, we heard
a lot about um
climate and then
recycling
and the
waste that we
create.
A lot of it is just
uh convenience and
habit.
Um
And,
you know, obviously it's closely
tied to the food we
eat in more
ways than one. A lot of that waste is coming
from the food we eat.
But, you know, the food
we eat is
convenience and
habit and,
you know, your programs are working
to change those
habits
and it's really not.
Um I, I don't
think it's really
so
that much more difficult to eat.
Well, it's
just, there are too many of us
that aren't in the habit
of doing it.
So, II I appreciate
um everything
you're doing. Uh I, I everyone's
mention funding.
Um
I wish I could more directly help
you with the funding.
Um But we
have in the New
Mexico legislator, the
legislature
bifurcated our
budget and
policy processes.
Um And
so I, I think, you know,
that uh at this
point, if you want
funding, you
gotta go talk to a different
committee. Um,
but I think there are certainly people on this
committee um
that support that and
I see uh representative Lujan
counting members on
this committee who serve on both commit
committees. So
that's good news.
OK. So if there's, if there's not
anything else from the committee?
Um, I, I thank you for
being timely. We're actually gonna
take a five or 10 minute
break. Our last,
uh, panel starts at
1115.
Uh, so don't go
far and
I know there's no such thing as a five
minute break, but we're gonna do our
best. Um,
thank
you.
Thank you everyone. Um
Our final uh panel
of the day is
soils, farms
and agri agricultural
workforce
development.
Um
Who, who, who are
we missing from
the panel?
Is she not coming
today?
Ok.
Um So thank you,
everyone. Uh First up, we have
Katie
Goetz.
>> Thank you, chair, I'm
Katie Goetz. I'm with the New Mexico
Department of Agriculture.
I work more than anything on our
healthy soil program.
So I'll be uh speaking to the
slides that you have there in
front of you and on the screen.
Um Who's not here as my
co-lead Dean Bruce?
And that's because he's out at a
field event. He's promoting
soil health and our program
out in Eastern New Mexico.
Our shares of the program
are as follows. I handle
the communication side, the
outreach piece admin
straight of, I'm largely in the
office. Dean has the
fun part of the job. He's out in the
field. He's working with farmers and
ranchers. He's got his hands
in the dirt. So that's what he's up
to today. But we both share
a production, agriculture background.
I grew up on a ranch in Sierra
County. Uh Following many
generations of my family,
my job now uh provides me
the luxury of working under an air
conditioner very different from my
childhood. Uh
So happy to be here today and
to talk about our healthy soil
program, a tip of the hat
to you Senator Stefanik
for sponsoring the bill
back in 2019. That's when
the Healthy Soil Act was
enacted. And that's what
created in mda's Healthy
Soil program. The purpose
of which is to promote
and support farming and ranching
systems and other forms of
land management that
increase soil organic
matter, aggregate
stability, microbiology,
and water retention
to improve the health yield
and profitability of the soils
of the state. Three
really important clauses
tied there together in one
purpose. So as we're
implementing our program where we
have questions, we turn
back to that as our
Northern
star
Representative Luhan asked a good
question earlier, she
said, so what are the practices
that work? What are the
regenerative things we ought to be looking
to do on soil. Those are
embodied for us in our five
soil health principles.
So you can follow along with me left
to right on the screen there.
Uh represented I think pretty
well in those icons. So that
house keeping the soil
covered, you think about your own
home life, the people inside
the animals, inside
the furniture inside is not well
protected unless it's got a solid
roof. So same
situation with your soil,
you want it armored with
something living preferably
to protect everything beneath
that soil surface. That
might look like planting a cover
crop that might look like
leaving crop residues in the
field to decompose right? Where they
are in situ
soil health principle number two is
to minimize disturbance on
cropland and minimize
external inputs.
What does that mean
in a word to minimize
disturbance on cropland? That's
to minimize tillage?
So you see that represented with
that tractor and that downward facing
arrow but to
minimize farm inputs,
we're looking at
fertilizer, we're talking about
herbicide, we're talking about
pesticide
and those are where the real costs
are. So where
that principle can be implemented.
Soil health goes up,
ideally, costs will go down
in tandem over
time.
Soil health principle number three is
to maximize biodiversity.
And here what we're talking about is
plants. So growing
different kinds of plants and
increasing the diversity of a crop
rotation will help you. I
implement uh soil health
principle. Number three.
So health principle number four
is to maintain a living root.
So the greatest amount
of the calendar year you can keep
a live plant in the ground.
The better it is for the soil, all
those roots are feeding those good
sugars down into the
biology living beneath that
soil that we can't see. But for
a microscope in
turn, that microbiology is
feeding the plant, those plants
feed the animals. Everybody wins
with that principle as
with the other four
fifth and final one near and dear to
my heart. I suspect to you
representative Armstrong and to you
Senator Woods, the integration
of animals into land management.
So the healthy Soil act calls
out the beneficial impact
that grazing animals
that birds, that
beneficial insects, that
keystone species such as
earthworms, the beneficial
impacts that all those species
can have on the land
when integrated properly.
So that may look like grazing
those crop residues. Once those
are left behind after
harvest, uh we
have funded some projects as you'll hear
about just in just a moment.
Bale grazing is the at
the heart of those projects,
planting pollinator
habitat. Another good way to
integrate animal life
and achieve soil health
benefits.
Turning to the next page here,
I'll focus on the grants to improve
soil health. I added that
phrase to improve soil health. To let
you know these are grants, these are
dollars going to
on the ground work
a full 90% of
the funding we receive in any
year goes to these
grants. So a couple
of different parties can apply for these
grants primarily are eligible
entities. You'll hear from
one in just a moment when you hear
from uh Marcos Valdez
at Istria Riba Soil and Water
Conservation District.
Our eligible entities are those
local governmental
entities with proven
land management capacity to
support healthy soil. I
pull that straight out of the healthy
soil Act. Those
parties include Pueblo's
tribes and nations.
They include Aquis
land grants or
SWC DS as I
mentioned and
N MS U co-operative
Extension Service. So
you think about the breadth of those
parties? My goodness.
There's upwards of of
20 tribal governments
in the state, 600
to 700 A seia depending
on the, the reference there,
upwards of 20 land grants,
nearly 50 soil and water
conservation districts,
there's extension representation
in each of our counties. So we're talking
a lot of different parties
that could potentially apply for these
grants up to
$100,000 is what we
offer for these on the ground projects
that I'll speak to in just a
moment.
We also welcome applications
from individuals,
farmers ranchers, other
land managers that are actively
doing something on their
land and so they can
apply as an individual, they can
apply as a, a partnership,
a business, even a
nonprofit.
And uh what we require
of these applicants because
they're necessarily operating at
a smaller scale. We say you
have to go see USDA
first go get
conservation planning done
with the natural resources
conservation service. That's
your ticket into the door
with us. Next
step in order to have fiscal
access to our program
is they have to secure project
sponsorship from a
soil and water conservation
district or from their
tribal government. Only
those two parties
can convey the dollars that we
would convey to them to
ultimately hit those
individually managed
lands. So
some popular practices, you've heard me
touch on these in an earlier
slide, planting cover
crops. Boy, do we see a lot
of applications uh requesting
cover crop seed. We will
fund those uh
provided that they point back to
what they learned from their conservation
planning with R CS.
We will not fund cash
crop purchases. So
people have asked us before, can
you help me with my apple
orchard? We cannot help you
establish it. We can help you improve
the soil but be
between those rows, but we cannot
help you establish that.
So planting cover crops, a popular
project type with us
applying compost, applying
mulch, applying biochar,
a new phrase for me when I started
working on this program,
that's a popular component of these
projects
in terms of livestock, installing
additional fence and drinkers to
facilitate rotational
grazing. And
you heard me mention bale grazing to
restore grass on bare
ground. So you think
about it the worst thing a rancher
wants to see is bare
ground. Those temperatures
get hot, they scare
off rain clouds. We don't want bare
ground. And that's probably
the greatest problem. Would you say
that ranchers face and
that pertains to their
soil? So, what a
bale grazing project can do
is to encourage that
biology. If you throw some
native grass seed between uh
beneath the bale,
bring out your livestock to graze
it down, leave behind a
certain percentage of residue
as established by Nr CS.
Uh spec uh specs,
then what happens once those
livestock are removed is that
nature can,
can, can return basically
so good old poop and stomp
action return that
uh that uh ground
cover to that bare
ground.
So when things happen pretty
soon, we're, we're gearing up
to do some really intensive
outreach, encouraging
people to get in the pipeline, go
see your local Nr CS
office, get your conservation
planning done so that
when it comes 2025
and we ring the dinner bell and say
come make application for
N MD A's Healthy Soil
program. They've already got
their paperwork done. They've been
mulling over their
project components in
their head. So
applicants apply early in the
calendar year and
then we work uh
in the middle months
of, of the year to
sort through paperwork to make
awards and grantees
will start implement, implementing
their projects in August,
they'll conclude next May. So
these are Tenmon
projects
where projects can happen
anywhere in New Mexico. So
long as the land is
managed
and we don't care if you pitch
us a project in terms of acres
or square feet. We consider
it all and just put a pencil
to it and make sure that uh the
dollars requested per acre
per or per square
foot are
sensible.
Skipping to the next page.
And, and what I'm touching on here with the grants,
the soil assessment and education,
I'll be talking about our eligible
entity capacity building.
These are all buckets of
uh spelled out within the
healthy soil act into which we
can uh in which
we can spend uh program
dollars.
So under the broad banner of
soil assessment and education,
something that we require of
each of our grantees is that they
both test and assess
their soil at the start of their
project, meaning
they're gonna go pull samples from their
project site, send them
off to the lab of their choosing.
We will pay for that sample
to be tested so that we have a
good chemical understanding
of that soil's properties.
The assessment piece is probably
the best part because
that's where the land manager is actually
putting their hands into the dirt
and understanding the soil
beneath their feet. What's
going on down there? Getting really
intimately familiar with
their own soil. We
then asked them at the end of their grant
to again assess the
soil. Again, establishing
that good behavior of really
intimately engaging with
uh your your most precious
natural
resource.
Shifting to the education side
of this slide, we sent out a weekly
newsletter and I'll pass
around a sign up sheet. If we run
out of spaces, you can uh simply
flip it over. So,
excuse me for just a
moment.
So with our weekly newsletter,
we uh
feature soil health
news, soil health events
as well as program updates and
deadline reminders.
Anyone, everyone is welcome
to subscribe to that. The
goal for us is to meet the
educational mandate that's
baked into the healthy Soil
Act to educate uh
not just farmers and ranchers
but also the general public, including
students. So that's the
purpose of that weekly newsletter
and that's the sign up sheet that will be
traveling around the table
momentarily.
This also speaks to our
educational efforts, our
promotion and outreach efforts.
So I believe uh staffers have
provided you a copy of a newspaper
insert that N MD A
distributed across the state.
In May of 2023
we printed a whole lot more
copies so that as we attend
events, we can provide this
to people to give them just a general
introduction to. What is
this notion
of soil health? And you'll see
that we featured a tribal
voice there and a seia voice
there, a soil and water conservation
district voice there as
well as our partners at New Mexico
Farm Bureau on the
back.
Importantly, that last
bullet, we invite you to come
join us next week.
July 31st,
August 1st, right here in
Albuquerque. We'll be
gathering at Embassy Suites
for 1.5 day
event. The first
day is sort
of like this very setting here.
We'll hear from a few academics.
But importantly, we will hear
from a farmer, a rancher
and from pra past healthy
soil program grantees.
So we will hear from Tom Sidwell,
a farmer out near uh excuse me, a
rancher out near Tucumcari
who has uh implemented
uh some of these practices. He,
he calls, he refers to them as
holistic practices. He's been
doing it for 40 years,
seen great gains in
his forages on his
ranch out near Tucumcari.
He'll be speaking to the group.
We'll also be featuring Colle
Viramontes who's a farmer
down near Deming young
person uh up and
coming working on a
multitude of specialty
crops and commodities
and uh regenerating
his soil through regenerative
practices. So we sure hope
you will join us. It is free
and we will be touring uh
some cropland down in Valencia
County as well as some rangeland
out at Pueblo
Sandia.
Next slide refers to the capacity
building for those eligible entities.
So if you think back to that definition,
those are our pueblos, our
tribes, our nations, our
land grants, our seia, our
soil and water conservation
districts. N MS
U's ex Extension
Service, lots of
eligible entities there. How
do we raise their capacity?
That's what Dean is up to today, my
co-lead. So as I said,
he's out presenting information
about soil health and in
information about the healthy soil
program, he's at a field
day and increasingly
throughout the year, he'll be making
in-person visits to those
various eligible entities
upon request or as
needed uh to
basically assist them with technical
assistance related to soil health
implementation. And
and our program in
particular, that
picture is actually of Dean. That
picture it left and
what he had just removed
his hands from there is it's called a
Penne tretter. So what Dean is
testing there is the compaction
of the soil.
So we've got some equipment that we
are working to get
distributed to those various eligible
entities. And in
turn, their objective
is to work with those local land
managers to use that equipment
and all ships will rise
as a result of us working with
those eligible
entities.
The final substantive page I have
to present on refers to
the research bucket uh in
which we put healthy soil
program dollars. A
couple of projects. I want to point your
attention to. There are four illustrated
here.
The one at the bottom
left Lydecker
Plant Research Science
Center. The question
being uh
asked with that research is
what are the best practices
for avoiding the negative
soil health impacts
when land is temporarily
fallowed to conserve
water? So
you'll see that we're in partnership with
New Mexico Interstate Steam
Interstate Stream Commission
on that question, their
interest, of course, to protect
that precious groundwater.
Our interest is in the course
of protecting that groundwater.
How do you stabilize the
soil? We don't want
noxious weeds to move in. We don't want
that soil to blow away.
So two agencies working
together to help resolve
that all important
question.
Another question, I'll point
you to that. We are funding uh
research uh
toward uh is
in the upper right hand corner, Clovis
Agricultural Science Center.
And as you hear me talking about the
entities uh doing this
research, conducting this research,
it might occur to you. These are New Mexico
State University Agricultural
Science Centers. So
very good partners
for us in terms of the soil
health research piece of our
program, the
question they're investigating
there, how can cover
crops and other soil health
practices benefit
farmers transitioning from
irrigated to dryland
production systems.
So you can see that what the questions
are here are very practical
and uh a couple
of them relate back to
water.
And with my fifth and final slide,
I'll invite you to be in touch with
us at our email address
there. Multiple people put
eyes on that email address
in a given day. Uh
So if you have a technical question
about our program, a financial
question about our program,
how do I apply for a
grant? That's exactly
where to reach out to us there at that
uh phone number that follows.
I mentioned to you that we have
a weekly newsletter. So if
that sign up sheet doesn't
make it to folks in uh behind
me, you can certainly
visit that website and subscribe
yourself.
Importantly, there is a GIS
map on our home page
there on that website that
shows the projects that we have
funded over the years and
it's current through Fy 23.
Soon to be updated with Fy
24 as we're still in the process
of closing up books and
dealing with all the attendant
chores with
that.
And I thank you for your time and your interest
in our program.
>> Thank you very much. Uh Next
up, we have Marcos
Valdez.
>> Thank you. Good morning. Mr Chair and
members of the committee.
My name is Marcos
Valdez. I'm uh
the district manager for
Easter Ariba Salt Water Conservation
District. Um
I also um
lifetime resident of
Northern in Northern New Mexico, a small
community called
Paka. Um
I'm also a mayor,
Lomo and my two local Ase
and, and a ditch commissioner and a
third one. So I serve
several capacities there.
I've been with the saltwater district
for a little over
13 years now.
Um Different
capacities I start off as
a, a service provider
and I'm fortunate enough to
be the, the district manager at the
district and I
serve at the,
as a
state uh um
president of the Employees
Association for
New Mexico Conservation
Districts.
Uh As you can see in my cover there,
uh Easter Arriba, uh we
cover the eastern part of Riaa
County. Um
We cover approximately
1.3 million acres.
So uh huge
diversity of farmers and ranchers
in our area uh along
with uh pueblos and, and
within the city and, and
such
for the soil and water conservation
district. Our mission is
to focus on the needs of soil
and water and other natural
resource conservation
for the use of future
generations and
to assist local landowners with
technical financial and educational
resources to make
improvements to their
land.
You got a
little
slide here showing the funding
sources that a typical sw
water district um
uses. Um
Unfortunately, not every
Swen water district has a mill
levy, but for the most
part, uh local mill
levies can fund sw and
water conservation districts
and it can kind of provide a
base funding to run a few
programs and possibly
um pay for
employees. And my
specific so water district,
we're operating with just three full-time
employees
we manage, we've
managed up to a $2 million
budget to cover
these kind of conservation
practices.
And that's thanks to a lot
of the grant funding on the right.
You see all the grants that we apply
for to help
offset some of the mill levy
dollars that we have within our
district. We run
pro programs such as the Youth
Conservation Corps. Of
course, N MD A with the Healthy
Soils program,
Theone Water Conservation Commission,
Water Trust Board,
the Land of Enchantment Legacy
Fund, which thank you all for
that. That's we, we just got
award some funding for capacity
on that one. The
regional Conservation Partnership
program, it's a USDA
program through NR
CS, the Natural
Resources Conservation
Service. And of course,
New Mexico State forestry.
So it's just been very
proactive and, and
trying to find grants that
will help put those dollars on the
ground to help farmers
and
ranchers
some programs. Um
I'll, I'll kind of for
the, for the matter of time
we have, we'll kind of go through them fairly
quickly. Um
But the first one I'm gonna talk about is
the Seia C share program.
We have started this program
since back in 2010
and as have assisted
321 landowners
within our district reimbursing,
reimbursing up to about
$745,000.
And this is to help promote
um irrigation efficiency
on the irrigated lands
within our district. So
irrigation um head gates,
you know, structure for water control
and piping and
such.
The next one program is
the uh noxious weed
program. So we have a
co-operative weed management
area. We um
we work with other small water
districts within,
within our,
our
region up there in Rubba
County. And it's of
course to help um
contain and control the spread
of noxious of invasive
weeds throughout our county.
Um We provide a lot of
early detection
education
and use of best
management practices for restoration
of these lands. Uh Since
2014, we
treated approximately 3000
acres within
our
area.
Next program is the farm rental
equipment program. Um
This is a great program. It, it
helps um, farmers and
renters directly
with the, the use of these
uh farm
equipment
opportunities that we have.
Um, the big top I uh
items are the,
the no till drill, of course, to
kind of implement and, and
complement the healthy
soils program
and of course, other
several items that
we have listed there. Um I
won't go through them all. I
just wanted to, to I
have appreciation for
Senator Pat Woods and,
and the comment he said earlier
about being able to fix things yourself
because at the so and water district,
we fix our own equipment. I personally
manage all that equipment
there's and, and keep
it in running
order.
Next slide is we
really promote youth
conservation. Uh
We're running on our eighth
year of, of
obtaining funding to hire
local youth and
we are currently mapping
out LA Seia
within Uh Rio Riba
County. We have
also have been working
with New Mexico Land Grant Council
to identify
legal dump sites within
those areas to see if we could get
funding to get them cleaned
up. 2024
grant, we were allocated
$62,000 to
hire um seven
individuals
to work with us for the
summer.
Next slide shows a quick uh
overview of all
the Asias that have
um directly been
inventoried and surveyed by
these youth that
we have hired over the years.
Uh They cover a lot of ground.
Um It's just
uh it's a good, a good
way to engage the youth
into the
importance of our ASE within
our
district.
The next slide covers a
little bit more of a federal
and state uh match
combination here.
Uh Regional conservation partnership
program is a federal program
funded through USDA and R
CS. And of
course, our match for this was
a New Mexico Water Trust
Board. Um We
ran this program from
2019 and just finished it
up earlier this spring.
Uh We, we were funded
uh $2.25
million to implement
on the ground conservation practices
on forest range
and irrigated lands
um across a
large region stretching all
the way into southern Colorado.
Of course, with the State
Water Trust Board plans, we focus
that on no, in
northern New Mexico,
a couple of items there of, of
course, forest and
improvement conservation easements,
pro management
irrigation practices,
riparian buffers, great
state structures,
cross fencing and water development
for livestock and
wildlife. And
we are fortunate enough to get some
funding this coming year in
the amount of
500,000
next slide shows
are uh
activity with healthy
soils. Uh We
obtain funding for the healthy soil
program. We do sponsor
individuals as Katie
mentioned earlier. Um
but we also uh
apply as a
eligible entity as
well and we try to
help uh producers
with a co uh cost
reimbursement for cover crop
seed. So as you can see in the
photos, um
those are actual
on the ground projects that
were completed with that program.
Um to really go
ahead and see that soil coverage is just
amazing. Um
It's a great program.
We also have a in-house
fund where we fund
promote landowners to
test their
soil
emergency funding. As uh
as representative I
mentioned earlier, uh we
did experience
a traumatic flood
that came through our
area um June
20th. So to
try to be pro proactive in
a situation like this, we
applied for um
us DNNR CS
funding. It's called the
Emergency Watershed Protection
Program. It does require
a 10 to 25%
match, of
course. Um And speaking with,
with Representative Guerrera, we,
we were able to
get a, a, an application
in for the New Mexico Match Fund
and that's where it's ideal,
that's where it works. Uh It
was very quick.
Um I really appreciate that
because
um I think it
came in about a week after I
applied and it's contingent
on the funding from the
federal side. So
now I'm just waiting for, for federal
approval and we could get
some assistance out to those landowners
that really need it due
to that catastrophic
flow.
Lastly, I just want to touch
on some challenges.
Um Like most of
SWC D's capacity is
a big issue uh due
to our limited staff,
um administrative support
on grant funding is crucial
and that's where we need help
uh to try to get some
admin dollars
to pay off some of those
costs, asso
associated
issues such as a
higher tiered audit,
a lot of districts
experience that and they need,
they need that capacity. So
any any kind of assistance they can
get there with more admin
more capacity,
duration of
contracts,
uh short time frame
to execute programs. Maybe
we can consider
looking at a, at a twoyear
program, something similar to like
the, the, the New Mexico
Water Trust Board Fund. I
think that gives us ample
time to go ahead and complete those
tasks,
fiscal year demand.
Uh We all operate off the same
fiscal year. So there's
a lot of funding cycles that
are starting and ending at the same
time. So that can get a little
bit chaotic for a
for a small entity.
Um SWC DS are
unique special districts
and
if we somehow could
bring light to the fact that
they need specific attention
when we're dealing with Department
of Finance, finance Administration
and audit compliance.
They kind of tailor everything to
state agencies. They
kind of leave us out and
there's a lot of gray areas where they could
provide us more
support
opportunities. The 2.5
million allocation to
SWC DS
will increase the or increase
base funding from 20,000 to
$70,000. That, that's
huge. That's a big help
to local and water districts
that will provide that
capacity to a lot of these
districts. However,
if there's any way we could do that
a little bit more reoccurring
or just to kind of really
get these districts to keep going.
It would be really grateful.
And the new Mexico Match Fund, as
I mentioned earlier is instrumental
when applying for federal funds.
So, um just thank you
all for, for all your support.
Thank you for supporting your local
swim and water conservation districts.
Um We, we definitely
can make some, some impact
on the ground. We just need, need
some assistance. >> Thank
you.
Thank you very much. Um
Next up, we have James
Skeet.
No, you got turn
on.
How's that? That's
better. >> All
right, tasting, tasting. We're
getting
hungry.
Yeah, I don't
know if you've got the sheet here.
Um
You can go
the next slide here.
Um We thought it'd be
good to just kind of put some
barriers down for
yourselves as
we look at um
my wife is over here,
Joyce. We're
kind of in the middle of being crash
dummies. We've
added the name indigenous
crash dummies
because we've killed animals.
We've killed plants in the
process of trying to get to where
we're going. And
there's a lot of barriers that
um have been in our
way. One of them is
climate. We
work on a farm that doesn't
have
water,
meaning it doesn't have a, well,
we capture everything from,
from our rooftops
and then we work with the soil
to make sure that we have
the highest level
of uh
sequestration going
on. And that's really
looking at the fungal, the the
bacteria ratios,
things like that. Um
And in this process uh
of climate
uh mitigation or
climate change or whatever
you might call it. There's an opportunity
for farms like ours
um to
look at things in a
different lens. Uh We've
been looking at lenses through
conventional farming,
tilling, plowing
a lot of things that I think has
been detrimental
to our environment.
Um And it's really a high
level uh
inputs uh instead
of looking at the process,
the process, meaning looking
at uh the
biology,
I coined the term
bio cosmology
to incorporate
life and and the
idea of indigenous
cosmology.
And then we also coined the
term if you look at the
other page.
Um Indigenous
regenerative
intelligence,
indigenous using
local materials,
regenerative, we
know that our soils are
depleted and they're in,
in dire straits.
Um especially
in our area.
We work in a very brittle
environment. The
the the biros is very
thin. Uh
everything that we do, we
have to calculate, we have
to really make sure
that we're watching
everything. Uh The the
time that the the cattle
is on there, the time that the
sheep are on there,
you know what we plant in the
soil really has to
have a very
uh intelligent perspective.
So, regenerative to
us is just starting
from zero. We know that the
land has been
uh really
gotten to AAA
depletion point.
Give you an example
50 years ago, my
grandfather whose name used
to be money skeet
because he hang around the trading
post and then trading
poorman missionary would
say, what do you want? And he was
five years old, he'd say
money.
So that's how he got, got his
name. But he was a very
entrepreneurial
kind of person headman
there in our community,
which is called Vander wagon.
Um But that's even,
uh, not getting down to the
core of really
the, the name of the place.
Uh, the name of the place is to
watch it, which means where
you, where you dig for water.
But, uh, long story
short, he started plowing,
um, the area that
we now live in,
um, and the area we now
live in, uh, he plowed for
five years. He was able to
produce beans, corns
and squash. Three sisters.
There's also another fourth
sister, the Amri.
We don't talk about that.
Um But he did
that and 6070
plus years later,
the soil is still in
bad shape. We got
um sage growing in
there, bare
soil very
compacted. Uh
So coming back
in 10 years ago, working for
managed care, uh
being the tribal
liaison for
unitedhealthcare,
we decided to
quit the
corporation work
because they couldn't
really
understand
what it means to for,
for food to be medicine.
Instead were given more
synthetic drugs and all that.
So I really was uh
pushing back on
the whole system of
health care across
the US
and they, they, they couldn't
get it. So instead of
my wife and I talking and,
and complaining about
it, we decided to
looking into
soil science. And
one of the first person that we
met in that process
was Elaine Ingham. Of
course, we met Doctor
Johnson and uh Christina
Jones and some other, some
other Australians that
are doing a lot of soil
work. So
my wife is from a Pennsylvania
Dutch. She's a Mennonite
Amish background
for her. It was
easy to grow things,
but she couldn't do it out
in our area.
Uh the climate, uh
the soil, uh
There's a lot of factors that were
involved in being barriers
to us. And
uh so these barriers are things
that we have learned in that
whole process of
entering into that
space.
I told my wife, I said, we're
gonna go into this land
and we know that
it's, it's
got zero really
capacity for growing
anything.
Nothing really.
Um And
I said, I want to walk away
when I die, I want to walk
away
having that soil in better
shape, uh
better condition, better,
better, better things that are
happening within the soil.
Can you do the next
slide?
So that soil, the
handful of that soil, uh
it's got the population
density of what
the globe is.
And if you smell good
soil, that's
got um
biochar in
there. And I'll talk
a little bit more about the biochar
that in itself will
hit every endorphin if you
smell it. Uh So
you can get off alcoholism,
drugs, crack whatever,
but I don't, I
don't know what she's on, but
uh she's smelling the
soil.
And uh there's some things
that are happening for some
reason, human
beings are,
are the ones no
other animal has
this attraction and
attachment to soil,
the smell of soil
as soon as it rains.
What do we do? Turn
on the vent and just
smell that soil. It's
that sort of
innate thing that we have
with the connection with
soil. Next slide,
please. So
this is a picture that um
Wayne Belson, a soil
scientist and I worked on some
things on trying to make
compost in five
gallon buckets
and he was able to do
that. So
what we have is a persistent
haze which the
nuclei of that
is dust
and dust in, in
that exchange
of positive and negative
charges will detract
hydrogen molecules.
The greenhouse effect
starts and what we have
is a lot of runoff
compaction, bare
soil and it
heats up
and in that heating
up uh rainfall
uh when it comes, it
seems to go around those
desertified lands.
You see it in Tuba
City Caya
Gallup and some of the places
there, it just kind of moves
around. Now, if you
look at the right hand
side of it, the biotic
pump,
what I'm learning now is
there's not only a pump in the
atmosphere but there's a
pump down in
the soil. The
microbial pump
working with
fungi and bacteria.
And what it does is that
we're gonna be talking
about uh
carbon,
liquid carbon. Now that
what plants do is
create liquid carbon.
It, it exudes it
out into the, into the
roots and
exudates and the fungi
work and also
the uh the the bacteria
work together. And so it creates
this pump. So what
happens is as it
releases from the soil
carbon, there's a release
of bacteria into the atmosphere
and that's the right nuclei
for those hydrogen molecules
to be attracted to.
It's amazing what you can
do with
good microbial
sponge on the soil.
So that's one of the reasons.
And the other thing that we're learning
too is that seeds are
getting dumbed down by
synthetic fertilizers,
pesticides and herbicides.
So the seeds that we're not,
we're now getting
is deficient of nutrient
density as well as
the food. So,
what we're doing in conventional
farming is we're dumbing
down the seeds.
Uh And that's why it's
so important to go to the
indigenous communities
and get some of those seeds
that they have in there.
Um The other thing too
that, that we're learning too is
this uh concept
that, um
you have to have working
roots in the soil,
you have to have roots
that are working.
It doesn't matter what, what,
what kind of plants they are,
you know, like uh cover
crops. It could be
annual crops. It could be pre
annuals.
Uh
the uh pre annual crops
which II I know there's another word
for it but the, the,
what I call, what you all
call weeds are
medicine plants. To us,
it it's more nutrient
dense than annual annual
beans. Corn, squash doesn't have
the nutrient density.
So what
were indigenous people
doing? Uh
1491
and back,
how did they
have the the level
of load capacity, the
population density
uh in this western
hemisphere?
And I feel
it was because of biochar,
what they were doing in the
Amazon and they're still excavating
some of those uh uh composting
areas and it keeps
growing, the compost
keeps growing. The half-life
of biochar is
1000 years.
So if we're gonna talk about
seventh generation down,
why not me? Uh
mitigate the the
soil to be able to
function
seven generations
down? And this is what
they did. The reason why we
don't hear too much about biochar
on the land. The burnings
and things that happened
is because
after 1491
into 1492
those microbial pandemic
bugs began
to proliferate uh through
the indigenous communities that
annihilated them.
Can I can
just cannot
imagine
what took place there.
So when settlers came
in, they saw this
pristine romantic
land when it
was devoid of indigenous
populations, the Incas
the Mayans, the, the
southern tribes, the,
the, the, the Tahana
Aham, the PMA, the, the the
the Maricopa
were annihilated. So
a lot of that indigenous
knowledge was lost
in that whole process.
So what, what am I saying?
We need to look
at different
lenses on how we look at
agriculture, different
lenses on how we
look at uh capitalism
and, and colonization,
different lenses on
how we do work
on our soil.
And so that's one of the things that
we've been doing. We're just
a small outfit, we don't have
any water. So everything
that we do is is we
look at the context in which
the soil is that and then begin
there and start rebuilding.
Uh The other thing that I
wanted to mention is
that
seeds,
uh the actual word,
if you break it down means the
seed of governance
where decisions are
made.
Wow.
Put that in your
legislation box, you
know, see
that's where a lot of governance
takes place.
And that microbiome
in the seed
is it
gets attached with the
soil and it, it,
it grows.
So the seeds actually
carry the DNA, the
microbiome in the soI
in the soil and then that's how it
grows. So when you have a lot
of roots growing the
diversity in the soil,
not mono,
mono
only allows
certain microbes to
function in that soil.
So what you need is a lot of
diversity in your
soil. Yep.
All right, I'll stop.
I'll stop.
Yeah, thank
you.
>> OK.
OK. Thank you very
much. Um
uh I think uh
Sarah's encouraging you just to
wrap up if you want
to
tied together
or do you just want
to stop? >> Um Yeah.
II I do think that
uh the things
that uh let me, let me just read,
use heat
from our, our biochar
machine to warm the greenhouse. That's
what we're doing with Texas.
Another thing is we design
composting dosing pumps
that will neutralize chlorine
and chloride water from
urban areas. That's what's killing
a lot of our plants in the city,
city growers, uh
fermenting animal
feed to get it
probiotic available.
Uh And some of these
are just slides that, that
show you a little bit of what, what's
important in the soil,
nomadic grazing we
reins re
establishing.
See, this is the biochar
where all the, all the
microbes can go in there and,
and a lot of these fungi
and bacteria run on
these charges called cds,
which are positive charges
and they build that house, those are
apartment buildings. And so
when you charge it up and get it
into your soil,
it really brings
the nutrient density for
your plants there.
Um and then
feed bio feeding
biochar to animals
to increase microbes in the grazing
soil, compost
health of animals and meats.
Uh If you can find
the Indian guy in there. You win a
prize. So these
are some foraging that we do
around our area
so you can reach us
there if you want more
information. And
guess what?
I hate to say this to you
all. New Mexicans
is that we're getting more
tractions in
Utah,
uh Washington
and other states in
regards to soil of
the, some of the things that we're doing
on that farm, that little
farm. So
I, I think we all need to get on
board to really start sequestering
water in the soil
as well as
redesigning what we
mean by agriculture
that it has to have the
ethics to move forward
right now. We just, we just have
the ethics of production
and
extraction, so
I'll stop there.
>> Thank you very much.
Um Next up, we
have not, Sarah Wentzel
Fitzer.
>> Hi, my name is Zach Withers
and Sarah Wenzel Fisher fell
ill. So she asked me to
deliver her remarks in her
stead. Uh We've been a long
time partner of the coalition.
Uh I run a farm in the East
Mountains near San Antonito called
pk's Olley Farm. We
do small scale livestock
production. We
divert about somewhere around a
million pounds of food waste a year
to feed animals, produce
compost.
Um And
then we run a small butcher
shop farm stand about six
miles from the farm in Cedarcrest.
So I'm gonna
try to focus on
Sarah's remarks here
and do it in a little bit of an abbreviated
fashion because one of the other
uh we delivered the pork
yesterday for lunch and I'm pretty
excited about that. So I don't want to keep us
from that. Um
Wanted to echo some of the
sentiments about the New Mexico
Healthy Soils program that's been a
real game changer.
Um And
tagging off of
um
James's
previous comment, like the importance
of connecting agriculture
to ecosystem
management and thinking
about the way we produce food as
a way to actually
heal water cycles, build
soil health. Um
you know, protect our natural
resources and in
ways that sustain our
communities. Um The
New Mexico Legacy Fund has
made a huge impact and
I hope we can continue
getting permanent funding
to increase
investment in those sorts of
programs. Um
Little side note, I think
there's rumors about loosening the
anti donation
clause. Uh We think
that would be really helpful for
getting more
resources to
producers
um and reducing
some of the bureaucratic
barriers there.
Um Another
thing that we really
support and want to ask you to
continue to support is the ag
workforce development
program. We have
very, very old
demographics in
agriculture in New Mexico
and getting young people into the game
is hard. It's um
I can say personally, like
labor is expensive
and you want people
that you need to pay,
you don't want people that will work
for really cheap. Uh
taking care of your
equipment and your animals and stuff.
So I'm really excited. We're gonna
be applying for our
uh for
that grant program to help
staff our farm
soon and that program
is, is really
powerful. Another
program I'd like to highlight is
the star
program, which is the,
let me get back on my
notes
here.
Uh The
saving tomorrow's agricultural
resources program.
This is a cool program that
is empowers farmers
and ranchers to choose conservation
as the standard on all agricultural
lands to ensure a legacy of
clean, abundant water and healthy
soils for future generations.
Uh designed and led by
producers. The start tool
utilizes science and experience
to target local solutions for
local natural resource concerns
and support farmers and ranchers
on their conservation journey
wherever they are. Uh It's
a cool tool that helps
shift culture around the way
that we do agriculture. If
you're in a,
you know, traditional agricultural
community, sometimes being worried
about the neighbors. Uh
thinking you're weird or
crazy. This is to help
highlight that these changes that
we need to be making in agriculture
are really positive.
Um
Another thing that's been brought up
quite a bit is the
importance of compost and
biochar. Um
One thing that the
coalition is currently
working on is a
climate spa commodities
grant program
um called
I believe it's called Supper
or Soil to Supper.
And this
is
um to support
ranchers to get more meat and other
livestock products into regional
supply chains while reducing
waste, increasing soil health
and building climate resilience.
Uh This project was inspired by
seeing the opportunities created through efforts
like the food farm and hunger in
initiative to create stronger
supply chains in the state
as well as an opportunity
in better waste management.
Recognizing that municipal waste
management as well as forest thinning
presents an opportunity to create useful
byproduct's compost biochar
for agricultural production.
Uh Caber has been conducting
trials with bale grazing compost
production on Rangeland for the last
three years. Both have demonstrated
the capacity to significantly increase
soil organic matter on Rangeland
with a single application
commend the legislature for its
investment in a small research
project related to developing compost
facilities in rural communities.
But we could be doing a lot more.
I encourage this committee to prioritize
compost and
bio biochar production at the
state and municipal
level.
Um
Another
barrier to
really getting a lot of these
things to take off is the
ability to access
local markets. I'd
like to reemphasize.
The state has adopted
recreated the state
meat inspection program.
Um
for people who are trying to do regenerative
grazing to rebuild
soil to improve watershed
health. They have
to sell at
a, at a sale barn. You
just don't get paid what you need
to get out of the
animals to be able to make that
economically feasible. And
the barrier to being able to
overcome that is that you have
to go through
inspected
processing facilities.
There are five in the
state. Um
The state meat inspection
program was authorized, was
authorized last year. It was
restarted
34 years
ago. Um And
they are still two years out
from being anywhere
functional. I talked to the new director
yesterday and he is
redoing all the work that the
previous director spent the last
two years doing.
Um This is a
problem. I have to drive to
Chama at three o'clock in the morning
tomorrow to get hogs to
a facility because
the local other local facility
just shut down. Um
So we could really use a lot
more intentional,
actual effort into
increasing uh
market access for local
meat producers.
Um
And I will end with talking
about that. None of these things
are happening in a
vacuum like we really need
community of practice around
this. We need to
be thinking about
these things, not just
agriculture as production
and extraction, but
agriculture, as
stewarding the land
and building
local economies.
Um And
we got to take long term approach
to it because nothing
we've been trying to
rehabilitate the soil on our
farm for nine years
now and it
is, it
takes a long time. So we
need programs that are going to
be adaptive over
time. And uh,
yeah, I think that's all I got. Thank you
guys.
Thank >> you very much, uh
Brandon
Devine,
uh Mr Chairman and
members of the committee. Uh
Let me begin first
by apologizing
that other people from my office
couldn't be here today and
you got saddled with me.
Um, uh
I was a teacher, agriculture
teacher for 25 years
in our public school systems. And
then I went to work now
with the State Department
of Agriculture Education
and the F office.
And I just wanted to
talk to you today about
uh the systems that we
use to educate
our uh students
in the public schools here in New
Mexico.
Um I
think it was yesterday. I heard
on the radio that the New
Mexico average high
school student graduation
rate is at
77%.
Whereas, uh New
Mexico students that are
involved in career and
technical organization,
their graduation rate is
at 96%
uh division of
career and technical education
that I'll speak to you today is
about agriculture
education.
Um There are 100 and
28 agriculture
teachers in over
95 middle
and or high schools
uh here in New
Mexico
and we're growing every day.
I just went and did a visit
uh
two days ago with a
new teacher at a new
program here in the
South Valley at Rio Grande High
School.
Um
The three circle model that you
see there is is
basically the components
that we use to
educate our students.
Um The first being
um
basically the
classroom and laboratory.
Uh the where they
receive their instruction
in that we use uh seven
different agricultural
career pathways,
agricultural business,
animal systems, environmental
systems, food
products and processing
natural resources,
plant systems
and power structure and
technical systems.
We recognize that there
are over 300 unique
careers in
agriculture and we're
trying to prepare the students
in these areas.
One of the major components
that we use
as we're trying to prepare
to develop a agricultural
workforce
um is what we
call supervised
agricultural
experience.
Uh To most of you, a
more familiar term
in this area would be that
of a project-based
or a work based learning
system.
Students in agriculture
education, develop
skills, time management
and recordkeeping systems
along with other
various areas in
agriculture
and the divisions of
entrepreneurship,
placement, paid or
unpaid research
and career exploration
and and employability
skills.
In 2023 New
Mexico Agriculture
education students
and their supervised
agricultural experiences
generated over
$1.2
million collectively in
New
Mexico.
The third component that
most of you are probably
more familiar with
is that of the career
and technical student organization
known as the FF,
formerly known as the future
Farmers of America.
Uh I think that
best served
developing our
agricultural workforce
uh goes with the FF
motto of learning
to do, doing to learn,
learning to live and living to
serve.
The uh mission
is best delivered through
uh competitive events
that we call career development
events. In
New Mexico. We have 39
different career
development events ranging
from agricultural
communications to
wool evaluation.
Um in
respect to the
panel up here about
soils. We have
um also career
development events in what
we call land evaluation,
home site evaluation,
pasture, and range
development,
um
forestry, uh
various areas that
we're training students in this
area. And I appreciate
the members of the panels and the
efforts that they're making in their
communities and
with the uh young
people as well in their
communities.
Um
I guess if I had
to say our most pressing
issue uh right now
here in New Mexico, we have
5000,
373
FF members
uh throughout the state.
Uh National FF
is pushing for us
to go to a
uh
uh
everyone is a member
if they're in agriculture
education. And
when that happens, our
membership size
is going to double.
Um we're gonna have over
10,000 students
probably more because we are adding
those programs
and with that, it's gonna come with
its own challenges of
serving these students
and, and getting
them to do
their activities, events,
uh, being
able to support the teachers,
which is my main
job responsibility.
Um, I, I
appreciate some of
the things I've heard here today
and I just wanted to
add a,
a, I
guess, put a bug in your ear.
Um,
one of the things
that I, I'm working towards
and, and I think that
legislatures could help
me is that a
lot of our funding that we
get in agriculture
education is
towards the, the shop
area which I appreciate that
from Mr, uh, representative
or Senator Woods
and, uh, everything.
But we are lacking
in funding to support
things such as greenhouses,
school farms
and um
with the new inspect Meat
Inspection Act,
um there's only four
schools here in New Mexico
that have meat processing
labs, they're old,
they're dilapidated and some
of them aren't even in use
anymore. And I think
that those are some things that
if we were able to put
that in some of our local system,
it might help us towards this
Meat Inspection Act that's coming
out. Um And
there again, the greenhouses and
the school farms
uh because we
try to focus on hands-on
learning and agriculture
education.
Um It,
it's, it's the better
way of doing it, learning to do and
doing to learn.
Uh And with that, I, I
appreciate your time.
Uh Mr Chairman and
members of the committee.
If uh
at any time there's other questions
you might have, you can reach out to
our office. Uh
Our information is on
New Mexico,
nmf.org.
Thank you.
>> Um Thank you to the panel
for your presentation uh
presentations. We do
have a few questions for
Sub Representative
Herrera.
>> Thank you, Mr chair.
I I wanna uh
let the panel
know that um,
my new favorite
superhero is
Marcos Valdez.
Um And I just
want to say when that flood
hit, I was trying to get a
number
on, you know, how
many little it is a pretty
small area, I mean,
large, but
compared to the fires
in Riodosa, a pretty small
area that went from
highway 84
down to the Chama River
between a BCU and
kind of the beginning of
Espanola. If you
kind of know those areas, that's
where the floodplain occurred.
And somebody said, called Marcos.
And I said, well, who's Marcos? And they
said he runs the soil and water
conservation district. And then
he told me, and I
never knew this.
Our soil and conservation
districts are the only
state agencies in our
state that can actually
help private
landowners. They can go
on to private land
and you know, bring
bulldozers and backhoes
and remove silts and
clear. I mean, we have
driveways that were flooded
and farms that were funded and they're
still not dried out.
But when we eventually
get this money and I want to
compliment Rebe
from the governor's office in D
FA. I never saw D
fa move in a day. I gotta
say it was a new
experience, but we had that
match fund. Thank you all very
much. They went in, we
got it cleared. So now we're
waiting on the federal money,
but it was Marcos who uh
alerted me to the
fact that he said,
I think we start with a million
and see if we can do it and then go
from there. So, I, I think
that's just an important thing for
most people to know
that are in the legislature.
I certainly didn't know.
And I, I
so appreciate all
your work and,
um, I would just
tell everybody, um,
if you have
$100,000 left
over at the end of your capital
outlay, you might, you might look
around and meet with a person who runs
your soil and water conservation
district. They do really
important work
and uh kind of the first
line of defense when a
when an emergency happens
involving land and
water and,
and um
I guess I do have a
question here. Is there any way
to get rid of Russian olives?
Have any, has anybody
solved that
problem?
>> You're gonna need
to use the >> mic.
You can, you can
biochar a lot of these invasive
species.
And uh you know, I
don't think we're doing enough
biochar system.
Uh the biomass that's all
around along the
bosque. They need
to really get some of that
into biochar. Biochar is a
very fixed
carbon, you
know, structure that you can put
back into the soil.
Why not? And we're,
we're looking at some of the same
stuff with the Salt Cer
in Arizona.
Um We're also
biochar sage in, in
our area because that's a very invasive
species So there's a
lot of things that you can do
to mitigate
and incorporate, you know, the
natural
systems.
>> Thank you. I guess, I guess
I will address that question also
to the soil and conservation
people. Are you funding that?
And is anybody doing that
successfully? I can't tell
you how often we take
out the,
you know, uh
the Russian olives
and the state pays for that.
We all do it and then
we're right on the Ambu River
and it comes back and
two years later, it's all back
again. >> Right,
Mr Chair and
representative
um at within our
district, we're, we're trying to promote
um um those efforts through
mastication and extraction.
Um The hard part,
yes, you hit the nail on the head.
There's we remove
it, but we got to make sure that the
landowner continues to
maintain that practice
to where they continue to do their
annual maintenance and
whether it's, it's mowing down
or pulling out
those sprouts
or to utilize herbicide
application to control them.
But right now, the
the efforts we're using is our
mastication
extraction.
>> Thank you. Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, Representative Senator
Woods.
>> Thank you Mr Chair. And
again, I
praise you, sir. I
praise you.
The,
you guys weren't here yesterday.
I was criticizing you.
So
I
uh
I uh I
want you to know
that, that
the agriculture
industry, the,
the farming,
the farming.
So
how farmers farm
has changed a
lot
and it's going to continue to
change
the, the,
when I started,
um, when I was a
kid, we, we drugged
those old one
ways around forever.
I don't know if any of, you know what
a one way is,
but it's a disk
that would leave the soil just
completely
clean
and
it made it very
vulnerable to
erosion.
And during
the fifties,
we saw a lot of that, that
happened.
Um,
we, we
learned from that
and, and
there was a gentleman in
Kansas that decided
he could take road
greater,
um,
blades and
make a plow out of those
blades. And he made a V
shaped,
plow, a V
shaped, uh,
uh, blade
that we used to
plow with. And
it left
the stubble,
the residue on top of the ground.
It didn't, it
didn't plowed into
the ground. And, and with that
Mr Chair that,
that cut down on that soil
erosion, but it also left
something to hold the
moisture
by having something
on top of the ground.
The worst
mistake that I have
to explain every
time I
hire someone,
we feed a lot of round
bales
and we feed those bales
and there's a lot of, a
lot of it that doesn't get eaten
or some of it that doesn't get eaten.
And it, if you keep feeding
the same spot, well,
that the piles up
and, and,
uh, you catch a snowstorm
and one of those
hands backs into one of
those areas,
you go get a tractor to pull
him out because
there's so much moisture that is
trapped under that.
And that's just an indication
of, of what
ground cover
does
is it traps
moisture,
same amount of moisture
fell there as it did
over here where
there's no, no
cover and
that trapped the moisture and
that evaporated the
moisture.
So the, but
there's,
there's,
you probably don't know this,
but I wasn't real
keen
on the,
the
soil
deal when I,
when I, when it came
across
and the reason I wasn't
because
for, I'll give you an example, Miss,
she and I know we're, we're busy, we
need to move on. I'll give
you an example.
I had AAA
gentleman
that farmed in
Iowa
in the Iowa State
Fair.
They take some soil that's
full of earthworms
and they put
leaves on top of
that. So that
far last 10 days
at the end of that 10 days,
there's no leaves on top of that
soil. Those earthworms
have drug it down in that.
So,
but the difference between
New Mexico
soil
and I was
saw,
it's probably about 20
to 25 inches of
rain.
What we can do as a
as you stated, what
we can do,
we're more limited in
a dryland
situation
with what we can do to raise
crops, to make it productive,
to raise crops.
There's been great
innovation
in farm machinery.
You showed me pictures
of eight and 10 ft
wide
drills
when I first tried to
do the no
till
I couldn't penetrate the
ground with what I had
to do.
Uh I had an old shake
drill, a crust. Buser
drill.
I broke those dang
shanks, just
pop, pop, pop,
pop and let me tell you,
Mr Chair, that was not
cheap.
I have
got some no till drills
now and
they're 40 ft wide.
I farmed 7000
acres.
It takes a little bit to get
across that kind of
country
and we
can plow and
we not plow, but we can
plant, you
know, 10,
8, well, five
and six miles an hour.
So you can cover a lot of
acres.
But all of this is a
changing
deal.
The seeds that we're planting
today
have been engineered
to increase yield. So it
was talk uh
Representative Lujan
talked about how many more
acres it will take to
feed
the people.
We are not
incentivizing the
American farmer
to the degree
that he increases
production.
Nobody in the room believes
that
food is too cheap
people,
the, the, the average
person doesn't want to go into
agriculture. The grandkids
don't want to go into agriculture
because I can make a hell of a lot
more than working for Lockheed
Martin in Denver,
Colorado.
Then I can working on that damn
for
the farmer
is going to be the guy
that has the money
on the last
day because
he's going to feed the
people.
He's going to know how to feed the
people. He's gonna take his
experiences.
And as far as
the F FA and
FFA
teachers,
you're taking some rough
old kids
and I can name a bunch of
them and
making FFA teachers
out of them.
The, the
Max Gary's and
the Storm Gerhart
and the Jerry
Franklin's and
the, oh my
gosh, the pedigree
and oh my gosh,
those guys was rough
as a cop,
but you was able to train
them
and they was able to
train their
students.
They took them
their criminals
and made good people out of
them.
No,
uh giving them a, a
purpose in
life, a
purpose. There's
something about digging in that
soil and
smelling. There ain't no
doubt
anybody that smelled good
soil knows what good smells,
smells like
and,
and,
and, and the other part
of it, Mr
Chair,
many of these fairs
where these animals take
in and we show
these
animals,
it's about raising kids,
It's not about raising
animals.
There's, there's a saying
that the,
the outside of a
horse is good
for the inside of a
man.
Those animals,
the responsibility of
raising those animals is
so important
to make good character of
people.
Many times, we, we
wonder why we, we
lose these kids and
that those are the
exact reason the,
the, the, the
one on one
of the ag teacher
with the student,
one on one with that.
I'm, I'm,
I'm done. I'm
done. Thank
you, Mr Chair.
>> Thank you, Senator Woods.
Uh response to your
comment yesterday that you want different
points of view on the panels.
I was thinking maybe we should have invited
a real estate
developer,
>> Mr Chair.
I agree with you and we
should invite
the uh uh
the uh
uh the
people that wanna turn our
agriculture land
into uh
bird sanctuaries
too. We
should bring those people in
and, and have that discussion
on um
where we are
on, on
raising food, feeding the
world. So I agree
with you if you want to do
that. >> Thank you, Senator
Woods, Representative
Armstrong.
>> Oh man, I got to
follow Senator Woods again. I
gotta get on the list
quicker.
So, you know, ultimately
Mr Chair, it's, it's a way of
life.
It's we raise,
I raised my Children
in a certain way of
life,
ranching,
farming,
uh
giving back
different things. So it's, it's about
a way of life and how we
choose to,
to uh foresee
our life and our children's lives
in the future.
So
starting with Marco
recurring funding
for soil and water conservation
districts, we,
we got some funding in the in
the house Bill two last year. We're
looking to put more
personally, I'm looking to put
more and make it
recurring
because of the exact
situation that you talked about.
And so having
them to, to be able to have
the capacity to,
to do the things in their districts.
So I would
look for help in advocating
for that. Uh They are
political subdivisions
so they can, they can apply
for these grants, they can apply for the
that funding. Um
As far as I mean,
there's so many good things and so many
good people sitting at this table, it's
hard to, to hit them all and I'm
not gonna be
repetitive. So the
other thing, um
FFA and
AG
uh go
hand in hand
growing those kids,
letting them, they may
not have the opportunity where
they're raised to have
that, that,
um, sort
of engagement.
And so the pendulum
swings once again,
it was all about A and
FFA and
home economics.
Back in the day when I was
in high school,
the girls and the, the
boys all took
both.
Now, then the pendulum swung
again while that, that's not
good enough. You can
do better. Let's push
computers.
So, a lot of our
AG and
FFA teachers
were pushed out. I was on
the school board in Magdalena for 15
years and I fought hard
to keep that program
because it wasn't
really funded by the
state. Now,
we're pushing it again to,
to bring it back because of the
CTE because of the farming,
the whatever, raising the
animals. Um
And so
once again, I'll just say,
you know, I gave my junior
money to
FFA and 4h across the
state of New Mexico
for those programs because
we need
young people involved
in this process.
Um We
need to make sure that pe D
and that the state is funding these
programs as well and
giving them as much as they can do
a, as much as they can
handle. And
so, uh and actually, you
know, my husband and I have
been the sponsor, the state sponsor
of the FFA organization for
over 15
years.
That's how much we believe in it.
We're taking our private
money and putting it
in it and supporting
those projects and that
entity. So that's how
much we believe in
it.
Um,
meat processing
couldn't agree more. But
then I fought,
like I cried on the house
floor when the stupid bill finally
passed it was such a pain in the butt
to get across the finish
line. And
so
it's,
but there's so much more work
to, to be done.
And so let's, let's, let's
get to work, man. Come
on, let's get it done.
And I know the livestock board is doing
their best to do it. Thank you, Belinda
Garland for doing that.
And, and, and this
is how we get New
Mexico to move
forward, do things
that are actually good for New
Mexico and, and
grow our own,
let's grow our own kids, they're
there, let's
grow on. Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, representative.
Um So
just a couple of thoughts
when, when, when I
think about the future of farming,
I think about
landownership.
And um
I, I,
you know, I grew up in suburbs, I've
never, you know, lived
an agricultural lifestyle.
My belief is it's very
hard work and
you shouldn't have to farm or ranch,
someone else's land.
And one
of the big hurdles which we didn't
address in this panel, I
mean, it's, I think it's great to train
young farmers, but
how do we get them a
place to farm a
ranch if
it's not already in the
family.
Um I
think there are real estate tools
out there.
Um
Their conservation
easement might be a start
but just because the property has an
easement on, it doesn't
mean
a wealthy person isn't interested
in buying it and not
farming ranching
it. It just
prevents the development.
Um There's a tool called
an option to purchase the
agricultural value,
which is complicated
but
is a way to ensure
that piece of property stays
in production.
Um I
think we should be looking at lease
purchase agreements, uh
life estates, things like
that
and
providing resources
to
not only, not only people who
want the farm, but
people who own land.
And like here's a legal
mechanism where you can structure
a transaction
that someone who has a piece of
land that, that
loves their land and doesn't want to
see it developed can
get it to the next
generation
without um
you know, abandoning the value of that
land that there's a, there's
a fair transfer
to, to both the current
landowner and the, the
future landowner.
Um
And that's, that's something,
you know, I've had
conversations with people about
that for the past 20
years and
we honestly haven't made much
progress. Um
But I think it's, it's really
important. Um
It, it's not gonna do us much good
to train uh farmers
if they don't have some place to
farm.
Um So I
think that's it for this
panel. Thank you all very much
for your presentations.
Um So that's, that's the
last panel of the day. We still
have some, some
business to do
if you want to get up
and, and leave. Please do so
quietly. A couple
of things left for the committee.
Uh First off, uh,
Senator Pinto,
would you like to introduce
yourself? >> Thank
you, Mr Chair members of the committee.
I'm Senator Pinto. I represent
District three. I
am up in the northwest
corner of the state. Thank
you, Mr Chair. Thank >> you,
Senator Pinto. Uh We have
minutes in your
packet.
Do we have enough people
document? Ok.
Uh Senator Stefanik,
uh moves approval of the
minutes. Senator Woods
second. Uh,
any opposed.
Ok. So that carries
unanimously.
Um
And now we have public comment.
Ums do we have public
comment right
here?
Ok. So, uh we
do have public comment.
Um
Are, are these people
online or present?
Ok. And they're all online, I
think. Uh
So we're gonna do public
comment. Each
person will get uh three
minutes.
Um I
think
uh
Tom will uh enable
you to speak. Our first speaker is
Glenn
Wickle
Michael.
>> Hi. Can you hear me?
>> Yes.
>> All right. Uh Good
afternoon chairman mcqueen and
committee members. My name is Glenn.
We thank you for
providing me this soapbox
to speak from.
I'm an engineer and data scientist
at Santa A. I'm part of the National
Environment Justice
Group called Third Act,
founded by author and activist
Phil mckibbon, our new
Mexico chapter is new
this year and you
will be hearing more from us in the
future.
I love exploring the mountain back
country of New Mexico.
Global warming and climate
change are steadily replacing
our New Mexico Forest with
ugly burn scars.
Each time I hike in the
forest, I'm grateful that the
trees on my favorite trails
are still standing and
the natural ecosystems
are intact.
Yesterday, we heard that
the state of New Mexico has made
some progress in
reducing greenhouse gas
emissions. At the
same time, we learned that the state
is failing to
meet the goals of the Governor's
Executive order on climate
change.
Senator Stewart's comments
resonated with me.
We heard an assortment of reports
from agencies
but none of them appear to
be taking the reins to lead
a coordinated effort
to focus on greenhouse gas
reductions across the entire
state. And pardon
me if I misunderstood, but it
looks like the climate task
force is largely shut
down even though the job
is not done.
Laura Pasos, a journalist
gave the most encased report
a report which shows the urgency
of action and the
most informative statewide
report actually came from
Michael Bueno of
Edf, who's based
in Austin.
Let's not fool ourselves.
The situation is grave
and we are on the cusp of
irreversible damage to
the planet's climate systems.
Urgent action is needed.
Now, the citizens
of New Mexico need
and want you to
provide clear leadership
on climate action and
include the most effective
funding and legislation
in the 2025
session. I
second Mr Bueno's
high-level recommendations
take a whole of
government approach that
coordinates all agencies
codify statutory
greenhouse gas reduction
targets in line with
climate science and protect
actions already taken to
date to avoid backsliding,
require a detailed annual
progress report on these
goals and I have
my own two recommendations.
Number one, recognize
that wind and geothermal
are the oil of the future.
Invest as much as you can
in these in Statess. Number
two, increase the number
of inspectors to keep up with the
ever growing emissions of
methane carbon and ozone
precursors in our
extremely active oil and
gas fields. Methane
is 80 times more
powerful at warming the climate
than carbon dioxide,
reducing methane emissions,
makes air healthier
immediately and reduces
global warming faster.
Thank you for your valuable
time.
>> Thank you. Uh Next up, we
have Carrie Cox
Romero.
Do we lose her?
Ok. Uh If she
comes back, we can add her. Uh
Sandy
Stolberg
>> looks like I was
unmuted.
>> Sandy. Are you
there?
>> Get more of
that.
No, she
disappeared.
>> Ok. Let's go to
Tom
Patterson.
I
>> members. My name is Tom
Patterson. I'm a cow
calf rancher near Luna
in Kathryn counties.
I serve as president elect
of the New Mexico Categories
Association.
Thank you Mr Chair for
putting agriculture on the
agenda this morning.
That's exactly where it
belongs. New
Mexico Categories is
ready. Willing
and able to work
with you and
the legislature and
initiatives but safe
quality food
on the table for New
Mexicans. And
to that end, Senator Woods
is spot on this morning.
We do need, we desperately
need large animal veterinarians
in rural New Mexico
to help us care for our
livestock.
Representative case
labor is the safest challenge
we face on the ranks
as Representative Armstrong
mentioned. However,
other policies are
or will make it make that
challenge even part.
For example, the
anticipated 40 to 80
cent per gallon, clean fuels
tax in the last
session will make the
problem worse. The
prospect of paid family
medical leave will be
even more. So we
ask you to consider the extension
of paid family medical leave
for production. Agriculture,
Senator Stefani,
Representative Ferrera,
Representative Islam,
thank you for
understanding. The Department
of Fish
has allowed elk numbers
to get out of control
in certain parts of the
state. We
absolutely encourage you to
push for management policies
at G fish that
will protect New Mexicans
and our guests on our
highways and it
will allow for multiple
use of our land and water
resources.
Again, the New Mexico
Categories Association
is ready, willing and able
to work with you on
initiatives to put safe
quality food on
the table for New
Mexico. Thank
you.
>> Thank you. Um We do
have a couple of other people on
zoom. Uh I'm
not 100%
sure they want to make a public
comment. Um uh
TJ
Lopez,
>> right.
No comment. Mr Chair.
>> Just ok.
Thank you for that. And
Diana
Wood
>> unmute. Hello,
I'm Diana Woods. I
live in Santa Fe. I'm a
retired teacher.
I've worked all my life with
Children.
I am
also a member of Third
Act, New Mexico.
Uh, this is a,
an organization you'll be
hearing from.
It's 60 people
who are over 60 who
still care about our
environment and our
democracy.
I enjoyed
the beauty of this
planet all my life.
I'm 78
now.
I really
care that
it is still here for the
future.
And so that's why
I'm here today,
asking
you
please set
at a zero
emissions
target
by
2050.
And also
we fund
escape agencies
who are enforcing the
pollution and
methane
rules.
They need, we need money
so that people can make
sure that
those
rules are being
enforced. This is
for our people's health
and for our future
and thank you very
much for letting me
come here and
share.
>> Thank you very much.
Um I think that's
it for online. Uh
We have uh Athena
Creado,
>> I'm off
mute
chair mcqueen committee
members. Thank you for
your service.
We all know and we're all admitting
that we're in a climate emergency.
Ask especially the people
in Houston,
Ruidoso and
ACU I heard
um
others are losing homeowners
insurance in New Mexico for
their wildfire risk
insurance is a big deal
in California, Florida and it's
moving to New Mexico
and we've heard some
big level ideas
and, but here's one thing
that I don't think was brought up
yesterday and it's concerning
methane,
we know that it's 8080
times worse
in a short period than carbon
dioxide. We know
that a lot of it is
emitted in oil and gas
industry.
And, um,
and that it's a precursor gas
for the
troposphere
ozone. And while
methane itself isn't bad,
it um, causes
that ozone which is awful.
But in oil and gas production,
it's emitted along with hazardous
volatile organi organic
compounds. We
know that our oil and gas industry
does provide revenues to our
state based on net sales
and any loss means we
lose. And there was a
recent paper that
um showed that
new Mexico permian basin
emissions were not to be as much
as 9%
in the first half of
2024.
The New Mexico Environment
Department um
found that it
out of 75 out of
100 and 24 facilities
or 60%
released uh methane
and amounts in
excess of lawful
limits.
Um
Our um
NMED secretary
posted in linkedin
um and stated that with the
impacts of climate change,
ravaging our state and air quality
degrading, we have no choice
but to increase sanctions on
polluters. I'm talking
polluters until we see a commitment
to change behavior.
Now, there is
no statutory
requirement that well,
inspections be done in any
specific time frame.
However, there is
a requirement that
permits be
um given.
So the biggest
work that we can do
is to correct that
imbalance in new
permits, inspections
and corrective action. By
legislation, the
new legislation should
require that all new permits
applied for by a company be
paused until
inspections are done on a
company's existing wells
and compliance is
demonstrated
two that initial and follow
up inspections since we're
low in numbers of people going
out on site
use exo
atmospheric. I'm being fancy
here. Measurements generated
by methane sat the eye
in the sky for methane.
And that any
three any necessary
budgetary increases for
additional staff or technology
be levied on the gas and oil
companies through an increase in
permitting fees,
permitting and for
royalty fees. And
number five, until the new
regulation can be chaptered.
The governor issues an executive
order to this effect.
This is an emergency.
We don't have time to
wait. I know all of you want
to leave your Children
inheritance. How
about we also leave them a
planet?
>> Thank you. Um
And that's uh the end of
public comment.
Um So we, we are
not
adjourning. Uh
We are recessing
uh to go on our tour.
There is a tour
bus uh
available or you
can drive in private
vehicles.
Um I
think we're
leaving.
Has this been passed
out?
So, so we've passed
out the um
the sort of tour agenda.
This is a working lunch,
um local food
and we have three
different stops. Uh We
passed this out to the
members. Um,
I, I think we're leaving outfront
in about five minutes.
Uh, is there,
you know, I,
I would, uh, if you
could probably navigate
if you're driving a private
vehicle and you
have a, a navigation
system, I
would use the address rather
than like, we don't really need
10 or 20 cars trying
to follow each other.
Um, that might be a little safer.
Uh, any
questions about
the tours?
Uh
We do have
some, someone broaden some
apricots and we have,
uh, represent Rehs uh
Zucchini.
Um,
uh, to,
we please
take
one.
ok, so I'm a little,
I'm a little discombobulated in
terms of how we're gonna handle this
tour. Any, any
questions
are we? Yes, Ros
Matthews
wasn't clear. Is there
a bus from here?
I think the bus
and the bus is
out front, goes to each
stop and we'll come back here.
Ok. So we can leave our car,
you can leave your car here.
Ok. All right. Do
we have a couple minutes >> to get our
sunscreen out of our
cars?
>> Yes.
Ok. So we'll meet upfront,
I
think.
Ok. So, uh,
we're gonna turn off
the, you know, the
tour isn't going to be
webcast, uh,
because that's not feasible.
So we're gonna turn off the
webcast now. Thank
you, everyone who stayed with us.
Thank you to the committee. Thank
you to the staff.
