For

In 2022.
As part of the
Area in the city of Santa Fe.
Um
A statute, uh, regarding
historical areas.
And, uh,

I was being done in C if they

He said.
Case to case
You.
Your phone.
To demolish.
Building
is to be built, so it be built.
Best of the state capital.
And just north.
The legislative parking
structure.
It.
Certainly is occupied by the
Concha Ortiz, Concha Ortiz Pino
building and then for, um,
houses, uh, are commonly
referred to as the Casitas on
Dongas Park.
Um
The
Review Board. Uh, review the
request or
The to demolish the structures
on there.
They approved the demolition of
the Concha Ortiz penal building
and a garage behind it. Uh, but
the Ortiz Pino building was
contingent on approval of the
design.
Which is a separate issue from
what is going to be discussed
today, But but they did approve
that demolition with that
condition.
However, the board the historic
board did not approve the
demolition of the Casitas and
Don Gaspar.
And the process for resolving
the matter where the state wants
to demolish and build, But the
city does not want demolition or
does not want the construction.
The process for resolving the
matter is laid out in section
3-22 Dash six.
And that, um, requires
The appointment of a state local
government, Uh, historic review
board.
And the Capital Buildings
Planning Commission is charged
with appointing a member.
I inadvertently indicated in the
email before that it had to be a
member of this board of of this
commission, but that isn't
True, that isn't the case. It
just says to appoint a member,
and there are other references
to appointing members by
different entities that don't
require them to be, uh, members
Within five days of a notice
from the city that the issue is
not resolved.
Um
There was a meeting last night
of the Historic Review board,
and they formally accepted their
findings of fact and conclusions
of law.
With respect to not
Approving the demolition of the
four casitas.
So now that they have formally
accepted those findings of fact
and conclusions of law, they'll
refer that to the city and then
the city is going to issue a
notice.
That the matter is not resolved,
which, uh, results in the, um,
creation of a state local
government review board. So the
We all ask Michelle to send out
a copy of the RFP to the members
so that you have an idea of what
is being requested on the RFP so
that when you come in to meet,
um
Um you'll know what the the
requirements are and and then
our recommendations.
Thank you for that. That'll be
very helpful.
OK, And with that I would
entertain a motion to adjourn.
So moved
