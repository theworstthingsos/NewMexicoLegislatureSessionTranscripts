Mr Chair and members of the committee.
My name is Dr Allegra
Hernandez and I am
here today to discuss hospital
rates and accountability, which is in
Tab J and looks like
this.
New Mexican hospitals had
a net revenue of over
$334
million in 2022.
Concurrently, they are receiving
unprecedented subsidies from
both the state and federal
governments. But state
subsidies have uneven
financial impact and are
likely to help hospitals that are
larger and more profitable
rather than hospitals
that are currently
experiencing negative
profitability. While
hospitals post pandemic
have roughly the same net gains
as they had prior to the COVID-19
pandemic, profitability
varies greatly across the
state. And as a whole,
non urban hospitals are worse
off than urban hospitals
because of the large state
investment. The state has a
unique opportunity to increase
accountability of hospitals
within the state.
Further estimates show
government revenues will comprise
at least 74% of
hospital revenues in
2025.
Triggering concerns about
hospital viability across
the state.
If you now turn your attention to
page one, you will see
the profit profitability
varies greatly among hospitals
throughout the state. Nationally,
non urban hospitals
defined as either frontier
or rural are financially
struggling and many have been forced to
downsize at greater rates than in
the past. The same
is true in New Mexico of the
12 hospitals that experienced
losses in 2022
9 were classified as non
urban.
Moreover, when examining
2022 fiscal
data, New Mexico
hospitals experienced
approximately the same profit
margins as they did prior to
the COVID-19 pandemic.
Hospitals experienced a
financial windfall during the pandemic
that was unsustainable.
Additionally, the same number
of hospitals lost money in
2022 as in
2019.
This indicates that hospital
viability is the same pre
pandemic as post
pandemic
as seen in the second
graph. On page two,
rate increases for New Mexican
hospitals increased exponentially
in the past six years.
With New Mexico investing an
additional
$972.5
million between
fiscal years 24 and
25.
If you now turn to page
three, the healthcare
quality delivery and Access
Act or Senate Bill
17 targets
hospitals based on bed size
and performance, meaning that larger
hospitals will get a bigger
share. This is
somewhat caveat
by rural
hospitals getting an
additional portion of the share.
However, this act takes
advantage of the multiplier effect
of an almost 75% Medicaid
match with the assessment
providing the state's 25%
share and achieving a
$3 revenue impact for
every dollar invested.
60% of
dollars returned to the
hospitals are based on bed
size
analysis found the Act to
have uneven impact on
hospital finances.
For example, Rehobeth mckinley
Christian Hospital, which
lost close to $20
million in 2022
will receive approximately a
little more than $6.5
million from the healthcare quality
Delivery and Access Act.
This will not cover the full
expenses of losses
that Rehobeth faces and they
will have a negative net margin of more
than $13
million.
In contrast, Eastern New
Mexico Medical Center, which
experienced a 12% net
gain in 2022
will receive more than
$37 million
from the Act.
Eastern New Mexico Medical
Center earned close to $80
million in 2022.
If their earnings stay on track
profit in conjunction with
funding from the Act will
give them more than 100 and
$17 million.
You can see every hospital's
estimates on appendix
C on page eight.
More broadly in
2022 investor
owned hospitals made 100 and
$68 in net gains
million dollars. Excuse me,
in net gains. These
same hospitals will receive
an approximate additional
$281
million from the Act.
Only two out of 19
hospitals that were investor owned
are financially struggling.
Ultimately, this act does
not target hospitals
that are financially
insolvent
hospitals experienced
significant rate or investment
increases in recent years
and going forward. There is an
opportunity to increase
accountability and access.
40% of funds
allocated from the healthcare quality
and delivery Act are performance
based. Thus
far, the New Mexico Hospital
Association and Health Care
Authority have not created
metrics for urban hospitals
for non urban hospitals
as agree an
agreement was reached focusing
on eight measures. However,
these eight measures are
recycled and may not
focus on the most important items
such as improving workforce
access, workforce
or access. Excuse
me, when
creating the measures for non urban
hospitals, the health
care for urban hospitals,
the health care authority has a unique
opportunity to make certain
hospitals only receive
funds if performance
improves for New Mexicans
serves and served
and thus hold hospitals
accountable for the $1.1
billion they will receive in state
funds. I would
now like to turn your attention to
the graph on page
four. In
2022 government
revenues made up about
70% of total
hospital revenues within the
state. LFC
staff projected the share will
increase by 4% in
2025.
This gives the legislature a unique
opportunity to impact
change. First, the
state has the ability to hold
hospitals accountable and tie
accountability to funding.
Second, because
so much of the revenues that hospitals
receive from the
government, it may be possible
to either reduce costs or
medicate growth of revenues that
state employees pay.
Finally on page
five labor and
delivery cost to charge ratios
vary greatly across hospitals
and explain profitability or
lack thereof
cost to charge ratios
for 2022 range from
4% to
300%.
The cost to charge ratio at
Presbyterian is 4%
meaning it is making a
96% profit
on labor and delivery
services. At
the other end of the spectrum,
Alta Vista Hospital in Las
Vegas had a cost to charge
ratio of 300%.
This means that for every dollar
cost the hospital to provide labor
and delivery services, the last
hospital lost
$3.
Alvis has stopped providing
labor and delivery services in
June 2022
concerns remain for the other
10 hospitals charging less
than what it costs to provide these
obstetrical services.
I would like to close by saying
that the state and hospitals
will likely need to continue to make
difficult decisions
about when it is necessary to
close hospitals or sections of
hospitals. Of
note, if a hospital gains a
rural emergency designation,
they will receive an additional
5% in Medicare funds
and a yearly facility payment
of approximate at least $3
million. This may
serve as a solution for small
hospitals that have net
losses. One
hospital in New Mexico,
Guadalupe County Hospital
has thus far made this
transition. However,
the legislature is in a unique
position to ensure that in five
years, hospitals are not
in the same position as they are now.
Thank
you.
>> I'm just checking to make
sure uh
madam Secretary you
next
I don't know who we're going to next
>> Mr chair members of the committee.
I'm happy to go next or defer
I think that I was the third
person, >> a 15 page
presentation. So why don't you
go? >> I'm happy to do
that Mr Chair and I
will be quick. I was asked
to talk a little bit about rates, but
also a little bit about other
Medicaid stuff. So you've got that
in your slide deck
today. So
it's nice to be here with you all again for
an extended stay this afternoon.
Um On slide two
of your packet, I'm
going to give a little bit of an overview
about where we are with Medicaid enrollment.
That is a huge cost driver
for you
all to know about. And so I want to make
sure that you all understand where
we are with our Medicaid enrollment, especially
coming out of the Medicaid Public Health
unwinding, which has just
completed. We're all very
grateful for that. That process is
done, but happy to show you where
we are done now
that that process is
done. And then we're
going to talk a little bit more about
turquoise care and the MC O
accountability. Um some
new contract uh
requirements that are built
in. Um We don't have to
spend too much time on that. I know we talked
about it a lot this morning, but
it is built into my presentation
today. We'll talk about the
Medicaid rate increases that
we have implemented um
in fy 24 and
25 and
then how we are using data to drive
performance.
So moving on to
slide three, I will restate, I
will take just a moment to
do with the liberty
of announcing
our mission statement and
uh vision and goals for the health
care authority since they are
new, uh We are launching
the Health care authority. I'm gonna talk a little bit
about that today, but
our mission will be to ensure that
New Mexicans attain their highest
level of health by providing whole
person cost-effective,
accessible and high quality
health care and safety net
services with a vision
that every New Mexican will have
access to affordable health care
coverage through a coordinated and
seamless health care system.
Those are the North Star
statements. That's really where we're
headed. We're trying to lay a foundation
for how we get there. So
we'll talk a little bit more about that
today. Um On
slide four, I want
to just give you an enrollment
overview of where we are with
Medicaid. As
of March 2024 we're
projected to have
895,092
Medicaid members.
It's a projection because we
do have retroactive
enrollment. So there's
about a 90 day period of time.
In which people do come back on
retroactively. Uh So
it's not a final number, but that's
where we are. As of March
2024
we did have as a reminder,
a peak of 1
million and
5072
Medicaid members
prior to the Medicaid unwinding.
That is the, the month immediately
preceding the Medicaid unwinding. We
exceeded 1 million Medicaid
members for the first time ever in New
Mexico's history. That
was 48% of all New
Mexicans. Currently,
we are covering 43%
of New Mexicans and 60%
of all New Mexican
Children. We
did lose New Mexicans
from Medicaid during
the Medicaid unwinding. It
was quite a historic event.
Um We lost about
100 and 9980
New Mexicans. And
just to remind you that
prior to the
unwinding beginning, we had
projected and presented a projection
to this committee that we
would lose between
85,110
New Mexicans. Uh So
we are right within that
range. Um But
we are seeing a re enrollment rate
of about 45%.
So almost half of everyone who's
dropped off has come
back,
moving on to slide five,
I will cover this at a high level
but happy to answer any
questions. I I do want to
articulate again that the Medicaid
unwinding is complete.
Um And that the HC
A is now timely with Medicaid
applications and renewals
for many of you you probably heard
about from your constituents, a
backlog or delay.
Um That was true during the unwinding.
We are caught up really proud of
the team for, for really
kind of bringing it together to
manage that process.
Um It was an extraordinary
amount of work so really proud of
my leadership team and the
operations of the Income Support
division for um delivering
for New Mexico.
Um As I mentioned
earlier, we have about
134,000
people that have come back on or close
to 40
44%
out of a total of
302,474
Medicaid closures.
The highest reenroll rates
have been among people
receiving long term care through
our home and community-based waiver
program. So you can see in
the table on the right.
Um Exactly who has
re enrolled and who we lost
during the unwinding, but
about 70% of
New Mexicans have come back on to
those um home and community-based
waiver programs and adults
have re enrolled at about a
48% rate.
Children tracking close
behind at 47%
of kids.
We have been working really closely
with the federal government on flexibilities
during the unwinding two
things that are still pending.
Uh their agreement uh
was a request that the agency
made to reenroll all
Children who lost coverage
who are between the ages of
zero and six who
lost coverage prior to the
continuous eligibility provision
going into effect in January.
So they have not approved that yet,
but we are still seeking approval to
reenroll those kids.
We had also requested
approval to reenroll
people who lost
coverage who were enrolled
with the DD waiver program
or an institutional care
program. Just recognizing that those are
very vulnerable populations
who really don't have a lot of
income fluctuation
or changes in the level
of care. So, in trying to
protect those, we are still
negotiating those two provisions with
the federal government over
the next twelvemonth
period, we are expecting about
a 2.7%
annual enrollment growth,
which is slightly below
where we were pre
pandemic.
On slide six, I just want
to take a minute to remind you that our
turquoise care program, which
is the replacement for what's
today known as Centennial
Care will be starting on
July 1st. We are
currently in the open enrollment
process, meaning that all
Medicaid um
members who are with a, an MC
O can choose which health plan
they want to be with. Um
We are adding two
new MC OS to
the market. So Molina
Health Care you all may
remember from a time ago is
coming back and also United
Healthcare and Western
Sky Community Care is
exiting uh here in
New Mexico. So we will have four
MC Os Molina,
United Presbyterian and Blue
Cross, Blue Shield.
We've been making our way
all over the state uh we've
done 24 community events
almost everywhere
to make sure that our members
know exactly what's happening,
what the new benefits are for
centennial care and how they
can enroll with an
MC O or
switch.
Moving on to slide seven,
I am going to talk a
little bit more about
what we've implemented in the
turquoise care contracts around
accountability. They really
focus on and they
lead, they're sort of
connected to the conversation
this morning.
We have new financial
accountability, expanded
reporting and penalties that
we are imposing
enhanced operational
requirements, including MC
O, staffing and care coordination
and then specific accountability
for vulnerable populations.
So I'm going to go over this at a high
level. I'm on slide eight,
but just a few reminders
about where we are headed
as of July 1st
provider, reimbursements will
be tied to at or
above the Medicaid fee
schedule. So even
though I told you earlier,
the providers actually
negotiate directly with the
MCO is what those contracted amounts
are. They will no longer be able
to be below the Medicaid fee
schedule. So
whatever we have on there and that
includes those investments up to
120% of
Medicare that
is the minimum or the
floor. We
are going to have new performance
penalties for our
MCO failure to meet
their performance measure targets
will equal up to 3%
of their annual capitation payments
today. That amount is 2%.
So going up to 3%.
We're going to be basing our performance
targets on national averages.
We want to be striving for
better and making
sure that we are really
monitoring performance alongside
some of the best performing states. So
rather than just looking in our region
about how we should target performance, we
really want to make sure that
we're targeting those national
averages
and then failure to deme
delivery system improvement.
Performance targets
for the M CS will
be a penalty of 2%
of the annual capitation. So a
great again, an increased
financial penalty,
we are changing the medical
loss ratio from
88% to
90%.
The medical loss ratio is the
proportion of the capitation
payments that are actually spent on
clinical services. So I
was asked this question earlier
today, how much can the MCO
spend on administration
that is 10%
or up to 10%? So
that will be capped
at all that 90%
will go to clinical
services and
utilization.
Um In terms of community
reinvestment, the M
CS will be required to
contribute 5%
of their after tax underwriting
margin, which is their profit
to behavioral health focussed
community reinvestment. So
there wasn't really a requirement
that the MC Os do that in the
current contracts. So
that again, kind of tries to
leverage their profit,
insist that they
reinvest some of
those dollars here in New
Mexico.
And I talked a little bit about care
coordination. So I'm not gonna go into
this into in-depth, but we
are really focused on that care
coordination delivered by
uh community-based individuals
and entities. With a focus on the
high cost, high need,
medical complex
and population
vulnerability. Uh
For those
services.
Moving on to slide
nine, we have a number
of new provider network
and access to care
requirements. So
we have uh again as we
talked about earlier today, uh
an emphasis on improving access
to community-based models of
care including
community certified, community,
rural health clinics, and high fidelity
wraparound services.
New time and distance
standards for
access to care for all
of our membership appointment
standards for primary care,
dental care, behavioral
health, urgent
primary care and
maternity care.
New requirements for provider
training that the MCO S must do
to build, build up and bolster
our provider network new
requirements. I think this also came
up today, new requirements to
ensure the accuracy of their
provider directories.
So that members know exactly
where who which providers
are contracted with, which
MCO and
then increased accessibility
requirements including
for non-emergency, medical
transportation, distance
to 24 7 pharmacy
care and primary
care provider choice.
And then we have added requirements
around secret shopper evaluations
of member access. That was something that
the LFC has done.
Historically, I thought it was a very
helpful exercise. We're going to bring that
in-house and make sure that we do that
oversight of the
MCO. And then just a
reminder
with Children in state
custody, those
those Children in
CYFD custody we
have today accountability
spread across all of
our MCO. We
are going to be consolidating that
into a single MCO for
all Children in state
custody through
Presbyterian Health
Plan.
Moving on to slide 10,
you can put on your glasses
if that helps. Um
There, I do want
to thank you for providing
over 2 billion in
Medicaid increases since
2019. That support
providers and New
Mexicans. When you
look at the Medicaid cost,
about 58%
of the cost of Medicaid
is the result
of
rate increases and new
services um about
41% is due
to enrollment growth. So that's the
table on this side. So we're really
trying to amp up and make
the Medicaid program stronger for
New Mexicans. I do
want to say um I won't
focus on all of this history
here, but you can see all of the
investment since 2019
that we've been making.
Um in July
of 2023 we
increased that reimbursement up to
100 and 20% of
Medicare for primary
care, maternal child
health and behavioral health.
Um and then raised
everyone else up to 100% of
Medicare. We've
added coverage for community health
workers and we raised reimbursement
rates for DD waiver
services. And then
in January, we added
four new home
visiting models. As I
mentioned earlier,
commun continuous
eligibility for Children, age
0 to 6. We
banded the supportive housing program
to serve more people. We
expanded our community
benefit slots, those long term care
slots. We increased the
environmental modification
benefit and transition
services for our members.
We added legally responsible
individuals as caregivers
for Children who
or Children or
members who require
caregiver care.
And then we are in the process
of adding the chopra
chiropractic benefit
which is under federal negotiation.
But hopefully in the final stages of
that,
moving on to slide
11, um you
can see where we're headed. So
this is really what our fy
25 looks like in terms
of rate increases, we
will be Acti adding
doulas and lactation counselor
services effective in July.
We're raising the profen
professional dispensing fee for
community pharmacies in
July. Um doing
another DD rate waiver
rate increase in July and
adding a bilingual
differential to support
providers, serving
members who don't speak
English as their first language.
Also in July, we'll
be doing a rate increases for our F
Qh CS in October
and then doing that increase for
reimbursement to up
to 150% of Medicare
in January.
We will be also doing
that rescaling to
keep everyone else at 100%
in January. And
then we have a new initiative
to implement
rate parity for mid-level
providers so that they are reimbursed
the same level as physicians. So
those certified nurse practitioners
currently get paid at 90%
of the fee schedule, they'll be moving
up to 100 of the 100%
of the fee schedule.
We're adding
rate differentials for rural
preceptors,
$11 million for
directed payments to our 20 smallest
hospitals, vision
benefits for adults. And
then there are a number of New
Medicaid waiver services that
we're in the process of finalizing our
negotiation with the federal
government. But that includes
the justice involved
pres services,
medical that for
homeless individuals,
home delivered meals, for pregnant
members and people
receiving the community benefit
and support of housing the expansion
of the provider network.
So I do want to illustrate
it's a lot of, it's a lot of
work. There's a lot of work that goes into
that and which is why we actually
do believe that January is a
better timing for many of
those rate increases to go into
effect
on the next slide. Um I
just wanted to talk for a minute
about directed payments
because they are another avenue
that we are using to
also reinforce and
be bolster our provider
network,
Medicaid, directive payments
are used to direct
expenditures in connection with
implementing delivery system and
provider payment initiatives through
Medicaid managed care
contracts. They do
require quality
metrics and I'm going to
talk in a minute about the quality
metrics on the right hand side,
but they are always tied to
utilization and
quality. So those are the two
components that are required for the
direct payments and they always
must flow through the managed
care organizations.
We are currently utilizing
11 directed payments.
About 218 million
going out to hospitals,
81 million for
nursing facilities. We have one
for UN M Medical Group,
about 34 million
and then some additional ones
which we will be adding five more
directed payments
in 25 2 to
support rural obstetric
hospital services.
One to support publicly owned
ambulance services. That's
a, that's been a bill that has
been run through session. We actually just
worked with folks
to try and leverage publicly
owned
ambulance dollars
that are going to support those,
you know, and county ambulance
services so we can raise the reimbursement
rate. We're doing a primary
care value based purchasing
initiative and then we
have the Health Care Delivery and Access
Act which
Doctor Hernandez
just talked about. Um
we, that's a total
of about $1.3
billion being raised
through that directed
payment. I did want to just
correct one thing. The
hospital quality
metrics are there on the right
hand side and you can see
that they're pretty
standard, but I did insist
that we have two behavioral
health metrics so we can get um
people access to care
within those, you know, within
those discharged time
frames and
increase um our access
to screening in hospitals.
Um Those apply both
to the urban and the rural
hospitals. So,
and they are not recycled. They're
actually in use today
for the hospital value based
purchasing program, but they're in year
one. So it made sense
to carry those over. We haven't really
moved the needle on
those quality metrics
yet. So it made sense to really kind
of try to
uh create some continuity with
the program. I will
say that we are going to be
developing new metrics for
specialty hospitals
because today, we don't have a value
based purchasing program for specialty
hospitals. So for example,
rehab hospitals
will have new quality metrics. And
that's the part of program design
that we're currently
in.
On slide 13, I do want
to reiterate that we are using
data from these programs
to drive quality and performance.
Um You can see for
example that nursing
facilities are demonstrating
improved performance um
in the table on the right, uh
We are actually
hitting a target that's better than
the national average.
Uh And that is actually
something that we're seeing in these
programs. Uh They actually,
when you tie the dollars and
you incentivize quality
performance, it does seem to
work. So really looking
forward to building
out that hospital payment and
making sure that we're really tying
those dollars to both
quality investments and
reinvestment and services here
in New
Mexico,
I think you all know on
slide 14, what you can expect
or hopefully expect from these rate
increases. But we do hope
and, and think and the
hypothesis is
that by increasing
rates, New
Mexicans will
see greater number of
primary care providers
and more options, especially in
our rural communities that
we will actually be able to reduce
maternal morta mat
maternal mortality
for women, um which
is currently double the
national average. But through
adding both the
emphasis on maternal child health
services and the new services
like doulas and lactation consultants
that will actually make inroads into
reversing those
that data
that we will have improved
access to behavioral health
services that are
the financial stability of
our hospitals will be
stronger and
that individuals with disabilities
will also experience
improved access to
care.
And lastly, on slide
15, I just want to remind
you that the health care authority is
launching on July 1st.
Um It's a significant
moment for the State of New Mexico
that demonstrates our commitment to
prioritizing the health and well being
of every New Mexican.
So HSD, we are
sunsetting that name. You will no
longer hear us refer to
ourselves as HSD,
a little tug at the heart. I've been
with HSD for 24
years. So
it's a little bit of a identity
crisis for me, but I'm excited about
the future. Um
from the new
agency will include all of what
exists today as the Human Services
Department. Plus the
Developmental Disability Supports
division from the Department
of Health, the division of Health
Improvement from the Department of
Health, the State
Health Benefits Bureau,
uh from the General Services
Department and from the
office of the Superintendent of
Insurance, the Health care Affordability
Fund team. And what I
really want to emphasize today
is that even though there will be a new
look and feel you can see like our new
signage uh there on
the slide, um
our customers will not
experience any interruption
or delay in their benefits as a
result of this change and we will keep
things moving forward for them.
And that is the most important thing to
me. And with that
pay, we'll turn it
over to
you.
You're up next
>> bill.
Thank you, Senator Munoz.
Uh all the other
senators and representatives. I
appreciate the opportunity
to come and give an overview,
the progress that we're making
at raho of mckinley.
I'll start with a little bit of background
about myself so that you can
see um the
experience that I bring to this
uh challenging
time. I was originally
trained as a medical
technologist. I have a bachelor's
degree in medical technology.
I was certified by the American
College of Pathologists.
I worked as the bench
tech. That's what we call it in the
lab for eight years. Six
of them on the evening shift,
I worked my way up to be the
administrative director at
Porter and Littleton Hospitals
up in the Denver market.
I completed a Master of
Arts degree in Business
from Webster University
in Saint Louis. I'm
certified as a fellow in the
American College of Health Care
executives. I
previously had a nursing home
administrator's license. I've let
that lapse and I've
had the privilege to serve at
six different rural
facilities. I'd like to say
that if you work at a small
hospital, you get to live in
a small town. If you work
at a big hospital, you have to
live in a big town. And I
much prefer the small
towns. Most
recently I worked for seven
years in Taos,
New Mexico Holy Cross
as their CEO I actually
retired in October
of 22. Uh
but I came out of retirement
to help
serve here at Raho at
mckinley, a little
background as it relates
to the situation.
When I arrived on November the
13th, the accounts
payable from the October
Financials was
$33.5
million.
We had recently completed our
conversion to critical access
status.
C is what we call that
cah.
Um But we
hadn't fully embraced the model.
We hadn't been able to start
billing uh for
critical access status
because we didn't have the required
P A number from C
MS. We didn't get that until
the middle of
January.
We had converted to a new
electronic medical record
system um
almost two years ago.
And what I can tell you in
hindsight, we weren't ready to go
live. The system
wasn't ready for us to turn it
on and we're still
working to get it dialed
in. Uh In
fact, um I'm
expecting a proposal from the
company for
software that we need to
buy, that will allow
us to bill efficiently as a
critical access hospital,
as well as our new Swing Bed
program.
And then optimizing getting
our staff trained the
system dialed in as I
call it, that's going to cost
me around $230,000.
But it's money that I need to
spend in order to be more
efficient in our billing
and collections efforts.
And then to summarize over the last
three years. In
fiscal year 23 we
lost about 11.5
million. 22.
We lost 22 million,
21 we lost
$12 million. All of those
are unaudited
numbers.
So cash flow
was the big issue when I got
here. Um And
we had a joint meeting
between the county commission,
the city council,
um Senator Munoz
was at the meeting.
Representative Lundstrom
was at the meeting
and we reported that by the end
of December, we weren't going to be able to
make payroll. So
a plan was developed what I
affectionately called the payroll
Support program
that would provide payroll
support to us for six months,
12 payrolls
and a payroll cost me
just shy of a million
dollars. So
for rough numbers, we use
12 million, that's what the support
program was. And
the original design was
that the county would do 4
million, the city would do
4 million and the Navajo Nation
would do 4 million.
And then there was
discussion about the state
backfilling and I
must praise Senator
Munoz. He made the commitment
that the state would do that the state
has done that. Thank you very much,
sir.
Um So
we got the first payment at the end
of December
and the 1st 4 million
lasted through the middle of
February
um as you know,
significant appropriations
and that's where I
gratitude to all of you
for supporting the
money that has flowed to
Raho with mckinley or will
will flow
um
significant. So now we're
waiting on what I call the when and the
how the
details that need to be defined
for us to access that
money. The county
recently has awarded another
2 million in payroll
support
and I made a presentation to the
city council asking
them for another 2
million during
that time. So we've had
inflows of cash at
the end of November. We
had a $1.8 million
payment under the state tap
program. We've
received the 3.9
million that I described
from the city and county and
payroll support.
And we've been very active in
negotiating with our
vendors. We've reduced
our accounts payable by over
$2 million
through negotiations,
paying about a million
dollars. So the
average is about 48 cents
on the dollar is what we're
paying in these negotiations.
And those efforts
continue
with improved cash collections
once we were able to bill
very manually but still
able to bill under the
new critical access program.
We've been able to stay
more current with our day to
day bills. And as I
say, we've been able to
chip away at some of the smaller
accounts. Give
you an idea of some of the debt
that we have. We have more than
5 million we owe to one
staffing company. Uh
We owe the county 4
million for
rent. We owe
our computer
vendor, 2.5 million.
We owe the city
1.51 0.7
million for utilities.
And I have several other companies
that I owe more than a million
to.
So that's, that's sort of the
financial
situation
on the personnel front.
We've had strong
process progress
hiring new employees, many
of whom are former
employees, whether it's
that they found that the grass isn't
greener or whether
they just realize
that rehoboth is the
culture that they want to be part
of. Just this week. We
had seven new employees, four
of them were previous
employees. So we
find that to be a good indication
of the progress we're
making,
we have lost a few
doctors, but we're making
good progress, hiring
replacements.
And I just before this
meeting, I was meeting with my medical
staff talking about
recruitment efforts. One of
the ones that we're working on right
away is having
a robust cardiology
program, not interventional.
This would be basic cardiology,
but we need a cardiology
program to support our
and our advanced care
unit. And
then from a leadership
perspective, we are actively
recruiting for a chief
operating officer.
So I came out of
retirement but
only as an interim,
I want to see this through, but
I'm not looking for a permanent
job. So we're looking
for a chief operating officer
that I can mentor.
Um And then that person will
move into the
uh CEO role.
And so my commitment to the board
is that I will work at least through
the end of this calendar year
as they deem
necessary.
We've signed a new
contract.
So CHC
Community Health Corporation
is no longer part of our
organization. They ended
their service with us on the second
of May. We now are
contracted with
Ovation, what
some of you may know as
quorum,
same company that works
with um
Sibila in, in grants.
Um One of the
things that I can't talk
very much about, but I don't want to
leave the elephant in the
room, the big
lawsuit.
So there's a hearing
tomorrow about the
bond that needs to
be put
up in order for the
appeal process to move
forward. And
we're working closely with our
attorney to try and get this
resolved within the
limits of our insurance.
And I can tell you having
served at six small hospitals,
the amount of insurance that
we have here. Rehoboth
mckinley is greater than
any other hospital I've been
at. But because
of the way that the judgment came
down, judgment
almost doubles what our
current uh insurance
coverage offers.
We were happy to
be part of the
work to get
G IC through
their water repair issue.
We opened up two of our
units to them. We
assisted with getting
their doctors to be able
to work under New
Mexico licensure
as well as their nurses.
Happy to report that that
repair went well
and all of their patients
were returned to
them. And then
the last comment
that I would make is that we
are not out of the woods.
We still have a lot
of hard work in front of us.
But today, I
can show you the path
that we need to take to get us
out of the woods very
different than where we were in
November and December.
And with the
funds that have been
appropriated as they
flow later this
year, we will be
able to retire.
I'm convinced all of our
debt, not just
some of it, we're going to be able to
all of our debt. And
so I'll end by
saying, thank you very much for
your support of our.
We are going to make sure
that we continue to
honor the trust that you've placed
in us with the funds that you've
provided. Thank
you.
>> A question from committee
members represent
pains.
>> Thank you, Mr
chairman.
Uh Thank you for this,
this report. I think in terms of
the hospital funding, I I wanted to ask
some questions about
the
performance
metrics
that are um
going to be evaluated as part
of the Health
Care Access and
Delivery
Act.
Um
I I see a bunch of metrics
that really refer
to
safety.
Um you know,
ensuring that that
hospital acquired
infections are not
um
uh too prevalent
that patient
patients have a chance to weigh in
on the communications they're having
with doctors and nurses.
Um I'm just curious, are there
other measures?
And perhaps our LFC
evaluator could, could
speak to this? Are there other
measures that you would recommend to talk
about access?
Because you can't,
you can't actually
check whether
a service is provided
safely or not if the service
is not provided at all.
Um And so
if we
have facilities
that are potentially shifting
the types of services they
provide um
making some services
less available than they
were previously, I
don't think these measures
really
um get
at whether the services
are either continuing to
exist or whether they're expanding
or contracting. It's just
simply saying
if you enter this hospital, are
you safe? Are you getting good
communication? Are you
coming out without an infection?
Are you not going to be readmitted?
So, is there
something that that needs to
be added to this to really look
at access to
services as a
basic uh tenant
of what the
I think a big part of the
intention of that bill was was
to really protect
rural hospitals, make sure
that hospitals stay open and that they
continue to provide all of the
services that
communities
need.
>> Yes, sorry,
I didn't mean to cut you off
Mr Chair. So first I would like to
clarify and apologize.
We were told by the New Mexico
Hospital Association that the
metrics for urban hospitals
had not yet been chosen.
Um So my apologies
on having that incorrect
in terms of
access, there are certain
measures that we could look at in terms
of how
long patients have to wait
for appointments or surgeries or
things like that. And
then the other
area that
we believe should be looked
at in terms of improving
the system and ensuring
that hospitals are not in the same
place as they are five years from
now is looking at
workforce and what are
hospitals doing to retain
and recruit new workers.
And so we believe that
if you hit on access
so that individuals want to
come back and are able to come back to
hospitals and then
there are enough services in these
hospitals so that individuals
are able to go to them and not
have to drive to UN m
then that those
measures might
work.
>> Thank you, doctor. I, I was
thinking along the same lines
um particularly because we
know we have healthcare workforce
issues and
I don't know how
we get at the way
that workforce feels about
the policies
of the
entity at which they're
employed. Um But I feel like
that's a piece of this that I have
heard from providers
in my community about
um some of the dissatisfaction,
some of the hardship that they have is
around scheduling and
compensation and
leave policies, call
policies. Um
So I think the workforce is
a really big issue that we
should look at.
Um So
just to suggest
to the secretary madam secretary
as you're going forward, I think it would be
great to look at
um
the workforce
issues, the timeliness issues
in terms of provision of care
for hospitals
who are receiving these funds.
And then um
there, I don't know if there are
other places where we look
at adherence
to standard of care
um in providing
these hospital based
services. But I feel like
that's a piece
here that we should be looking at
going forward in
terms of like quality
improvement, quality of
care. Thank you,
Mr Chairman.
>> Thank you, Representative
Armstrong.
>> Thank you Mr Chairman.
>> And you're the
third
>> uh for your presentation.
I I have
a a few questions but the
main one
is
on the distribution
of the fund, isn't
it?
Isn't it based
on
number of Medicaid
patients served and
not the number of
beds?
>> So
would you like to answer that?
My understanding was that it was
based on bed size. Um
after reading the bill
that that may be incorrect. >> According
to
secretary
uh Mr Chair
Representative Armstrong,
the distribution of funds is
always tied to one or one
of two things. It's either
actual actual
patient volume,
so actual
delivery of care. So
an actual discharge or
the quality of payments in this
particular
program, it's sort
of the rural and urban
hospitals are classified
differently. So the
rural hospitals are actually
paying a lower share of
the assessment and getting a
higher share of the payments. That's
like it's really kind of based
on the older
program was based on bed
size, the safety net
care pool that we're kind of
trying to move away from.
That was based on like small,
medium large hospitals.
We've really kind of focused this
program on rural versus
urban with
those urban facilities,
kind of picking up a greater
share of the the provider
assessment but getting a
lesser distribution of the payment.
However, because the payments
are always based on actual
utilization, most
of the patients are in their urban
hospitals, there will
be they're
volume based payments and so they
will be tied
to, you know, there
will be some
dollars that go out to the urban
facilities, but they are
paying a
greater share for
less of the distribution of the
dollars. >> And
Mr Chair Representative Armstrong,
if you turn your attention to page eight on
the report, uh
the third
column, which is the sp
17 allocation estimate
for fiscal year 26.
This was derived in part
from the New Mexico Hospital
Association as well as my own
estimates for the 40%
performance based,
but that's what each hospital will
be receiving. So as you can see,
large urban hospitals will
be receiving more
of the share
than non
urban hospitals.
>> Uh Thank you for that. And
so the the other question I have
is So Socorro
General Hospital is
Presbyterian. So it's
not lumped in with
Presbyterian. It's its
own line item. Is that correct?
>> It is its own line item. And you'll
also see the second line
is Santa Fe Medical Center which is
also Presbyterian.
Um and so
Presbyterian
cost reports are separated
are disaggregated by each
hospital and so is
loveless as well.
>> Ok, thank you for that.
I am I,
I'm I'm
curious, is,
uh
will the bridge funding
uh from Senate Bill 161
get to rural hospitals
before the money
before this money? And when will
it be
>> Mr Chair Representative
Armstrong that bill uh
assigns our agency to get those
distribution of dollars out.
So we're targeting as soon as
possible. So yes,
the the dollar payouts
will start for the
HDA A program, I believe
in March of,
look at my team, March
of 2025. So
those dollars will actually
definitely be out before then.
Um So that's the goal I
think of is sort of issuing that
bridge funding while the hospitals
wait. >> Thank
you for that. And have, have the
hospitals been able to
view any of this
data?
>> Mr Chair Representative
Armstrong, are you talking about the data that's
in the LSU report? Yes.
And I think the hospitals were closely
involved in the development of the program
actually. So they, they all
saw what those net margins would
be. >> Thank
you for that. And, and in
your humble
opinion, I wondered
what else can the legislature
do to
help ensure
that um
this is a fix and
that, and to support
hospitals, especially
uh rural New Mexico, I
want to support all hospitals,
but I represent
rural New Mexico. So is
there something else you can think
of that we could do to help
support you
in uh
making this happen or, or
other things that we could
do?
>> Mr Chair Representative
Armstrong? Thank you for that
question. I
actually think
that the
bills, the two bills
actually work really well
together. We
know that our rural hospitals
have been in a crisis
when you're operating
at a really thin margin.
There's just no way you can
invest in anything else.
But I think the
net, the innovation
here of this new
provider assessment program is
that every hospital will walk
away to the net
positive
with, you know, really
positive investment
that then is required to stay here
in New Mexico and build out the
services. So the
quality metrics are just one
piece of this program.
We will be sort of overseeing
the hospitals to make sure
that they're spending those dollars here
in New Mexico. Those dollars aren't going out
of state. I really
look at this as a long term
fix for our
hospitals. We've been
struggling for years
since the sunset of the safety net
care pool program.
The Sunset Medicaid
no longer supports uncompensated
care payments. So all of that
has really, really
uh our rural hospitals have borne
the brunt of those federal
changes. This is a
really innovative way of raising,
I mean a billion dollar over a
billion dollar investment in New Mexico
hospitals plus
sort of maintaining
that, uh, reimbursement
rate in Medicaid, you know, sort of that
solid Medicaid reimbursement rate. I
think those two things together really,
we looked at those as very long
term solutions for the state of
New Mexico. The
program does have a
sunset clause in the
bill. So you all have to pay
attention, see if it's
working. Um, you
can, you know, make adjustments
legislatively if it seems
necessary, but I think it
kind of gets at the triple aim.
There are the quality,
the access to care
and making sure that
it's sort of that safety net is
there for New Mexicans. I really
do. Thank
all of you for coming together
to, to support that bill. I think
it was a really good innovative
solution for our
state.
>> Uh Thank you for that. Thank you, Mr
Chair. I know um in
my rural district,
the hospital is actually
taking steps to
try to mitigate um
er visits.
So, you know, they opened up
um an urgent
care where they have a
clinic but
they, you know, the getting an appointment
is a whole another story.
So they opened an urgent care
inside of their clinic
and kind of split that in half
and it's really
mitigated the
er visits.
And so I think
uh them having skin in the game
uh by doing that,
wanting to survive, wanting
to stay open.
I mean, if, if Presbyterians
Coral General Hospital
closes their, their
labor and delivery.
It's gonna be
detrimental to, to my
district and to the Alamo
Navajo reservation and
that they deliver a lot
of babies in that hospital.
So anyway, thank
you. So for the answers. I
appreciate that. Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> I'll turn this on
also.
I've been 24
years with the department
when I was elected
almost six years
ago. One of the first
calls I got was from the
Secretary of Health and Human
Services said, Jack,
why do I have no
enrollment in Harding County?
None uh
very little in
Union County. So
it's because you don't have an office
there. So, well, I
have an office
in Las Vegas.
I said the
Harding County is remote
and the the population
there are
elderly and they
cannot drive to Las
Vegas. Well,
they can do it on a computer. They
don't know how to use a computer.
Their Children can help them. Their
Children move to
Albuquerque to get a
job.
So what do
we do? I
said if you would put a
office
in probably
Union County
and we talked
about it and II,
I imagine you were
in on this uh
put an office in Union
County and then
that person or a
person would travel to
the surrounding
communities. Mascaro,
Roy Clayton
has the office uh
Logan
and uh help these
people because
prior, the
only help they had was the
ladies that work in the lunch
room, you know that serve
the senior meals would
help them try to fill out
their various
uh things. We put
that office, y'all put that
office in,
in Clayton,
got it up and running
almost immediately. We were hit
by COVID and had to shut it
down.
Uh,
when I got out of
COVID,
y'all came back
and I'm looking at the
100 and 48 here in
Harding County,
uh, 1262
in, in Union
County.
And
so
first thing is, thank
you. It did
work and it did help the people
there. Second
is the, is the
question
uh
where are we at right now?
What's happening with that?
I know that uh there's some,
some things going on
there.
>> Um Mr Chair
Representative Chatfield,
you're welcome. And we were
happy to show up and
be part of
those communities. Um
Actually, I think that
um setting
up offices in
Clayton and Roy was really
instructive for us and it's
something that I'm actually looking at
expanding in our agency.
I having more satellite
offices where we go out to
communities, making
sure that we're at chapter
houses and other places
where um you,
so New Mexicans don't have to travel
to get access to our care.
So we, we are focusing
on that model. I do
believe that we
had one of the offices
where people were
not coming to
us. So we, we've kind
of reduced our hours there.
I think it was at the Roy office.
We, we did do some
additional advertising to the
community to kind of try to make
sure that they know that we're there.
Happy to restart
that. I mean, we were
available
now that we're through the Medicaid,
unwinding. I think we're, we have a little
more bandwidth to really explore
and offer that partnership up
to all of you. Actually,
we areas where you feel like you
want to stand up a satellite office
from our agency
and we will do that, we will partner
with you. So if if there's
an opportunity for us to
do that better,
happy to have that conversation
we are still standing up, I believe
in Clayton and going out
there regularly. So,
>> Mr Chair, I appreciate
that and I appreciate the office in
Clayton. I don't think
we need a permanent office
in Roy. I think,
uh, in, in these Roy
Mosca, some of those places, if
someone will come there
to the meal site
one day a month, one day a
week, uh, one day, probably
one day a month or,
uh, as needed.
Uh, that
gets people the ability
to get some help in filling out
their paperwork. These
people are, they live in
a very remote
area. They don't even have a
grocery store. We recently
worked with aging and
long-term services to
implement a grocery
service where they can
call and order their groceries
and get them delivered out there because
they're, they're elderly, they
can't drive and go get them, you
know, and, and they
oftentimes don't have family
to help them. Uh,
uh, so I appreciate
that. I appreciate the effort.
I think it, the
numbers tell the story that
it has worked and,
and I urge you to
con,
uh,
you don't have to maintain
an office there but don't just
walk, quit or walk away.
Please, please set
up a certain certain date,
come, come there that
so that people can
talk to you about their problems
and so that you can sign
up more people as you need.
And thank you for doing
that. That's all Mr
Chair
Thank you.
>> I
it looks like
your
and I completely expect
y'all out of
you.
>> You all know it.
>> So, thank you, Mr Chair.
Um
uh first
uh ask a question
on page eight, the chart on
page eight.
we're, it's comparing,
I think anyway, we're
comparing the new
distributions
against
fiscal year 22.
Am I? >> That is
correct, Mr Chair and
Committee?
>> But as I look at some of these other
things in here, there looks like there's
an awful lot of volatility,
volatility.
Yeah, that word doesn't go with
y'all.
Um
So I I think it would have
helped if, if
we had a longer set
of time, multiple years
maybe uh that
I could compare and, and
just look at trends
and, and
costs
AAA AAA I think that would help. But
also does any of this account for
inflation? I
mean,
I'm not sure what hospital
inflation has been
recently, but
if you put in $100
and inflation goes up 100 and
10, you've not done
anything.
So does this account for
any inflation?
>> So Mr
Chair Senator,
so we do actually
have figures dating back to
2019 from these
hospital cost reports.
And then we have C MS cost
reports from 2012
to 2018.
And I'm happy to get those to
you on
the CM reports. Look
at states
in our region as well as New
Mexico breaking down
a statewide and
then the most
recent 2019 to 22
cost reports, look at hospital
by hospital.
Um but
what I can tell
you is that
we have not adjusted
for inflation. And
so
the 22 number,
we don't have anything more recent than
the 22 number, but there are some
issues in terms
of it,
not
um
adjusting for the rate
increases that
happened. And so it's
likely that hospitals net
income actually increased from
22 to 24.
However, with that being
said, with inflation and several other
factors, these are the
most comparable numbers that
we could get to.
>> All right. So one
of the things that you talked about here
and I know it was in the bill, but I'm
not. But
as you mentioned, it, it, it really
sparked something in me. So
we're limiting the,
that
the
90% of the money has to
stay in the State of New
Mexico. 10%
of it can flow somewhere else.
I mean, explain
that because I'm, I'm, I'm very
confused now,
>> Mr Chair
Senator Sherry, I think you just
got the proportion
flipped. So
90%
stays in New Mexico.
Yeah. So the dollar, the
reinvestment here in New Mexico,
I believe it's 90%
75%. I'm sorry, I'm gonna
have to go back and look, but
that, that larger share
insists that the dollars be
spent here in New Mexico, the
agency will be overseeing
that to make sure
that the dollars
aren't flowing back out to corporations
outside of New Mexico.
And so that I think you just have
the, the, the proportion
flips there.
>> I probably said it wrong. I understood
that. But
so 10%
of this money from
uh
from
can go to profit to,
to corporations somewhere
else
as opposed to serving New
Mexico.
>> Mr Chair, Mr
Chair Senator,
I think there's multiple components.
So there is an administrative
share that gets retained by the
agency that has to be built
in so that we can
administer the program. So some
portion of the dollars is coming to
our agency. I believe
it's 1% of the
fund. There
are taxes that have to
be built into the capitation
payments. So for example,
premium tax gets built into
the capitation payments for the MC
O and then actually we
have to pay them for that, that
gets been generated back to New
Mexico. So it's kind of complicated.
That's the 10% that I think you're
referring to, which is just the
administrative
side of the program.
It's shared by the
agency and the MC
O. Those,
most of those costs are really
the MC O costs that we're federally
obligated to build
into those capitation
payments. Then there's the
75% sort
of reinvestment in New
Mexico. Recognizing that
hospitals
do often
purchase supplies out of
state, for example,
um have those, you know,
have to do that, ordering
of things outside of New Mexico. So
recognizing that there is a portion
that uh won't be
here in New Mexico. But by and large
those funds will be um and
then there's just a small administrative
share.
>> Ok, thank you. Thank you. That actually
helps a lot there because I was,
I was concerned uh
as I looked at it that,
that 10% of this money
went toward profit to
somebody else. And yet
San Juan Regional has a minus
2% profit.
So it didn't
sound good to me. But I
think I understand.
And then the last
and maybe the most important part of
this is
so a lot of this
of course, is to keep the
hospitals
alive.
But are we providing any better
service? Are we treating the
patients ways
that we weren't before we,
we taking care of them any
better? >> So
Mr Chair, Senator
share one
thing that I would say is that
the measures that
we are
recommending in terms
of accessibility and work,
workforce
access and workforce
would help to
work to ensure those.
But at this point, the eight
measures which you can
on page
four do not
necessarily ensure that New
Mexicans are going to be better
off five years from now than they are
>> current Mr
Chair. I
strongly disagree with
that statement. Those quality metrics
are based on standard
quality of care. What we're trying to
do is improve quality
in our facilities. So we're
going to be tying those dollars
for moving the
needle on those quality
metrics. But those are, those are standard
quality metrics that are widely
accepted. Um
That doesn't mean that we won't be looking
at. And I think the suggestions made
by the committee staff are
really excellent ones
around adding some
process metrics that are
really around supporting
workforce and new
services. I'm absolutely open
to that and I think we can definitely take
that back and look, but I think those quality
metrics are widely standard
accepted. Um
And what the goal is is
partially to improve
quality of care at
facilities. And so
we're not just paying
facilities to
um just
provide due services. We
also want to make sure that the
quality of care that New Mexicans
are getting is good
quality of care and those are standard
metrics that are used across the
health care delivery system.
Um So I I do
respectfully disagree with that
assessment.
>> Well, Mr chair
madam secretary,
I
I can see that there's never a
guarantee of anything,
uh, from her perspective,
but, but I do appreciate the
idea that, that we're trying to build
this in. So we've got quality of
care, not just money to the
hospital.
Um, earlier today
I, I talked about,
uh, um,
people going to the emergency
department versus
primary care because we
lost 500 doctors.
Well, part of that was what
happened to Rehobeth where they got a
judgment for 18 zillion
bucks or whatever it was
uh far beyond
anything they could
sustain.
I think that's something that we need
to
be very cognizant
of when I, when I asked
earlier,
how do we make sure that we've
got the providers
and the care
while the insurance part of
that is not directly you,
if we don't fix that,
you fail.
And I think Rebus is the perfect
example of that.
So
yes, I know that's not
exactly on you,
but you're the one that's gonna get
blamed if we don't fix
it. So thank
you,
Mr,
>> thank you all, Mr
Chairman and thank
you to our presenters.
So Allegra
on page
eight.
Oh,
with the information, this is
from 2022
>> Mr Chair and Senator.
That is correct. >> So
it's possible that these
numbers could be higher or
lower. >> It is absolutely
possible. So we will have
2023 figures.
The agency has told
us late July to expect
those figures.
But because of
the way that the cost reports are
turned in and
the sliding the basis
in which they are turned in.
We do not, these are the most recent
numbers that we have
>> and with that Mr
Chairman. So when do you think we would
have the 20
three?
Very well. Uh
Thank you for that.
And, uh, and Bill nice to see
you.
Uh, so,
uh, uh, you mentioned that,
um, I'm just asking,
I guess just more
for,
uh, that you pay
rent to the
county.
And is that pretty
standard with?
Uh,
>> so I, I don't know that I would say
that it's standard. It's not
unusual.
Um We are currently in
negotiations with the county for
a new lease that
takes a different approach
as far as
how rent dollars
are accounted for and
how charity or
indigent care dollars
are accounted for. So
I'm very optimistic that
the new lease with the county
will position
us in a much more favorable
position.
>> And Mr Chairman,
so was that the same
with Taos? Did they pay rent
to, to the
county? >> Yes. So they
did.
>> I never thought of that. I
thought it was just, I know
that the county own
owned the building
but that
there was rent involved.
>> And Mr Chair, Senator, if
you may, I'd like to add just a
little bit of perspective on the
prior conversation.
Um, so Senator
to your question of the
quality, the
first thing you have to do is keep the hospital
open. Um
And then I would make the point
that standard of care
is always improving.
So the, the criteria
against which we are measured
by our external
certifying agencies, the
regulatory agencies
isn't the same from every
year after year,
it has to get better.
And so as part of that
natural progression,
natural evolution of
health care, getting better
by assuring that we stay
open, you have in
fact improved the quality of
care to
the citizenry.
And, and then for
Representative Armstrong, you
ask, what else can you do?
I would suggest two specific
things. One many
hospitals are struggling
as it relates to the age of their
building. And,
and I would suggest that
a partnership between the States
and the federal government to
bring back the Hilb Burton
Act or a version
of it to address.
And this would be beyond what
the State Finance Authority
can do. The dollars would be much
larger, but to
address aging
infrastructure, that would
be something that certainly the smaller
hospitals would
be very thankful for.
The other. Ask that I would add
to the list would relate to
insurance.
So that's been touched on
sort of tangentially,
but I would
use either the Federal Tort
Claims Act
or
State
immunity programs
that if, if those
can be applied against
at least the small
rural facilities
that would go a long
way
to helping us with the
burden that we currently bear
to cover all aspects of
our insurance, property
insurance, malpractice, insurance
directors and officers,
insurance.
So if, if that's
something that the legislature
could help with, that would be
a specific ask on my
part.
Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. I
guess I just want to make a
comment and,
and this is just
me, but I really
have a hard time
when government
to government. I could
see that if it was a
private
but, you know, with the
counties are
receiving
rent because
it's the same for the same
people, you know.
And, uh,
and if that wasn't
there, it's the same thing with
charter schools having to pay
rent to public
schools. I mean,
it just doesn't make sense to
me, you know, but I'll leave it at
that. Thank you, Mr
Chairman
>> Quickly Mr
Chair,
we're going to
bring from the General
Services Department,
the Employees
Benefit
Bureau
and I know
this, you may not know the
answer to this. But
is, is that
fun solvent
or is it insolvent
Mr
Chair?
>> Uh, Mr Chair,
Senator Woods, I'd
like to thank this
body for shoring up the
fund. I think
it
has.
It is. So in
now, sort of
the way I look at it.
I think there's a lot of work
to be done after
having spent
the last year,
really kind of trying to dig
in a little bit deeper
in how that fund is
managed
proactively. And
so that's going to be like number one
priority for me is making
sure that we set that up
with some
uh proactive management
of the fund. Um some
more scientific calculations
around how healthcare
utilization trends
are for that population
that's covered what the
projected costs will
be. So that when
we make decisions
about
premiums, for
example, and
dollars to support the fund
that we're doing that together with all
of you fully
informed on how
um how those dollars will be
spent and what those, what
the need is. So
that's, I think that's
the best I can do for now. We've got
a lot of analysis going
on just to really
make sure we understand what we're
getting over at our
agency. Lots
of
sort of analysis
about uh the
trend utilization
cost, uh what
we're paying providers, all of that stuff
is happening right now and I'll have better
answers for you probably in a couple
of months um from, from
that analysis, but I
do as of right now, the fund
is solid.
>> Thank you, Mr
Chair.
Thank you madam
secretary. Thank you for your help on
that food bank issue.
I appreciate that very
much. Thank
you, Mr Chair.
>> Thank you, Senator.
You know, uh you brought
up that health care
premium cost and
that was a big chunk that the
state should have never had to pay because
it's a violation of the statute. I
mean, at some point,
the state should have never spent that
what we end up at 120
million or something
to, to shore that back up. So
it transferred over without any
deficit. I mean, that was a
cost. The state should have never
had to bear in 100 and 20
million because it was cities,
it was counties, it was
everybody's health care
that we picked up
that portion of back
bill. So
that's something we should,
it sounds to me, I
guess
that once we go back, we're gonna
really have to look at Senate Bill
17 and do some
tweaking. But I mean,
the ultimate question is
we're going to get $1.3
billion.
How is that gonna improve
our health care in New Mexico?
What is the number one
control to say? We're
gonna have more doctors at R MC
H or have a heart doctor at R
MC H. We're gonna
have more
podiatrists or whatever it
is in every
corner when they get
the benefit of this money.
What is, what
is a requirement for them to
say
you have to improve your health
care in order to be
eligible
>> Mr Chair? I guess I'll
start with
my thoughts related to that question,
but since there's a hospital at the
table might be
useful to hear directly from
a facility about how those
dollars will be invested.
Um Having
been with um
Medicaid, you know, for many
years prior to this
role and then
being deputy
secretary and now secretary,
one of the ongoing themes
has really been the financial
solvency of our hospitals.
Um I would say that
we have kind of had a
patchwork of strategies,
most of them have not had any
quality connection
whatsoever. And you all
talked this morning, the
quality of care and
making sure that
we improve
the quality the outcomes.
So having some quality
metrics and again, happy to take a
look at those metrics and think
through some process measures that we
could add potentially around
workforce etcetera.
I think you would be in
five years able to see how
your facilities in New
Mexico are performing,
what services they're providing
and where they've invested
this $1 billion
that they're getting so
that we would know how many more
people are being served in our
communities. How many people
don't have to travel to Albuquerque
for cancer care, but they can
get how many people can deliver a
baby in their community because
now there's a hospital doing it.
That is the long term, you
know, that's the five year plan.
So I really think it's going to
make a difference. We are going to
be watching the hospitals to make
sure that they are reinvesting those
dollars in New Mexico.
Um The expectation is not
that they just send those out to the
profit centers, but
that they really reinvest.
I'd like to see them build out
outpatient behavioral health services.
I'd like to be a part
of that and we'll be partnering
with them and we'll be watching to make sure
that happens. So
it's really, you know, each
community will decide what services
they need and what the gaps
are and we look forward to working
with the hospitals on
that. But I think
um maybe we are
on sort of the brink of a
really robust investment
in the health care of our communities and
not just hospital care, but
really like everything that's connected
to the hospital as
well.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
Um So from
a sort of foundational
perspective on Senate Bill
17,
um the small hospitals
are going to pay 19% of the
cost, we're going to get
40% of the revenue.
And I understand that the big
hospitals get more money,
but that's a pretty good
deal to me that I'm paying
19% of the cost and
getting 40% of the
revenue.
Um Our
goal
in the time that I've been here
has to get the hospital
much closer to a breakeven
level.
And so we've been working
both sides of the equation. We've been
working the expense
side. We've done
a small
reductions in
force, but our real
focus has been on the volume
side, the revenue.
So a year ago,
if I were reporting to you,
I would have said that we were doing
70 to 80 surgeries
a month for the last two
months. We've done almost 100 and
30 surgeries
tomorrow. We're going to start
doing cataract surgery
at our hospital again. We haven't
done that in years
and when the program is up
about a month from now, we'll
be doing 20
patients a day, 22
days a month, adding
a service. So as
we've planned for the
money and the,
the proforma that I was given
said that we will benefit.
So tap goes away.
Hap goes away. Dish
goes away. But
net of those three
and of our cost,
I was told that our benefit
will be a little bit over $11
million. That's
a huge number for
an organization our size. And
so I've been trying
to prepare the board thinking
about how we're going to use that
money. And I've
suggested that we split it into
three different buckets
and not equalized buckets,
but three different buckets. So
the first one is compensation
and benefits. Um
take care of our people
first. Um
And the
benefit we need to add is
retirement. We currently don't
offer a retirement benefit,
our benefit program, other than
that is quite robust, but we
don't offer retirement
in order to be competitive. We're going
to need to add that. Number two
is medical equipment.
We have been capital
starved for the
last several years.
And so we need to start
replacing medical
equipment
and then number three is
savings, we
need to have some
reserves.
And so this influx
of new money
will allow us to accomplish
those three things. And
if we are successful in
positioning the hospital
much closer to a
breakeven level
than we were a year from
now, then our
use of the
money from Centreville 17
is going to be much
more
prospective than
it is reactionary.
Um So,
so I'm excited about the bill.
I believe that the bill
um if it doesn't get
changed too much
has the opportunity to
provide me long term
stability. And,
and that's really what I'm looking
for as we optimize
our operations as we improve
our quality. I need
a financial model that allows
me to be sustainable long
term. Thank you, Mr
Chair. >> I'm gonna have
him bring a sheet of paper so
you can see what we're looking at
and I'm gonna go to Senator Pinto for a
question while you're, you're looking
at that Senator Pinto.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair members of
the committee and some of these might be
more comments than
questions. But
when we talk about certification
and entities coming in to
inspect our hospitals,
our our healthcare facilities,
that's just a snapshot in
time. Sometimes those
certifications, you know, they,
they get the place ready because they know
they're coming. And then
after that, that's it, everything
depletes and it's back to what
however they were doing
business and
that efficiency and that quality
of health care.
There are successful
hospitals. There are some
people out there who are
running these efficiently,
who want to do it that
way. But in
that sense too, this collapse
with R MC H seem like
there was nowhere for
our doctors
and people who work
there to turn because
there were issues with the
hospital and
nobody was listening
and they couldn't resolve
those. So they left.
So when our doctors come in and
those guys, you know, we say, yeah,
benefits and raise this
and put that money in there.
But a lot of it too, after
COVID was about the quality of
life that they really
work with these doctors in those
contracts have the flexibility
so that they're able
to, in some sense,
provide services to
several hospitals and
clinics because of their
specialties. And
that is, you know,
it's not like they don't want to work
out here or um
in these communities,
it's just that
there's no flexibility with
some of these people
running that. Um they
don't want to,
to really bring them in, in
that way. Um
And when we talk about the
reserves,
uh labeling
that money as reserves from
hospitals, that profit
money. Uh When
they say, well, we need money for
insurance.
You had all this money
to use to provide
that insurance costs to
pay for it. Um Even
the infrastructure, why
was not the money or the
profit reinvested
back into the hospital
if you knew you wanted
to pursue or
be able to provide to
community into perdu
perpetuity.
Um So they're just here for
that moment, fill
their pockets and then out the door,
it seems like
um
that's why even though
I haven't been in this capacity
for very long, but
that's more
of what I've seen.
Um Thank you, Mr chair members
of the committee.
>> If you want to respond to that, she
was just making comments, I
>> I'd be happy to
offer. So,
so the deal that we have as
far as our consulting
and advisory services
is a fixed monthly
payment. They don't get any
bonus, they don't get any
premium no matter
how we do, we lose money,
they don't get more, they don't get
less. Same thing. If
we make money as
far as compensating our
employees, including the medical
staff, we use
specific external
metrics to
make sure that we are at market.
So for the physicians,
we used MG MA
Medical Group Management
Association is an
established,
standardized
nationwide benchmark.
That's what we use. And
so when we hire a new doctor
in, we hire him at the 50th
percentile and
then we give them a year to establish
their practice. And then
we have a blended model. We
never put them entirely on
production, but a blended
model where they have a base
and then they get rewarded.
So just a
few weeks ago, we paid
100 and 65,000
in production related
bonuses to our medical
staff based on their
performance over the first quarter
of this year.
For our employees, we
try and be between
the 50th and the 75th
percentile. We want to
be a little bit above the
market because we
know that it's difficult to
recruit. Um
And, and so that's an area
where we're trying
to take care of our people,
including um
what you described as quality of
life. Um This
is a great place to live
if we don't let people have the time
to enjoy it, then they're
not going to stay
very long.
And then the last comment I would
make would be, um,
Senate Bill
161
actually creates
the expectation that we're going to
have 100 days cash.
So for us to be planning,
how we're going to save money
is consistent
with that specific
legislation. In
addition, it's always a balancing
act between how
much do you spend and how much
do you save? Um
I've had friends who
say it's the different perspective
between A CEO
and a CFO. A
CFO wants to hang on
to the money, the CEO wants
to spend it.
Um And so if
an organization is
stable, then
achieving that balance
of creating a, a
reserve because
you need to have the dollars for the
rainy day so that you don't
risk miss missing a
payroll, but
then you also have to invest
back into your organization.
And so I would
suggest that it's not in either
or each day. You
have to evaluate
where you are
and I'm
not to beat the dead horse, but Senate
Bill 17 positions
us completely
differently
than we have been in the
past. And then
Mr Chair specific commenters
to the line. So
I'm the 2022
net income must
have come from our financial
statements. We haven't filed
the 22 cost report
yet. That's one of
the areas where we are
deficient and we're working hard to
get caught
up.
And, and so the estimate
as far as the
amount we would get from Senate
Bill 17, I
would suggest that it's different
modeling. The numbers that I
referenced the
11 million came
from performance that
the Hospital Association had
created
>> Mr Chair if I may
clarify. So
um the
$6 million estimate
for Rehobeth mckinley
was based off of what
the new Mexico Hospital
Association gave us.
And so that
includes the 60
percent based on
Medicaid
eligible participants
coming into the hospital.
And then the other 40%
I calculated based off of
the ratio of how much
each hospital received
from the 60% to
estimate for
performance.
>> Different. Everybody's doing a little bit
different math. So,
so what I mean, we can
argue about it. Let's wait and see what
happens, right? I
mean, at the end of the
end of the day,
we're gonna put 1.3
billion into these hospitals and
I'm looking Eastern
New Mexico Medical Center,
which there's nothing wrong with
making a profit, right? But you're
$79 million
net positive,
right? And
you have other hospitals that are
struggling, but then we're
gonna give them an additional
$37
million. I
mean,
in, in a free world
market, you're gonna companies
and hedge funds which are the biggest
investors in, in the
economy today are
gonna start looking at these profitable
hospitals and they're going to
come in and they're gonna start buying
them saying
we got a 30 million $37
million net
clear every single
year that
we're gonna, we're gonna be able to
take back to our
investors. And so we
got to be cautionary as we move
forward as some of the smaller
hospitals are now gonna get bought
out by outside companies
and, and then they're gonna
roll their administration costs
up in a different model.
They're gonna show their net losses
and, and we're
gonna be drowning in
the same place we started from.
So that's really
17 has to be
really
watched on corporate
profit as we move
forward. I mean, for some of
the small rural hospitals,
it's, it's completely different. But
for the other one, it, it's gonna
be profit motivated,
which is the world
market. Let
me first say to you Bill. You
know what? Thank
you for helping us. Right? Because you
came from Taos,
Senator Gonzalez's district
and, and you were
saddled with a dead
horse
and you're trying to pump air in
him and get him alive and
get his feet moving at
least. But I mean, that,
that is a tough battle to take on
and I know sometimes
my temperatures get hot,
but I, I want to
clarify something that I I'm
hearing around town
that, that they
want to partner with IHS
and move the hospital out to the north,
right?
For people
in that need
services.
Partnering with a federal
hospital is going to be a tough
go.
Everything we talked about
prior, everything we're talking
about now, they will
not be eligible for any of
that money because the federal government,
we cannot make a transfer to the federal
government to subsidize
that. So in that
motivated
work and saying, oh, we want to move to the
hospital and partner with
IHS, we
have native Americans that come
to Rehobeth because they
don't want to go to IHS.
They have private health care
insurance. They have the
option to choose.
We have the ability to help
IHS when they close for
their water prom. So
that's a very cautionary
tale. I mean, you want to talk
about a completely ser different
service model that
will probably really put the nail
in the coffin
of, of people
wanting to go to
IHS Hospital and say I'm here
for my health care,
but I need to get referred to mental
health. They won't refer them
to the state agency. And so
that modeling just totally
tanks the whole, the
whole system when we partner with that.
I mean, it's a good idea but
really in, in, in
the, in the hospital
service industry, it
doesn't really work in a
community
if it did and we'd
see it all over the country. Go
ahead. >> Thank
you, Mr Chair. So I've actually
worked in this environment once
before when I was in Sitka
Alaska, I
was the CEO of the small
Community Hospital, Sitka Community
Hospital, which existed
because the
Indian Health Services
facility would
not provide a
consistent access
for the non
native
population.
And the last project
I worked on before I left, there
was trying to get the two hospitals
to work collaboratively.
That effort never came
to fruition. I'm
sad to report that my hospital
has now closed and the
only provider in that community
is the Indian health
services facility. Search
is the acronym. Um
I I would say from a
personal perspective,
bringing the two organizations
completely together
might be the ultimate dream,
but it also might well be a pipe
dream. What I would
suggest a starting point
would be is a lower
level collaboration of
services. So in the
meeting that I just had with my
medical staff, we were
talking about recruiting
and one of the specific specialties
was pediatricians.
And the question was,
could we at least
collaborate on a call
schedule? So
that that would mean that our
doctors wouldn't have to take as much
call. Their doctors
wouldn't have to take as much
call. So I'm
hopeful that the
collaboration that we were
able to demonstrate through the
water repair project
may well open some doors
for us. To have those conversations.
But I would agree with
you, Senator that the
idea of us
closing Raba
and completely
integrating with
GMC. That's
really a, a
big bet.
>> Yeah. And, and I
mean, our birthing center, we don't have
one. They go to grants
that collaboration would seem
to work
>> and we're planning to bring that back
next year >> and, and grants
is not even profitable with their
birthing center and that's getting the
shift to Galas patient. So, I
mean, I probably
know way too much about
that, but then I want to
know about arm seats. But I mean, this has
been a 20 year struggle.
I mean, we
know, I don't know if the board has ever
looked at the 5 million that
disappeared by the former
director. If we've got those charges,
I've been told one thing to
another. It's just,
it's a mess, but
I, I really want to thank
my colleagues, right?
And, and really, especially on
the on the Senate side,
right? When I talked to him
about saving the hospital that was
gonna be the, the,
the earmark hospital that
was gonna collapse in
December,
it was closing its doors, it
couldn't meet payroll, right?
The exec helped us
with agreeing to put the
12 million to keep them open,
right? And then
agreed with it to
help us put money
back in, to get you out of debt, to get
you to debt even. So these
numbers turn from red to
black, they may not
be large black numbers but they'll
be in the black. And
so my colleagues
really owe the gratitude because it's
just me as one
person asking them
or suggesting to them that
you really wanna see collapse,
you're gonna see a collapse in,
in one of the hardest hit
regions in, in COVID
in in.
And so my
applause goes to them and our
thankfulness for our
community should really go to them
and agree in helping us to
do that. I mean, if it
was a hospital and Representative
Armstrong, I would
do the same if it
was a hospital in center compost
district, which madam
secretary is still in need of help,
which we mentioned to you earlier
that we still haven't seen that
help for that hospital.
Um No matter
where it is, we're all in this
together
in, in front of our names is
state, whether
it's representative or
senator. So
as we reach out to communities and
go across the board, I think
you need to remember that
if his hospital needs help, let's
make sure they get help.
If her hospital
needs help, let's make sure they get
help because
um
I'm getting older
and I live closer to the Arizona
line and
it's shorter for me to go to
Arizona
and get better
health service than it is for
me to take the risk
on I 40 of a four
hour drive, a six hour
drive
and I know, I can be in
downtown Phoenix in four
hours. And so
those are options that I
have.
Um, but they're
not options for everyone.
But when
these other larger
hospitals, if we don't
save the rural hospital have been getting
tax, oh, it's
unfair for the rural hospitals to
get more money because
us, urban hospitals are paying
more well.
If we don't get the rural hospital
fixed, we're gonna be at your
hospitals knocking at your front
door, taking the services
out of your community,
either by a $70,000
airplane flight
or a two
hour trip to Albuquerque
or wherever it is across
the state to try to get those
services. So if we don't
fix the system
statewide,
you're just gonna get deeper
and deeper and deeper.
And so, I
mean, I really
kind of resent that
text. I mean, they're getting more money
than we're getting, but you're
gonna provide more services
to us and
people that travel
from Kado
or reserve
that have to make appointments to go
into Albuquerque that six
hour trip, round trip.
Right? And then
if you leave Gallup and you
never know what's gonna happen on I
40. You better
plan for 3 to 4 hours
before just
to make sure that you don't
get caught in traffic or
tied up in a wreck and then
come back and, and a lot
of people are driving their
parents and
back and forth. So, I mean,
that's why I think this really has
to be watched really
closely as we move forward
and that we
get the services we need
throughout the community. So
thanks for your presentation. I
think I'll take a Tylenol extra
strength
next time you come to the
room.
Uh But I appreciate your time,
Allegra, good job and
I appreciate your report bill. Thank
you for helping us again. I appreciate
that.
And now I
just,
I don't know where Jennifer went
to.
Didn't you
go?
Can you find
her?
Thank
you.
I just paid my goddamn property
taxes. Right. And
so we went in there and they said
we can't take checks. We're gonna
have to have cashier's checks. I'm
like, what?
Yeah, and it's like I had
like 47 property
tax bill. Like,
well, you
bounced a check and I said, oh
yeah, I bounced a check because they hacked
my, my account.
Right. And
I had to change account
numbers.
Thank you. We'll
be chatting, you
should chat with Gina a little bit
bill.
You should chat with
Gina. All
right. Chat with
her.
We charge for taking
pictures.
Well, we charge for taking pictures.
So
yeah,
on the other side of the,
of the
table.
Well, I don't know about that
yet because I just
paid property taxes last week
and it's like the vultures
are picking the bones every
single time. I, I don't
get much counting services, but
I pay a lot of counting taxes
and so
Uh,
Jennifer, you're gonna start us
off.
All right.
Yes.
>> As uh as we pick
those bones
clean,
>> this ain't, this ain't
KFC. It's not looking
good. So, go
ahead,
we're ready. Go
ahead,
>> chair, uh members of the committee.
Thank you so much for having me. My name
is Damian Lara. Uh
I am the
county assessor for
Bernalillo County. I am
also the
um New Mexico
Counties
Assessor's affiliate
chair and
thank you for having me
here today to speak a little
bit about
property taxes.
And more importantly,
the valuation and
assessment for
property tax
purposes
today. I'll just be
reviewing the
work of the county
assessors our
statutory responsibilities
as well as the
requirements
and one of the significant
hurdles faced
by uh county
assessors in, in
all 33 counties,
uh which is
um non-disclosure
uh of
um sales
information and transfers
in the State of New Mexico.
And then
discuss a little bit
about the
differences
between
what is
traditionally discussed
as disclosure
or full disclosure
and what the
county assessors
through
various
members of the state
legislature in
one way or form or
shape have brought
before the state legislature
probably for the past nine
years
or
more
which is what we've referring
to as equitable
disclosure.
Um And please,
um,
if you have questions, I,
I know we have some time reserved
at the end of the
presentation, but it is
very important
to have
a good understanding. And so
if you have questions
in between
what I'm discussing,
um, I, I would greatly
appreciate you interrupting
me and, and asking
those questions as well. I think
everybody has,
um, their
presentation. Um
We also sent it in
electronically,
um
very simply put the
county assessor is a
constitutionally
created
position.
We are
mandated by the
state
and only
have general
supervisory
oversight
by
taxation and revenue
department specifically,
the property tax division.
We also are
required to present
before each of our county
commissions for approval
of our planning assessments as
well as our budget.
Uh And we of course,
uh also report to
uh D fa local
governments uh in
the form of the budgets,
uh and the certification
of the assessments to do
that. So, um
while we are elected
officials, we do
have sort of three
oversight bodies um
that review our
work in a
nutshell.
We are responsible
for uh
identifying
ownership,
locating taxable
property and
assessing or basically
putting a value
on all taxable
property. Uh And there
is a whole wide range
of what that is.
Um We are
also in charge
of applying all of the,
what I like to refer to
as all of the tax savings
programs.
Um I and
for property tax purposes
as well. Do you
have? Oh,
ok.
So
very broadly
our responsibility,
um
we are mandated
by state statute
to as
the extent possible
have what we refer to as
current and correct
valuations of
all property taxes
or, or property
valuations.
Of course, there
are, as I mentioned, tax savings
programs, special methods of
valuations and
other um
special methods of valuation
that were required by law.
Um That is your
purview. Um As
far as what the tax savings programs
are, what the exemptions are
or how we
deviate
from
true current and correct.
Most of you may be familiar
with the 3% limitation
on increases. That
is one of the limitations
that exempts that
current and correct
when there is a transfer
or a change of ownership,
then we bring that property up
to the current and correct
valuation. One of
the other tax savings programs
that doesn't
allow us to go to current. Correct
is the valuation freeze
for senior
citizens
and people who are disabled,
um, that make a certain
amount, you know, at this year, it's
41,900
that is uh indexed
for inflation as well.
Um We can
talk a little bit about the veterans
uh constitutional amendments
that will be on the ballot and
a little bit further. But
those are some of
the limitations by
statute.
Generally,
we are mandated
by state statute for
everything else. And, and as
much as practical to
be at current and
correct.
Ideally that
is how ad
valore taxation
works. Um It is
not sort of income
tax or
gross receipts, sales tax
or sales taxes like that.
Um, in,
in the taxing world.
Um, that is
your sort of your three
legged stool that you talk about
income taxes,
sales or gross receipts,
taxes and
property taxes, which are
supposed to be an a valori.
So whatever the
value of the property
is, regardless
of who owns it,
regardless of, you know,
what circumstances are
there, that is sort
of the ideal or truly
pure
advi system
of taxation
by statute and by
generally accepted principles.
That's what we're trying to achieve
is this true
and correct? Fair market
value? You'll hear that a lot, some
of you who have purchased
property or
had exchanges,
you're typically looking
at fair market value. That
is what we refer to as
current and correct.
That is uh what
some fee appraisers or other
people tell you it's, you
know, a willing buyer
to a willing seller
without any duress or
undue influence.
We have three methods of
valuation that we are allowed to
use by state law.
One of them is just sort of the,
what I've discussed
the sales comparison
approach. What are
properties actually selling
for? We look
at the most similar and the most
comparable um we
do a sales ratio study,
sales ratios analysis
and that's how we assess that
valuation
there are hurdles to that as I'll
explain a little bit later.
The second one is the cost
approach typically,
what does it cost to replace
new less
depreciation?
Um You may see
that uh mostly
used by your insurance
companies uh
financing people
if my property
were to burn down,
what is it gonna cost me to
replace that new less
the depreciation held
over?
Do we have a question?
No. Um
And uh finally,
uh the income approach,
right? This is typically the
way that uh
investors or
business owners or
property for investment is
done. What is going to be my
return on the investment? How
much money
am I producing from this
property for leasing it
out or, or that
information? And we are
allowed to use that
um in one of your
handouts, um one
of the cut off
sentences that
uh is in N MS A
1978
section 7
36-15
in using all of these valuations
authorized by the
section, the
valuation authority
that is your county assessors
or for centrally assessed property,
property tax division
shall apply
generally accepted
appraisal techniques.
So we do have
industry standards that we have
to abide by. That
is part of our oversight for
property tax division that does
a yearly valuation on us that
we have to pass, we have to
take required courses.
Um You may remember that
I was here two years ago
saying we need to increase
sort of the incentive pay to
ensure that
myself as well
as all other appraisers
and assessors are
adequately trained in
generally accepted principles of
mass appraisal so that we can do our
job fairly and
accurately.
And we do have those standards
that we have to abide
by
all that to say
is that in New
Mexico,
we are typically referred
to as a non-disclosure
state. There
are some limit or
exceptions to that. We know sort of
sort of a limited disclosure
state because
when uh or
shortly thereafter,
the 3% limitation
on increases for residential
property was put in place.
I'm sure many
of you are familiar with the
limitation and then
what other people sort of discuss
is sort of tax lightning
when you decide to purchase
a new property or sort of
the welcome to the neighborhood tax,
all of that stuff,
residential property
is required
to file a sales
transfer affidavit
with your county
assessor.
That information
is confidential,
private and
exempt from
any public
records. Right. So
none of you
could
file an IP A
request and say, I'd like to
see all of the sales transfer
affidavits in my neighborhood.
No, you're, you're, that's
exempt you
as the legislature made
that determination. You
cannot get it except for very
limited circumstances.
I as the county assessor, as
well as any employee of
the office of the county
assessor will
be fired, cannot be
hired or for any government
job for a period of five
years and subject
to $1000 fine
as well as six months in
jail for
violating that
confidentiality rule.
Um So,
needless to say, we
take that very, very
seriously. Uh We
safeguard it. Other
employees of the county are
not allowed to view it
in my county as well as many
other counties. The safe uh
sort of best practices is
that, that is limited to
only the information that
is required, sort of on
a need to know basis
only. And
we can use that
to assess your property
by law. We are
only allowed to use that
for statistical and
analytical purposes,
which means that that's sort
of what we use to get an
idea if we are
doing our job correctly.
But I cannot say, well,
here I have this sales transfer
affidavit. So I know
that that's what your property is worth
because that's what it was purchased for.
What? Right, we cannot do
that very, very
different.
So what is the
norm in the
other 50 states
around the country?
Most all other
states have,
what is typically referred to
as full disclosure or
disclosures?
The sales price is
actually on the deeds.
Uh, it is disclosed
publicly.
Anyone is allowed
to get any of that
information if they
are willing to put in the work
for any property,
residential, non-residential,
industrial commercial,
anything else, uh,
fee appraisers can
look that up, can give you an
estimate, you can do
it yourself when you're
looking at property or investments
or anything. All
but 11
states,
uh and even some of these
11 states have kind
of like New Mexico does
some limited disclosure
of that sales property.
What that allows is typically
sort of another sort of
principle of
taxation policy, right?
Which is simplicity
and transparency.
At least when I used
to work for, uh, the
legislature, these
were um, principles
that were printed on every
uh, fir
policy, bills
and stuff and said these are the
guiding principles, uh
for taxation
policy. Those were the two
main ones that, that is
one of the things that,
um, as
well as uh for county assessors,
right? We, we do
that
in New Mexico
property owners would
either have to hire a realtor
or real estate agent or
some other person to help
them identify
what their valuation
is when they are
protesting. Um,
as well as
for commercial
property. And, and all of
that information
in New
Mexico,
non-residential
property
does not have the
same requirement.
So,
commercial property,
industrial property,
vacant land,
uh all of those uh
types of,
of real property
does not have to
disclose
um
what those sales
transfers uh are
are going for or what they're being
sold for.
Um So it really
ties the
hands of the county
assessors as far as
the sales comparison
approach. If, if we
don't know what property is being
sold for uh
or purchased for,
then we can't
use the sales comparison approach
so that I only leave sort of the other
two methods of valuation,
the income approach
or the cost valuation
approach. Um
As many of you
may be seen or heard
or from some of your
constituents, it
is no secret
that building
costs have
skyrocketed in the last
2 to 3 years,
right? Is that an accurate
representation of fair
market value? I
don't know because I
don't have that information,
at least in my county, I'm trying
to get it as much as we can.
But if all we're going off of
is what it costs to
build,
and we know that that is
increased, sort of
the only sort of remedy that
we have as county assessors
is to value the property
at what we have. Right?
Property owner then that is
a business owner or
commercial or industrial
or all that kind of stuff will then come in
and say, well,
uh, yeah,
that might be what it would cost to build
it new now. But are you taking into
account depreciation? Yes,
we are. Oh, well, but
this is that, well, if
we can't come up to noon, then they'll
typically come in and say, well,
this is what a lease
rate would be or this is the income
approach to do that.
So we would have to work some of
those things out
from our perspective
as county assessors,
um
the solution to some of these
issues and problems would
be that we
hold non-residential
property owners to
the exact same
standard that we
hold residential property
owners, which is to
require them to
file a
sales transfer
affidavit with their
county assessor that is
completely confidential, that
is not going to be shared
with anybody that is not public
and that has severe
consequences if that is
not followed to the
law that
would allow us as
county assessors as appraisers
to determine for statistical
and analytical purposes
only if we
are doing a good job
at getting at current and correct
valuations.
Um And,
and you know that
bill
um
for
many, many years has been
brought up by county assessors
in one shape or form
in, in in various
years, uh, throughout
the, and for whatever
reason, has just not been able
to, to get moving
forward. And I
understand sort of the,
some of the sentiment,
right. If my value
goes up, then
that means my taxes go
up. Um,
and, and it's probably no secret
that in many
counties,
non-residential property
is significantly undervalued
because there, there isn't a good
way to figure
that out and the people
who know that their value
is much higher than what
we're assessing them for
simply don't come to
protest. Only
people that
protest are people who
know that their value is
lower than what their assessment
is for. And so that's the information
that is provided, right?
So your county assessor
tries to find out information
in other ways. One
of those ways is through the protest
process when property owners come
in and share information that they
have. Another way
is that we send out questionnaires
and ask for this information,
whether that's income
sales or
any other sort of stuff. We also
subscribe
to a host
of
subscriptions,
right? Um to try
and get this information. So it's an
added cost for
county assessors um
to purchase subscriptions.
Um There's many
um and I can, you
know whether it's costar
Moody's or any of these
other subscription
purchases that provide
information. But again, that is
also information that is
provided by the property
owners through them and
then comes back to
us.
I I also just want to
make a a good
distinction because
there are a lot of
stakeholders in, in
this
industry
and
particularly on the commercial
side, right? You have
commercial realtors
Um, and, and I'm sure
some of you may have seen the
news about,
you know, realtors and
settlements about what it
is that they're providing for
services and, and
changing for that. And,
and I don't necessarily need to get
into that
this sort
of what, what has been presented
in the past and what
county assessors typically
refer to as equitable
disclosure is not
that we,
we don't, I mean,
we don't take a position one way or
another that that is for you guys
to do that. What all we're asking
for is a or all that
we're defining as
what is referred to as equitable
disclosure is just
that to, to treat
residential property
owners and non-residential
property owners
equitably
fairly
and the same right
there there, in our view, there
really shouldn't be a difference between
those two types
of property owners.
Um
The other
issue on, on
taxation, you know, at the end
of the day, that that is what's
going to happen, right?
Um
Yield control formula and I won't
get into yield control formula,
but yield control formula,
if you think of it as
a seesaw, right? Or
Teeter Totter or whatever,
you're wherever you're from,
whatever the dialect is,
right, yield control
formula also put in by state
statute for yourselves
as values go up.
That means that
the tax rate, the mill
rate that all of the various
taxing authorities have
has to go down
so that the taxing authorities
the counties, the cities and everybody
else
only receives
tax
payments for
roughly the same as it was
last year. Right.
Absent
the need for new construction
or new roads, new
fire substations, new
police substations,
uh wastewater
facilities.
It shouldn't take
local governments, cities,
counties,
soil and water districts,
more money
to do the same job that they were
doing in previous
years. Right. So
yield control formula is supposed
to stop that. So if you have a 15
or 20%
appreciation in the housing
market as you often do,
then that means that you should
lower the
assessments by
approximately the
same
and, and, and
on mass that
typically will work.
Um DFA
also has some
leniency for
inflation and they can put up
to a 5% increase on that.
And, but again, I'm, I'm not going
to get into that.
So really if we
do this correctly and we do
this on mass
your taxes as a
property owner, whether
residential or non-residential
shouldn't go up
just because the value goes
up. And that's really
what, what we're trying to
do,
as mentioned earlier. There are
some exceptions to that,
right? Um
People on valuation
freeze and
other tax savings
programs.
Um and, and Jennifer can
correct me if I'm wrong, but it is
my understanding that
22
of the counties
in the State of New
Mexico
are maxed out on their
mill rates.
So they will no longer
be able to increase
their mial rate for
further operations.
The reason I bring this
up is because
if both of the
constitutional amendments
are passed,
that means that
that tax burden
will have to be shifted
to other property
owners again as
county assessors,
we do not take a position
one way or the other.
You know, as I used to say,
when I was a draft
attorney attorney for,
for rest, you know,
I, I, I'm neither here to
support nor
right. You guys have all heard that
and, and that's the same thing here,
but it is our responsibility
to kind of tell you
what the consequences
of some of this stuff
will be.
It is almost impossible
to approximate
or make assumptions on
the number of
disabled veterans in the
state of New Mexico. Um
Veterans services will probably
have a better idea uh
of that.
Um, anecdotally,
we've heard that almost
every single veteran that
leaves the services
has some type of hearing
loss that will give them a
10%
disability
or, or something of that
type, right? But again,
we don't know that's anecdotally.
There, there is no hard data one
way or another. So I cannot
give you a good guessimate
on what that valuation would
be or what that tax
revenue would end up
being. What
I can tell you
is that
in the county of
Bernalillo,
we have
22,000
veterans who are
currently receiving a
$4000
exemption of the
taxable value
that roughly translates
to
$3.8
million
in taxes that
are not being paid
by the veterans as a
whole. Um, that are
not going to the counties,
city school
boards,
hospitals,
uh soil and water districts,
all of that
stuff.
Not that much in the grand
scheme of things. That's
3.8
million
if we were
to pass the constitutional
amendment and
that goes from 4000
to
$10,000
that's
$221
million of valuation
that would be reduced,
which translates
to
an additional
$5.6
million for a total of
$9.5
million worth of
taxes
for counties
that don't have additional mill
rate leverage or who
are maxed out. That means
that the
little old lady on value
freeze
whose value isn't gonna go
up,
her
assessment is probably gonna have
to go up or her
tax rate is probably
gonna have to go up because that has
to be made up somewhere else,
right? So
we just need to have a better
handle on that.
If you
include
that these 22,000
veterans are
gonna have some sort of
disability in addition to
the percentage of that,
then that will very
quickly
with that.
I
yield Mr Chair
for
questions
Jennifer. Are you making a >> presentation?
Yes, Mr Chair.
So just to introduce myself,
Jennifer Fabian, I'll
go um quickly through my
brief. It's um on Tab
K, I believe in your packet
and then we will open up her questions. I'll
try to leave plenty of time. I'm
an economist with the
LFC. Love to end the
day on taxes.
So I took an
allergy pill ready to
go. Um So
I'm gonna take a much higher
view um
than Asess or Lara did and
try to give you all a really good background
on property taxes,
how it's structured, how that
structure has
um some implications in the
policy world and some
reform options that might be available
to you all.
Um Firstly, I just want to talk about why
we're talking about property taxes
as, as a Lara hit it on the head.
It's one of the three
legs of the stool that a New
Mexican will pay throughout their
lifetime. Um
along with G RT and personal
income tax.
Additionally, um New
Mexico has become a bit of an outlier
in terms of having very low property
taxes. So just like to kind
of um keep us in
context. Um
property taxes are often
used in comparisons
between states for businesses,
for people moving here, rankings,
stuff like that. Um
And while it is a local revenue
issue, the entire property
tax code sits within the state.
Um So really
want to have a good handle on it. Want to
make sure that you all as state
legislators um have a good
handle on it. So
I'm gonna go very quickly. So
bear with me.
Um, first off,
I just wanna put
out there, the total property tax
revenues in 2023
grew to two or to
$3.3 billion
across the state. That's
a 60% growth over
2021. So we've
seen some really massive growth in
property tax revenue
in the last couple of years. I'll
talk about what's driving that in a, a little
bit. Um 30%
of that revenue goes to county
governments, about 14
to municipal governments,
33% to school
districts, 10%
to higher education and the remaining
13% to hospitals and
state debt service. I'm not
gonna talk a lot about state debt service
today. We can
have more hearings on that a little bit later,
but we do leverage
1.36 mils
for as long as I can
find in the data that we've leveraged
1.36 mils for
state general obligation
bonds.
Um I'm gonna
talk a lot about mills throughout this
conversation. Um So
I just wanna
kind of educate everybody on what a mill
is. So if taxes
aren't confusing enough, we have a
new vocabulary just for property
taxes. Um
A mil is a dollar of taxation
on every $1000 of
property value. So it's 1/10
of a percent. If that's helpful,
20 mils is $20
on $1000 of taxable
value if that's helpful to
you. Um
The constitution since
1933
has limited the amount of
operational mills that can be levied
across governments to
20 mills.
So there's a hard cap in the
constitution at 20 mills for
operating. That's for
basically ongoing budgets.
Since 1980 the
state has given all of those
mills back to
locals. So
the constitution sets the limit.
State statute sets the
distribution who gets
what mills since
1986 it's
been 11.85 mills
for counties, 7.65
mills for MU and a half a
mil for school
districts. So there's that
hard cap. Um You
all get to decide who gets which
mills that hasn't been
changed in a very long
time.
So in addition to mill levies
for operations, local
government school districts
can levy mills for debt and
special projects.
Um These have to be approved by the
voters. These are the ones that will be on a
local ballot.
Um They're often
for capital projects that
don't go through the traditional capital L A
process. They're funded through
property taxes. Um
But they can also be these special
districts like a community
college district, a higher
education district, sometimes our
conservation districts for
water, stuff like
that. Um
With all of these different kind of
districts overlying on top of
each other. Um There's
about 240
distinct tax districts in
the state. So depending
on where you live, you
might have multiple of those districts
kind of sitting on top of one
another. Um And you can
see on the top of page two,
kind of the weighted mill rate
with all those different mills imposed
across counties.
The highest mill rate I found for
residential property was in
Albuquerque. Um
5 55.8
mils um
for a district down Kirie
that had multiple of those special
um mills kind of on top
of their operating mills.
Um and the lowest I found was
10.8 mils for a rural
tax district in Chavez
County. Um
On average, it ranges
between 46.6 mils
in Bernalillo County. Um
All the way down to 18.5
mils in Kron
County.
Um On average,
I want to point out that these special
mills can have a drastic
impact on someone's
tax bill. So on
average across counties in 20
23/50
percent of the tax levied was
for special
districts.
Um only
41.9% for
operating budgets. Uh
2.6%
for debt, local debt
service and 5%
for state debt service.
So on the bottom of page two,
you can see um
some examples of how these mills
might stack up. You'll see
Bernalillo County um
has more special mills than some
places have total mills.
Um They like to stack these
kind of special districts on top of each
other. Um
Catron County has a lot of
county operating mills.
You'll see Santa Fe has more county
debt than most. Um
Los Alamos has more
um, county
operating.
So that's just let me point out
every, I have the breakdown of every
counties mills in the back
in Appendix. A if you want to look
up um where you're
from.
So moving on, let's talk about what's
getting taxed under the property
tax. So in a
box on page
two in the middle, you
can see residential property
tax, residential properties
are 42% of the tax
base. Non-residential
properties are 21
and oil and gas, which is
an ad valorem tax is
37%. So
we tax these three different things.
The oil and gas tax is
a severance tax. It's
based on the price and production
of, of oil produced
on that land. And the
kind of reasoning
behind is that the value
of that land is not just the
land and the structure upon it, which
is how you do other properties.
It's the value of the oil that's coming out
of that land. So we do the
severance tax basically,
instead of property tax,
it's reported along the same
because it's instead of property
taxes. And I
want to point out that 37%
is really, really, really
high. Um, it's
not, it's not an economist
presentation unless we talk about oil and gas
volatility. So,
oil and gas, traditionally, since
1986
through about
2018, fluctuated
between eight and 15%
of the property tax values
across the state. We're
up to 37%.
Now, since
2018,
it's grown over
526%.
So a huge growth in oil and
gas. That's really what's
driving these
increased of taxable values,
this increase of revenues that we've seen in
the last couple of years. And
you can see that on page
three at the
top, you'll see residential,
non-residential oil and gas in
total. And you'll see oil
and gas since 2020 is really
what's pulling up total
taxable value in the
state.
And really, we're talking about 13
counties that have oil, any
oil and gas and really, it's Eddie
and Lee that's driving most of
this, um, 75
78% of taxable
value um in
Eddie County and 87%
in Lee's oil and gas. So
I just want to point that out that there's
this very volatile revenue
source. Um, that is kind of
the, the bedrock of their property
tax system.
Um It also
injects some volatility into
our state general
obligation bonds as
well.
Um Again, on page three, you
can see the net tax of value
growth over 2018,
Eddie and Lee's way up their
400% massive
growth in those counties. They're
pulling up other oil and gas counties
while the rest is kind of hovering around
22%.
Um On page three, the brief
hits on um kind
of what it says a lot I was
talking about with residential and
non-residential properties. Kind
of how that share of the tax
base has been shifting over
time. So since
1987
non-residential properties have
fallen behind residential properties
used to be about 5050.
And prior to 1987
non-residential properties were
actually the core of the tax
base in the state.
Um You can see on the bottom of page
three that graph,
um, residential properties are
now kind of bearing the
brunt. A lot of that tax
burden has shifted to homeowners
versus industry versus
non-residential. So it's a
trend that we're seeing over time
causes might be that,
you know, valuations have
lagged in the commercial industry.
Um More
likely it's this undervaluation
um of those properties.
So I won't go into more detail. He covered
it in detail. So,
um we'll have questions on
that, I'm sure.
Ok. Moving on to the bottom
of page let's
talk about growth controls.
So again, Cesar
Lado mentioned a couple of them
nationally, states use a combination
of three things to limit runaway
property taxes. The
first is that mill
limit that 20%
cap that we have for oat
operating. You can't
tax more than this amount.
That one's pretty straightforward. We
have one. However, it does not
apply to special districts
or to debt mills. So it
only caps operating mills.
So it is limited in what
um its impact can
be. The
second one is the assessment limit.
The 3% growth of your
assessed value of residential
properties only can only grow
by 3% a year
that um valuation
resets when you sell a
property. And
the third one is yield control.
The most complicated part. It's
never called yield control and statute.
That's just a term the
industry came up with. Um
but basically what it is,
it's a revenue cap.
So any tax
district, it's counties
and means primarily
um can only grow
revenues by
the inflation factor. The
inflation factor is determined
by D fa it's tied
to um a
Bureau of Labor statistics,
inflation of government
services. So basically they
determine how much government
services the cost to
run a government has increased
and they can only grow their revenues by
that amount if
their taxable value grows,
if they've done a lot of
turnover and a lot of homes have been
brought up to value or just values have
skyrocketed like we've seen the last
couple of years.
D fa says, well,
it only has
it, the cost to
run a business has only gone up
4%. So you can only
grow your revenue by 4%.
So even though values have gone
up and you would expect your tax
bill to increase. As
he said, the teeter totter effect
comes into play. So they
say you can only grow your revenues by
4%. So everybody's tax
rate goes down.
That's kind of how
yield, yeah, ideally
that's how yield control
works. And that's
really on the revenue side.
So we're one of only nine
states that implement all three of
these things at the same
time and it can have
some kind of funny effects on
the tax rate. So
the first is
um
the assessment limit.
So what that does
is it kind of creates
um an
inequality throughout
tax districts based solely
on how long you've lived
in your home.
So I'm gonna move
kind of forward a
little bit to page
five and talk about the
impacts of assessment
limits.
So first time homebuyers,
young homeowners, they tend to
have more churn, they buy a
starter home, then they have a
baby and they want upsize
and they're trying to grow or they're moving,
they're finding a new job, they're finding a
new opportunity.
And every time they sell
their assessed value,
resets to current and
correct as close as the assessors
can get it, um, to
current and correct longer
term homeowners get to reap
this benefit of this 3%
cap year after year after year
after year. And it has no
real targeted
approach to the
ability to pay the income
of those residences, the value
of those homes, whether
they're New Mexicans
or someone from outside who owns a
second home, it applies to
everybody. Um,
and it's really just not the most
targeted approach to
keeping property taxes down
for those who can't afford to
pay. Um,
the point of assessment limits is to
keep Santa Fe loves to talk about
the little old lady on Canyon road.
Canyon Road is the most expensive
road in the state.
Um, but there are people that live there
that have owned the home for a very, very long
time and bought it when it was very
affordable and it was a local
street. Um, now it's this
gallery street, it's worth a lot of
money and they might be priced
out very quickly,
gentrifying neighborhoods have this
problem. Um,
but there are more targeted ways and I'll get
to those a little bit later that don't
benefit out of
state homeowners
that have second homes that aren't
benefiting long term
landlords that own
a property for a really long time.
Um, and are reaping the benefit of
this year, over year, over
year.
Um, the other thing
that assessment limits
kind of
cause is a lock
in effect. So this
is when, um,
people feel kind of trapped in their home
because if they were to move, even to
downsides, even to get a
cheaper home, they're gonna
be hit with a higher tax
bill. Um,
this keeps supply
low. It keeps that kind of
turn on the housing market
from being really robust
and it, it could increase prices
in the long run and, and kind of
contribute to our affordable housing
crisis because supply is a
little bit stagnated.
It's kind of locked in.
Um, on page
six, I did an analysis
county by county
on a home that was purchased
in 2010, 13 years
ago. That's the average
duration of a homeowner in New
Mexico 13 years.
Um, so if I took 13
years and did
an analysis of the,
the growth in home prices
in each county, how
much somebody who bought their home
then versus somebody who's buying their
home today, the tax
difference, um, between
those two people on average
across the state, it's
25%.
So if you bought a home 13 years ago,
you're saving about 13% in your
tax bill to someone buying the
exact same home today.
Um, it varies.
Roosevelt Lee mckinley, those are
all, um,
6 11% 12%
16%. But you look at
Luna Lincoln, Los Alamos
and Sierra, huge,
huge differences between the
assessed kind of
limited value and
the value at, um,
current and
42% in Sierra
County. 40% in Los
Alamos. Those are places that
have seen rapid appreciation over
the last 13 years. So
those assessment limits are
really, really protecting
those long term homeowners
at the expense of newer
homeowners. People trying to move in now,
people trying to buy their first
home.
Um, moving on
to yield control.
Oh, before I move on, I wanted
to do a quick just
evaluation. Basically,
if two neighbors
with identical incomes,
identical houses
value the exact same.
Um, they both have a wife,
two kids and a dog,
um, a picket fence,
identical neighbors if
one bought their home 13 years
ago at the median
and the two homes are worth the
median. Now, the one
homeowner who bought their house
today versus the one that
bought it 20 years ago
is paying $2000
more in taxes each
year than their identical neighbor.
Again, assessment limits don't
have any exacting
measure of income ability
to pay, um, or
if you're a resident or
not.
So, moving on to yield control.
Um, Assessor Lauda mentioned this,
it basically hamstrings local
governments from raising revenue.
Um So two thirds
of counties have implemented all of
their mills that they're allowed all
11.885.
Sorry, I almost forgot what the mill
rate was. Um
Yield control has suppressed
county mills on average
by 3.3 mills
um in 2023 and in
municipal bills by
1.2. Um
this is a revenue losses
of 100 and 52 million
for counties and 34 million
for cities. Um
You can see
where do I have
that? It's a
little bit earlier in your
brief. It's on page
four.
This is kind of the difference between
what they've imposed what
those city councils and county
commissioners commissioners have
voted to impose versus
the yield control rate.
So, Catch and Curry and Torrance County
are able to implement all the mills that they've
approved. But places
like San Miguel County, Rio
Ribo, Santa Fe and Lincoln
have over half of their
mills have been stifled by
yield control. So
they're only allowed to tax
half the mills that they've approved.
Um So pretty big impacts
um there, especially in
light of the, the housing growth that we've
seen.
Um On page seven,
there's a little exercise
here. Um It
has the home value growth. This is actual
statewide home value
sales growth in
the first column. The second column
is the yield control growth factor
that DF used um
since 2003
and then it basically just takes
a hypothetical $400,000
home at 20 mils and calculates
the savings from yield
control and assessment limits on that
home throughout those 20
years. So you can
see there's a
savings while the
yield control is tamping
down growth.
And then actually after the,
after the housing bubble
burst back in 2008,
2009, you can actually
see that yield control increase
taxes um
on some people on some
folks and the assessment
limits, they caught up. So
with that 3% cap, they actually
caught up to current correct values
for a couple of years
um there after
2013 through
2016, but then
with the housing growth we've seen since
then, they're saving almost
$1500 a year, even
just in the last five
years.
>> I do want to mention that
myself and Clyde Ward,
who some of you may still remember
was a former
assessor for.
Um
so uh San
Juan and was the president for
the counties.
We did bring a
bill in 2015
to say.
Now is the time
if you're ever gonna do it state
legislature to
fix the 3% cap
now is the time
because
we're there, right?
The, the, the, the
valuations and fair
market value
are in this sort
of sweet spot
um
in, in its infinite wisdom
that state legislature said
no,
it is.
But
>> ok, I'm gonna quickly
wrap with some
options we have for tax
relief, maybe some reform
within the property tax
um realm. So
while these broad and overreaching growth
controls are effective, they're
very effective at limiting property
tax growth. They don't
target those most in need.
They shift tax burdens
away from appreciating
properties towards lower
appreciating properties. They
hamper local governments taxing
authority and there are other
forms of more targeted tax
relief um,
the better alleviate undue property
tax burdens for those in need
without creating these horizontal
tax inequities just
based on how long you've owned a
home. Um, and New
Mexico has kind of a head start on
some of these. Um, but they're
ineffective and I'll, I'll go through that.
Now,
a,
the first is a homestead
preferential treatment. So
homestead is basically an owner
occupied primary residence.
You own the home and you live
in the home, not a second home, it's
not an investment property. It's not an
airbnb. Um
It's where you live.
Um Most states have this,
they have some form of
preferential treatment for people
that live in the state.
Um Oftentimes
it's a lower rate more often
it's an exemption off of the
taxable value. New Mexico
has one. It's $2000
off the taxable value.
That's a tax savings of less than
$100 for most people.
It's very, very small.
It, it doesn't,
it doesn't do much to differentiate
between second homeowners
and primary residences from
New Mexicans, from the person that
has a second home and ta
um
There's more we could do here.
Um I ran an
example on page nine,
if you raise that head
of household exemption to
$30,000
for all owner occupied
primary residences,
net taxable value across the state
would decrease by about $8
billion. So we would take
all of that taxable value away.
Um, mill
levies because of yield control would
have to increase.
So mills would probably
go up by about 7.3
mils for everybody.
And so what this does is it
actually creates
kind of this seesaw effect
where your assessment
goes down by $30,000
but your mill rate goes up and
this really, really benefits
lower income households, this
benefits lower priced homes
more than it does higher income
ones. And so as an
example, at
the statewide median, it's
about a net neutral. They might
see $100 increase in their
tax bill up a little
bit higher up to the 4
$415,000
home. They're gonna see
a completely net neutral
um, tax
situation. Their, their assessment
goes down but their mails on the rest of
their property goes up.
Um, for someone who has a
$200,000 home, a
starter home, they would
save 30% of their tax
bill with a structure like
this. Someone with a
$600,000 home above
the median home price in New
Mexico would see about a
7% increase.
So they see a little bit of a tax increase
less than $500 400
dollars a year. Um,
but it really helps the
low income shifts it to the higher
income, the higher ticketed
homes,
there was another version of a homestead
provision introduced in house bill
71 in the 2022
regular session and
this was to increase that
3% assessment limit
on non primary owners
to 10%. So it
allows those properties to kind of
catch up faster
and come up to fair market
value for non primary
homes a little bit faster.
Um But it did not
pass
the last kind
of real targeted
approach that states us is called
circuit breakers. And
what this does is
it limits your property tax
to a threshold of your income.
So it says nobody should
pay more than 3% of their income
to property taxes.
Once you hit that level,
then you're done paying
basically. And with the yield
control, it might shift to people who
can't afford to pay.
Um We have some version of this.
It's very small, it's
only for low income, elderly
folk. Um
and it's limited to those who have
less than $16,000 of income
a year that's not indexed to inflation.
So people have been graduating out of
this program over time.
Um Circuit Breakers have many
benefits over broader tax
policy relief and primarily
it's that it can be targeted at
certain income groups.
We often give tax breaks
for in property for
people who are low income and
so low income and disabled,
low income and veteran, low income
and elderly.
Um But we have low-income folks
that need the help, who might not be
elderly, who might not be
disabled. Um
So we can broaden those a little
bit
um just to hit on, um, some
revenue stability
issues. So,
unlike severance taxes, personal
income tax, groce receipts taxes,
property taxes are least
affected by recessions and
swings in oil and gas.
Um, there's more and more
reliance on oil and gas, especially in those
13 counties. Um,
but primarily Eddie and Lee.
Um, but even
though the
kind of ad volum,
oil and gas taxes have
swung from 35
100 and 35% growth
year over year down to 44%
declines. Property taxes
have never changed more than
22%. So
it's fairly, pretty stable,
those residential
non-residential uh property
tax revenues offset the oil and
gas swings.
Um Our state has very low
reliance on property tax.
Our municipalities and
counties rely much less
on it than
nationwide and there's
some opportunity to shift
some of this tax reliance
um to
property taxes from
less regressive or more
regressive and possibly more volatile
revenues like G RT.
So, you know, municipalities that
are in counties that are very reliant on
G RT and get hit every
time there's a recession, maybe
they can give up an increment
tax a little bit more with
property and be able to kind
of balance and have more stability in
the long run.
Um In some, there's
a couple avenues the
legislature could take the
first is enacting full or
partial disclosure for non-residential
properties, help balance
that tax burden a little bit
more, um
expand these targeted tax
release the homestead exemption, Circuit
Breakers primarily.
Um And then if you do those two
things, the homestead exemption and
the Circuit Breakers, you could
repeal assessment limits as
well without
hurting the low income, the middle
income folk making sure
there's limits on how much you can pay
of your income. Um,
but still be exporting
a lot of that tax to your second
homeowners, your out of state,
um, taxpayers
through the property tax.
Um, but still protect
your new Mexican citizens in
your district. Um,
so I'll stop there. I know
there's got to be questions. I want to
make sure you leave plenty of time.
So thank you, Mr Chair.
>> Oh, you gave me a bunch of
ideas.
I'm gonna give my, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna give my house to this
little old lady, so I don't have
to pay taxes and then I have
her give it back to me in her
will and, and
that will cap it or I put it in a
trust and you
never see the transfer
represent Lujan. You
first.
>> Um Thank you Mr Chair
II. I appreciate this is,
it's really, you really
gotten to the weeds with this. I, I've been
talking to you about property
taxes over the
last four
years, I guess and,
um, are just
finding, you know, equitable
ways of, for
affordable housing. Uh
being from Santa Fe
County, um,
and the city of Santa Fe where we
have and by
some of your documentation, some of the
highest
um
um of
housing.
So, I mean, I like
to see a tax on, on
and, and people coming in from
out of state and buying up our
housing uh paying
in cash. I
think that these are some of the things.
And so I understand why
the historical value,
what you didn't include
here is the political will
of getting these sort of
reforms done. I think
that you're, you make a lot of sense in
what you're talking about.
And I, you know,
in, in my district
particularly I have
part of a historical district
called Dawa Fria.
And there we have
a very long term, a long
established
community
and to
ask them to
have increases when they have
some of the lowest incomes
and when we don't have any other place
to build in my district alone,
Mr Chair, I had, I think
the second highest growth
um in the
state
with a 4%
growth
and
that's where we're seeing some of these affordable
housing complexes.
I'll call them um
being
um built. I
have a problem and I think you, you
said the word and you said
gentrification,
it's something we are not even talking
about. It's something we're not even dealing
with. I would like to see
um in some of the reporting and
some of some of the this data,
what that gentrification has
done, what it looks like and why we
do, why we establish
that those caps in that
3% because
I can tell you from my own
community and from my,
from my knowledge and, and I
believe it was uh Mr
Mr Chair Lucky
Varela, who's, who
was in my seat uh
prior to me
and um
then speaker Benry
Lujan, who implemented
some of these, these
um these tax caps
and, and policies
because our
communities were being
gentrified and not
necessarily in a good way
because that when we look at
gentrification, there, there are
benefits to where we change
things and, and improve
things. But
Mr Chair, I, I'd like to just
enter this fact too in Santa
Fe.
Um there is a
um
a report that I read that
are we're looking
at market rate values and, and
those sorts of things and making those
comparisons.
It's not across the
board.
Um There's, there is inequity
in it and
um right now in Santa
Fe in a rental
unit, you're gonna pay the
same, same amount of uh
that you're paying in Los Angeles,
California in Los
Angeles, in Orange
County.
That's ridiculous
when we look at what, what is
going on there. So I
really appreciate what you're doing when you're
looking at the equitable uh savings
and how well we move into
different and more precip
uh tax
codes. I think you,
you have pretty much created a
tax package
right here if we're
gonna continue to have a tax
package. Um I like
some of these ideas but I'm also very
protective and very cautious,
cautious about some
of these changes, especially for our
elderly and established
communities in our families.
And I think that if we don't
give them some promises and give
them some education and
explanations, assessors
offices,
um we're not gonna be able to
move into these types of
quality um
reforms.
Um
And to put, put, put
it on the ballot, what we've done
in this current tax package
and now what we're seeing, what we're going to be voting
on again,
it's the education
that, that we don't, that the
taxpayers don't really
understand. Um I
could get into further
conversation in depth in this,
but I just want to give some, some
added explanation
and information of how we got
here and
who it was protecting and who it
continues to protect and who
I will continue to protect.
And I think most of us here too will
continue to protect those, those
established communities
and those that cannot
afford to,
to buy their own home myself
included Mr Chair.
If I didn't have a
family property, family
housing, I wouldn't be able
to live in Santa Fe
counties. And
that's just a fact. I
don't know that we
are really principled in how
we, how we're
dealing with this issue in a
holistic way. Other, I mean, this is
one part of it, this is one part of
the, the, the pie
we're looking at the taxes. I think
it's it's adequate,
but we're not looking at all
these other um,
other effects
and what
are some of the consequences, Mr
Chair if you, if we didn't, if
we didn't, um, if we
decided to move on some of your
principled policies
and we say we did your whole,
we only took part of
it. How
will we still be,
um, how
could that in effect
hurt our taxpayers?
Mr
Chair,
>> Mr Chair Representative Lujan.
you are 100% correct.
I would not advocate for repealing
assessment limits without
stacking them with these
homestead exemptions or
circuit breakers. So a
circuit breaker would protect
somebody who
basically their home has appreciated
so much that they can no longer afford
their property taxes. It would put
a cap on that based on their
income. Um,
and that helps fixed income folks too.
People that incomes who,
you know, people who are in social security that
aren't able to, to grow their
income year every year, it would help
do that.
Um
If you just repealed assessment limits
tomorrow, everyone would see tax
lighting that has owned their home more than a
year. Um So
we wouldn't want to do that. It would have
to be layered, use those
savings from repealing assessment
limits to target
those people that actually need help
paying for those property
taxes. >> Mr
Chair. So, is this something that we could
do in this next session
and like
a full implementation,
right of, of some of these
reforms and
have the capacity with tax
and rev to support
this Mr
Chair,
>> Mr Chair Representative Lujan. I
can't answer that question for, for Tex
and rev. Um We
could certainly draft legislation by the
next session. I think there
should be some conversation with
county assessors gets a little bit
more data um
because these might hit different communities
differently. People that have
um really high values over
time, those assessment limits and those
yield controls have
kind of tamped it down those
property taxes more than, than
somewhere else. Um So
there needs to be a little bit more,
more work on it,
um
for sure, but it is possible
there is, there's
certainly possibility to these things.
A lot of these, if you keep yield
control are revenue
neutral. Um
because you would basically
take something out of the tax base, yield
control would kind of
increase to, to kind
of shift those taxes to
those um who can
pay them. Um So
it's kind of view control works in that way
to kind of help keep
local governments whole
through some of these. We're, we're trying
not trying to hurt the, the mean in
the counties here. >> Thank
you that, that answered my, my
next question. Thank you so much, Mr
Speaker. I mean Mr Chair, I
appreciate the time
>> mister chair representative.
May I interject?
So the
in my
view,
the good thing about
property taxes is that
you don't rely
on tax and
rev to implement
it. So
it would be a matter of whether
or not your
individual counties,
county assessor's office
are equipped to
handle
the transition. There
are things that again,
you know, I'll, I'll refer back
to
the principles of taxation.
Right. Simplicity.
It would be one of those
things
and sort of measured
methodical stuff
is, is a little bit
easier to do
than
circuit breakers. And,
and, and, you know,
can we as a
county assessors? I, I can almost
guarantee you that all 33 counties
assessors can go
from
$2000
head of family
exemption.
Right. I would
say maybe $10,000
exemption if, if you want to do
30,000. That, that again, that's
all up to you. But, um,
but that, that also indicates
some of the things that,
um, you know, was brought
up. Right. So
your veteran who
is the primary homeowner is the
primary residence can
stack that right?
$10,000 for
their veteran
exemption. $10,000
for the head of a family exemption
and, and all that kind of stuff.
Um, can we
as county assessors
determine,
um, income?
No, that's going to be
very difficult. Right. How
do we as county assessors
identify
pits,
pits are based off of your federal
income taxes which as many
of, you know, by
federal are prohibited to be
shared except for very
specific stuff. So
even the programs that
we have now the, the
local option for counties
to refund
property taxes based
on income taxes is
almost never used
because we don't have that
information.
The constitution, if I remember
correctly, um, has
already a limitation.
Um, you're allowed to
set as a state legislature.
So again, remember
everything property
tax related
has its basis in the
constitution. The
constitution gives the legislature
limited authority
to do things on the
tax side of things. That's
why we have two
veterans uh constitutional
amendments before the voters
coming up if I remember
correctly, one of those things
that you're allowed to,
um, limit or increase
or, or have discretion
over is whether or
not it is
owner occupied
for that property. Right?
So this is sort of what she was talking
about as far as like,
do we want all
property or do we want
primary residence? Do we want
owner occupied
residences to be,
do that the constitution?
Somebody should correct me if I'm
wrong if I remember correctly
when that amendment was put in,
allows for that whether
or not you choose to
implement that by state
statute is up to
you. But those,
those things are that I know
most county assessors
have information on. We
know whether or not a property is
owner occupied. We
know whether or not a property
is the primary residence
for various reasons. Right,
because we have to apply
the head of family exemption. We
have to apply the 100%
disabled veteran exemption, which
is a primary
residence only
exemption. So there are
those things
that, that we can do and we can do
them depending on
what you're asking us to do, we can
do them fairly quickly.
Most all of these
type of bills are, it's for
the following taxable
year which provides
us sufficient
time to get
us to to be able to implement
that in a position to implement
it. Would
we need a little bit of extra
money? Probably. But again,
that comes from the county
commissions, not
necessarily from the the state
legislature.
>> Thank you for that. I appreciate
that. Thank you, Mr Chair Representative
>> Armstrong. Thank you, Mr
Chairman. I have a few
quick questions. The
3% cap is that's on
residential, not commercial,
correct,
>> Mr Chair
Representative.
So there are only
two
property classes
in the New Mexico property
tax code,
residential,
non-residential.
Um but
you are correct, right? So
only residential property
is capped at 3%
and it is all
residential property.
So
little old lady on
Canyon Road or Aguas
Rios or whatever it is
as well as
you know, the
100
unit apartment
complex
um that is income
producing that is also
residential.
>> Thank you so much. But not a
business. Business is the
non-residential. So my
question is, how
do you assess,
um, how, how would it
happen that
uh non-residential
would have a large
tax increase, property
tax increase
without a sale
without anything?
>> So it, it, it, it
wouldn't, ideally
no property owner should have a
large increase one
way or the other.
Um, a a as was mentioned
earlier, the, the issue
is the limited
information that
county assessors have
on non-residential property
and non-residential property is
again vacant land,
commercial, industrial
income producing
hotels, motels,
a all of that stuff.
Um
If, if
we do it wholesale
and we increase all of that
property at the same
time, then
yield control formula should kick
in the, the problem
that, that I have. Uh
and that many county assessors
are having is, is that so
I'll just give you an example and this is
public information. It's on
my annual report
that I give to the county commission and
that I share to the property tax
division
in the last 10 years
in Bernalillo County
residential
property, even
though there is a 3% cap
on that, the assessments,
not, not anything just
the assessment, the valuation
that the county assessor puts on that
property increase
by
46%
on hold. So yes,
many properties stayed at 3%
over a year compounded,
but as a whole, they
all went up
46%
in that same 10
years when I
took office in
January 1st of
2023
non-residential
property
increased by
4.6%.
So,
no, that there, there
is an issue there.
I'll, I'll give you an example.
Every single
Walmart
in Bernalillo County
over the last
6 to 8 years
was seeing a decrease
of 2%
on their assessment year
over year.
Right? Because
unfortunately the our cost
tables and our stuff wasn't
being updated and wasn't
being, there was nothing
to calibrate what that
valuation should be against
right there. No statistical or a
analytical information.
So Walmart would pay
large out of
state tax agents
to come in and say, here's
all this great information about
how, you know, our, our
properties are not
great and they're not doing well even though
they're making millions of dollars.
And so they would get reductions.
The very best tax savings
programs that we have for an
individual is a
valuation freeze and that
only freezes your
valuation. And if
the milk rate goes up, that
means you're still paying more taxes
regardless if your
valuation is
frozen.
So all that to
say is as it has already been
said that the
people, the
individuals
that are bearing the tax
burden for
important
public safety,
fire
wastewater, all
of those counties and state city
services
is your new homeowner,
your new homeowner who
either can't afford to purchase
a home and, and
or is gotta
pay the equivalent of
rent.
>> I I get it. Thank you. So
much. Sorry, we're short on time. So
I'm gonna try to keep, we can
keep it quick. Um,
the, so do you have
in Bernal County, do you
have, uh, uh,
any numbers on
what your non-residential
property tax paid
compared to your residential? What
are those numbers? Because I'm
assuming even though
Walmart was
paying a, getting a 2%
reduction, it was still a very high
tax. Do
you have any of those numbers?
So, >> on
average, the mill
rate for residential property
is 46 as was
mentioned for non-residential
property, that's 52
mils.
>> Ok. So non-residential was
paying more
>> per,
per $1000 worth of taxable
value, >> correct? Ok. Thank you, Mr
Chairman. So what I don't
want to do
is I'm
a private homeowner. I'm a
business owner. I have
commercial property. I have a
hotel, I have a gas
station, we pay
taxes, we don't mind paying taxes.
But what we mind is when
we save
AAA
historical
place that
is in
disarray
and then we come back the next
year and get 100
times tax increase
because we, it's
commercial
and we were trying to
help our community. And
so I don't want to paint
the light of all
non-residential
property owners as the
ones who get away
scot free and the
residential are
not paying their, are
paying for it all. So I don't,
I don't believe that I believe that
there's some unfair practices
and we need to balance that
I believe in the balance.
Um And so I wonder,
my next question is when
was the last time that you
had a
um uh
delinquent property tax
sale in
Bernalillo County?
>> Mr Chair representative,
it was last
year >> and
Mr Chairman
and sir did, how many
pieces of property were there
on that? And how many actually
sold?
>> So, if I remember
correctly, there were 57
properties on that list
when it first went
out.
Um, there
were seven
that actually made it to
auction and I
believe five of them were
actually sold.
Um, what ends up happening most
of the time is prior
to the auction.
Um, because that list is made
public ahead of time.
Um, property owners
make arrangements to sell that
to people that reach out to
them. Uh
And, and they
never make it to, to the actual
auction. >> Ok. That's,
that's the, the next part of
my, my
problem is
that we don't
set, well, we don't have those sales
enough. Valencia
County number
one in the state for delinquent
property taxes cost us
more to send out the
mailer to say, hey, you
haven't paid your property taxes
in 500 years,
but we're still not gonna auction
it off. And
so it's accountability,
holding homeowners
accountable, letting them try.
Of course, I want them to try to
fix it, whatever.
But I, I have a
problem with,
uh, raising the
non-residential by so
much. Uh, my husband and
I just built a house. I know how
the tax assessor, it is their
job to come out and assess my
house. They did
because I got a permit to build
my house. So they knew
we were building a house and
which is the right thing to
do. And,
um, but they do it
by the square
footage.
And so, ok,
fine. I have a hunting lodge.
It's a lot of square feet.
I don't mind paying that property
tax. But
then when, you know, my
neighbor does it without
a permit,
the assessor never knows.
So, you know, we're talking about
fairness here. Let's talk about
fairness for all and
not paint. I feel
like we're sort of painting the
non-residential into a
corner and saying
they're not paying their fair
share when, if it's a
commercial property,
that's a business that they're paying
taxes on their content.
They're paying taxes on a lot of
other things than what
the residential
property tax. It's
a property tax here and a,
and a non-residential,
but the non-residential is paying
a lot more taxes and other things
than just property tax.
So I just wanted to make that clear.
Thank you, Mr
Chairman.
>> Thank you, Mr
Chair.
So this, when the
3% cap
was implemented, that really
was Santa Fe legislators
trying to protect the 400 year
old house had been in the
family.
And, you know, so
suddenly,
uh, that
house which was hundreds
of years old was
sold to somebody
that was purchased for nothing because
they built it out of the mud and
hay that they did.
Um,
then some California dude came
in, offered them $3 million for that
house. Well, that meant that the
house next door all of a sudden had a value
of $3 million and
they were literally taxed out of their
house.
The argument at the time
was, that's a
Santa Fe problem. Leave the rest of
us alone of the counties.
Ok. And it's still a Santa Fe
problem. But now it's,
now we spread it
around in a different
way.
But the idea behind our
constitution and trying to
cap property
tax was
to cap
property tax.
So, uh but
you, you brought up a point
here, this is, well, we should put a 3%
limit based on income.
Well,
didn't we cap
property tax
or am I missing something
there,
>> Mr Chair.
That is correct. There are some
caps uh the
20 the constitutional cap
of 20 mills only
applies to operating mills.
Um There's a lot
of other mills to get imposed
special districts and debt mills
in particular, it's 50%
of the average New Mexicans tax
bill. Um
So that's something that's not capped. It's
something that's not,
it's not
um yield control and it's
not, I guess it's assessment
limits, but it's not yield controlled
either. So there
are some like almost
loopholes, I guess to,
to raise property taxes over
those constitutional limits.
>> So, but,
but Mr President and
Jennifer.
Yeah,
there,
I'm still
awake,
Mr
Speaker.
Sorry about that, Mr President. I
should have called Mr
Turn
somewhere in this conversation
we were talking about,
uh, to make it
fair that
it needed to have to make it
non reres I think that's,
uh, that
income or ability to pay
should be counted in
that.
Did I hear that? Right. Ok.
Good. Because, you know, when I get
the president in my head, who
knows what's going on?
Um,
but part of, part of what I'm
concerned about is how do we
calculate ability to
pay?
It's not just
how much my paycheck is
from, from an employer.
There's a lot of other things that might
go into ability to
pay.
Uh, how many
people I'm feeding is certainly
an ability to pay.
But also what are the kind of
benefits I'm receiving that may
be, may not
be taxable.
Uh
that, that
makes it too. So how would we
even, how would we
even without being
regressive come
up with that
number,
>> Mr Chair, there's a number of
ways you can calculate ability
to pay income is the easiest
one, you fill out a W-2
or you have your final estimated
payment if you're not um, a
wage earning employee.
Um that's the
easiest and most straightforward way.
There would have to be some data sharing
between TRD and the county
assessors. Um
As assessor Lara has
mentioned, but you're right.
There's a lot of other income.
Although you do claim a lot of it, your
capital gains, you claim you claim
quite a few of those income
streams.
Um
You know, food stamps is a different
thing. There's a lot of different layers
here. We'd have to explore it
further. >> So,
and I think that's, that's the problem
because when you, when you throw
in a lot of you throw
in a Pell grant, ok? That's
not taxable. You, the
state will never know about it.
Ok? But
depending on what I'm doing, that
may be what I'm living off
of. Um,
so I just think when you're, when you're
measuring ability to pay, I think
that's really hard to come up with.
I, I would like to point
out that,
uh, when General
Kearney marched into Santa Fe
in 1847 he
wrote the Kearney code
and, well, he probably
had staff write it, but it
was a, it was an
American
laws but the
tax code,
um, and on
there he had the, there's 33
sentences in it,
but the last
10 are what the tax
collector can't do.
So there's really only 23
sentences. But some of my favorite
parts here are,
uh, there shall be level
levied on all
peddlers,
uh, a territorial tax
rate as follows. One
if the pedal peddler
travel and carry his
goods on foot,
$5 for
every period, six for every
sixmonth period
two,
if on one or more beasts
of burden $5
on every horse or beast of
burden for every six
months.
Three, if a cart or
other carriage,
$8
for every six
months.
Uh, he apparently had a
real problem
with, uh,
billiard tables
upon every license to keep a
billiard table. There shall
be level leveled, levied
a tax
of $30 for
each table.
A dram shop which is a
bar shall
be leveled a tax of
$10. So
apparently billiard tables
were much greater
sintax than a
bar.
And, but all of the
taxes, uh, here were
business taxes. That,
that's how they funded the,
the territory of New
Mexico.
Then
we lived under those
taxes for a really
long time. The first
New Mexico tax code
was in 1915. We became a
state in 1912. So we lived under
the Kearney code for the first three years
of statehood
and then we changed it to property
tax. In this case, it was almost all
property tax,
but the property tax included
personal property.
So we taxed your bed and
your dining room table.
Uh, the each chair you had
in the house. Uh
and, and how that worked. And
I've got this here if you want to read it.
Um And it was 23
pages. We went from 23
census to 23 pages.
Just, just sharing that,
you know, the tax code was easier
to read than even if it was
written in English. It's difficult
for me to say,
um
the, the state legislature
came together and they would
say, gosh, we need
$10.2
billion or at the time, it was
probably 1000
$200
to run the state
and we're gonna send that
that out to the
counties. Uh
So we would say Bernal
Leo County has to come up with
$300 in San Juan County
has to come up with $75
who it is to get to that,
that amount. And
then the county commissions
would then levy
the rate and then the tax
collector would go out to your house and
see how many chairs you had and collect
the money to hit that
amount.
And then the great depression
happened and your chair wasn't worth
anything and then we
had to change the current tax code, which
now has something like 1200
pages.
So
I like Kearney's better. It's easier
to read. It was 23 pages.
But when
we, when we're looking at the
valuations and we're not
sure, especially
on commercial
properties.
Do we not have Zillow? I
mean, I can
probably figure out close to
what a building is
worth a few
minutes.
>> Mr Chair
Senator.
Um
It is very difficult
to
um
verify
the algorithms and the modeling
that Zillow uses and they
typically only
value
residential property,
they don't value
non-residential
property. Um
And then if they
do
um
a as is the case with
non-residential income producing
commercial property,
you typically don't just
buy the brick and mortar,
right? You don't just buy the land and
the improvements itself, there's some
sort of sauce in there, there's
concessions, um
There's credits, uh
There's goodwill,
there may be name, brand
stuff. Uh The property
tax code doesn't allow us to
assess or value
those intangibles
or intellectual property.
We are tasked with valuing
the brick and mortar. Um
And so we would, if
we, we try to use something like
Zillow or some of these other
subscriptions, which we do
subscribe to many, many
county assessors pay for
these vendors to, to
provide certain information.
Um We still would need
to sle out, you know, sort
of the meat and potatoes
from the gravy and the
sauce which
comprises the entire
valuation or purchase
price of that particular
property. So
it's i
it, it's a little bit more
complicated than just being able to
get, you know, on, on, on one
of these sites, you know, whether it's
trilo Zillow or anything like
that. Um If,
if we had
um equitable disclosure
again for statistical and analytical
purposes only,
it, it would provide some sort of
predictability
and stability
um for
non-residential property owners
to know sort of what the valuation
would be. Um It
would avoid sort of things
uh A as representative
Armstrong indicated. Well,
I just made a bunch of improvements
on my property and
unfortunately, on a
strictly
cost approach valuation,
then it, it's basically saying,
well, we know what it would
typically cost to make
improvements. So
that's all we can assess you on.
Um You're always welcome to
protest. But then again, it, it's
difficult to back that up if, if
we don't have true market
valuation. So that, that's sort
of the dilemma that many assessors
are
in.
>> Then people hear me
when it comes to the commercial
property,
are you actually trying to
tax the,
the value of the business
or are you trying to tax the value
of the brick, brick and mortar
in the land itself?
>> Um Mr
Chair
Senator, we
on only trying to
assess uh
the land
and improvements uh
of, of the property. Uh
We do as you mentioned we
do assess business, personal
property as well
though.
>> So I, you know, I just, when
you, when you mentioned that all of
the other goodwill and the
whatever, that's not
part of the property tax at all, I
mean, that may be what I buy the business
for or sell the business for, but
that's not property, right?
Property is just the building and
the land.
Ok.
So
I guess part of that then comes back
to who's really paying that
tax. If it's
a business that
gets moved on to
whoever's my
customer,
that's, that's who's paying that
anyway. So,
and we're certainly not capping that. So
we're raising property tax on
everybody all the time
anyway.
So while
I agree that there may be a better way
to do it,
I want to do it with much
more caution
and if we're going to do it at all, I think
we should concert consult
General Kearney
first.
So, thank
>> you,
Senator Novell. Well,
Senator, she goes up, digs
up General Kearney.
>> Thank you, Mr
President.
Um,
I've got property in Colorado
and if you want to get on your computer right
now, you can look it up and see what I
paid for.
Wide open. I don't care what
kind of property it is.
You can see, I paid
X dollars, whatever,
several properties up there, but you can
look and see the, the total
sale price didn't tell you what I've done to
it. Since I've done all
kinds of, uh, improvements
and modifications and all that.
So it's worth a lot more than that. But
you can, you can see exactly
what I paid for it the day I bought it
in 19, in 2000. I mean,
yeah, 2012.
Um, two or three other properties,
but that, that one in
2012. So
I don't have, I used to not
be so
excited about disclosure.
Uh, I was a realtor
president of the board of realtors.
I of course, a real estate
appraiser. I know exactly what,
what these are guys are going
through and I've carried this bill
for several years off and on.
I was involved and we did the
disclosure on
residential stuff
and it hadn't hurt anybody.
And in fact, I think it ought
to be, if, if I want to
know that
I'm being taxed fairly on
my street with my
house,
I need to know what the other guys
paid for my
neighbors. Bill. Sheer
got a better deal than I did or
whatever it is. I need to know those kind
of things so that I can go down
and argue with the assessor and
say I'm getting screwed here
guys. You're, you're overdo
it. I need the data.
You can't get it on your house,
even though he's got the data
on their house, you can't
get it. Uh We
don't have anything on the
commercial stuff. Uh
There's no data other than
what you just scrounge up. If
you're, if you're doing your job
as the assessor, you're calling around
what you pay, what you pay, what you
pay. That's, that's hard to
do. I've done that. That's what
I did for a living. I charged
a lot of money for guys
like George to go and find
out what everybody paid around
him so that I could appraise his farm
up north of Cedar Hill.
That's, that's the,
the nature of the business. But
these guys are working in a
vacuum on the commercial stuff
and that's what, two thirds of the value
of the real estate in the world.
It's only about 20% of
the transactions, but it's about two
thirds of the value. So
the taxes that the
property taxes are being
shifted to the residential, there's
no doubt about it.
Residential people, homeowners
are being screwed because
they're not, the other
folks are not paying it. We're, I've
tried to help them get this passed.
I'm gonna be here next year. So you guys
are gonna have to carry it on. But
it's, I think it's a real
travesty. It's worse in some counties
than others, but we've got to do
something to try to get this
fixed. We don't have to make it full
public disclosure. I know
people are scared of that. They're afraid
that, you know,
uh, I'm gonna,
he's, he's getting
away with something and I, you know, I
don't want her, I'm getting away with something. I
don't want him to know about it. That's all
the people are worried
about the full disclosure, but
at least try to have the
confidential version like we
have with the residential. We've
got to do something like
that. I
sold, uh,
my aunt's condo, I was her
executor years ago,
sold her old condo and
it was a nice little place. But
in Texas properties aren't worth
what they are in New Mexico as a general
rule. Um, my
personal home was worth about
six times
what the condo was
worth her. Taxes
were. Exactly the, almost,
exactly the same. You
want to talk about property taxes,
go to Texas and some of these other
states, man, they,
they pay tech,
uh, big numbers.
Colorado's got a whole different
system they use, uh, they
adjust the percentage that
you pay tax on, on
residential. If
you've got a home up there, you
pay, uh, currently I think
it's 7% of value. We
do 33 and a third. But
in t in Colorado they
charge only 7% of
value. That's what the tax residential
only. They shift the
burden to the commercial side.
So I think it, we're not
trying to shift things to the
non-residential
properties, but it needs to
be fair. And first
off of my rancher friend here,
ag properties are exempt.
They're not part of the problem
and it wouldn't matter if they weren't,
weren't exempt because they're
form, it's a different kind of
a formula. So it's not
gonna be ag properties. We're strictly
talking about offices and
commercial, your
kind of buildings, your,
your uh
industrial buildings and those kind of
things. They got to be
paying a fair amount otherwise you're
shifting it unfairly to the other
segments of the economy.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
>> I think the Cesa Laa will be
hiring you as a lobbyist.
Represent de La
Cruz.
>> Thank you, Chairman. Thank you
for the presentation, Jennifer.
I'd like to visit with you regarding
that homestead exemption
that you talked about.
Uh, the community that I serve
is, is has very large
elderly population,
their legacy homes, people
have lived in them generations.
Uh They are not quote unquote
low income, but they
live on that line with social
security. I hear it all
the time, Mr Chairman,
I, I
door knock like crazy
and it's a struggle
for them to pay their property taxes
and becomes increasingly
difficult even when you
think that 3% isn't a lot of
money. And so
I, I agree with
Senator Neville. We need to
fix this. Thank
you, Mr
Chairman.
>> So we just real quick because we're
running late for you to go see the
jail.
>> What I wanted to say,
uh my part of the
world,
we tax every fence
post. We
tax every
barn, we
tax every
corral, every piece of
pipe that I drive in the
ground every bit
of it's taxed
and
it's a different world.
We tax the cow, we tax
the horse.
We don't catch the dog yet,
but we should
probably,
is it >> a good dog
>> if it's a good
do.
Thank you, Mr
>> Chair.
I have some nontaxable dogs
that you can
have.
No, I, I it's different
and if you go into mckinley County,
right. I mean,
their payment in lieu of
taxes when
20% of the total
taxable
property is
taxable and 80% is
nontaxable.
That's a bigger burden we are to
bear. Right.
So, it's a completely different
scenario over here.
How do you get to 100%
when only 20% is taxable?
I mean, that's why mckinley
County is listed as one of the highest,
right? Including in the
city. But,
I mean, everything's
tax, but they also come back,
the counties come back and they set
the, the tax rate.
So where they're short, they
make that adjustment to make up in
the tax rate. Right.
So, they're not really falling short
because if, if the tax rate was
6% last year and they need
6.5% the
county commission votes and raises
that tax to get the number
they need to get to
without adjusting
valuations. Right.
But I, I agree with Senator
Woods, you know, that
you get a list and how many sheep
do you have? And how many, how
many over here in this county. And how
many in that county? And,
oh, how many, how many
pencil sharpeners do you have? And how
many computers and,
and, and a list of everything.
And I, I just kind of right.
I mean, computers are like
wearable items now and
if they only last two
years and they're really not a taxable
item. Right.
And same way with, with
this, I mean, everything is moving so quickly
that this desk
today needs to be a stand up
tomorrow. Right? And
so I just,
I, I caution
that the, the county commissioners
make up the difference by setting
the tax rate of where
they need to adjust that
to make sure that they're making the
money. And if you look at
our city of Gallup
and, and the counties,
you look in their general fund
reserves, right.
Mckinley County had about
roughly 20
million in unassigned
general fund balances.
So, where's the shortfall in the
counties? Right?
I mean, this, this not, does
not include sales tax that
they get, right?
This does not include a whole lot
of other things and you can
talk about commercial property, all
you want, but sometimes when you
buy commercial property and there's
one down the street I bought
and the leases
are not there for the income
approach, right? Because the
leases were in place and that's what I got to
live with even though I have to
make improvements to the building.
Right.
That's
it's just part of the commercial real
estate. And then, you
know, you say residential and, and
commercial tax differently. Well,
everybody's moving to these
apartments on the top and
commercial on the bottom.
What's the tax rate differentiate
in those? Right? Who
bears the burden zone?
I understand we have some problems
to solve in
certain areas, but
it's gonna be so vast. I
bet San Juan, what's your percentage
of, of
nontaxable uh
property in San
Juan
>> taxable?
94% some
government
100%.
>> So 6% compared
to our 20%
right? And then you're
trying to service large
counties. So
they, they adjust that
taxable rate to get to
the dollar amounts they need.
So
we're gonna, we're gonna do that. We're
gonna, we're gonna cap the
rate that they can, they can
tax so they
just can't keep raising the rate even
though we made the adjustment up.
They'll, they'll keep adjusting
the rate up.
So
you'll be gray haired by the time you get it
figured out
Jennifer.
So thank you guys for your
presentation. Thank you for your
time. Kelly
has the logistics for
>> and uh Mr chair members
of the committee, if I may
um just to
mention um
the assessors
affiliate um through
the NM counties
um is putting together
um some stakeholder
meetings uh at the request
of organizations like
um the commercial Realtors
of New Mexico N
um and
other um
interested stakeholders
in, in property tax
valuation uh
area, which is an economic
development organization
um for Central New
Mexico is, is also
involved.
Um
You know, we, we would
appreciate your
involvement uh in those
meetings if you would so
like to attend. And
it is sort of just to try and
craft some
sensible um
or proposed legislation
on the equitable disclosure
um and how
that affects
um
just the industry in general
as well as uh economic
development in, in the entire state.
So I just put that out there for you. I
>> mean, you can try to craft whatever
you want, but I can sit here in five
minutes and say I'm gonna put my building
in the, in the trust.
The trust is not going to allow you to
have the valuation. I'm not gonna ever
sell that building ever again. They're gonna
buy the trust
and you're never gonna see a transferable
cost or valuation ever
again.
And
it's, it's just the way the business
world works, put something in and we're
gonna, I'm gonna figure it out in five
minutes. My goal at the end of the
day, every day is not to pay taxes.
So I have more money,
but on the 10th
of May, all my money went
downstairs.
Kelly, you wanted to tell us about our
jail tour and what cell is
Senator Sheer gonna occupy
tonight?
Police station in municipal
>> court.
>> You mean a police station with no
jail? >> No
