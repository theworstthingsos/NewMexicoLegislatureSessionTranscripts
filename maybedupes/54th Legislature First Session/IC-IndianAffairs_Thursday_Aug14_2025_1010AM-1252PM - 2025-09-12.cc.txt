>> Good morning, madam, chair and
members of the committee.
Um The
State Tribal Collaboration
Act is
chapter 11, article
18 of the N
MS A
chapter 11
covers
Intergovernmental Agreements
and authorities.
So a little
background on the
Act of
over the course of a
few months early in
2008, the
Indian Affairs Department
met individually with
tribal leaders to
discuss tribes
primary issues
and policy
priorities
during the meetings,
tribal leaders emphasized
as a priority, the need
to improve and strengthen
government to government
relations between the tribes
and the state. Tribal
leaders named formal
consultations and
more frequent communication
with the governor in his office
and the I AD as
ways to improve the
relationship between the
state and New
Mexico's. At that time,
22 recognized
nations, tribes and
Pueblos
taking direction from
the tribal leadership. The executive
department then began to
develop a legislative proposal
to establish a formal
process in statute
for communication and
collaboration between the
state and
tribes.
Um The
Indian Interim Indian
Affairs Committee
heard and
endorsed the
proposed legislation on
December 17th,
2008
Senate bill 196
the State Tribal Collaboration
Act. Um
And I don't suppose this will come as
any surprise was introduced
by Senator John Pinto
on January 22nd,
2009.
Um Following a couple
of committee hearings, it do pass
endorsements. It moved to the Senate
floor where it's pass 39
to nothing,
then moved to the house
where again a couple of due
pass endorsements and
it passed the house 62
to 0.
Governor Richardson signed
the legislation on
March 19th, 2009.
The legislation carried an emergency
clause so it went into
effect immediately.
Um The really special
thing about this pretty
short piece of
legislation
is that
it reflects a statutory
commitment on the part of the
state to work
with New
Mexico's nation's
tribes and Pueblos
on a government to government
basis that hadn't existed
before. So it
was pretty
big deal. Um,
for such a small
piece of legislation
when, when I get through the
legislation, you'll see. It's,
it's just a short
piece. So,
what's the State Tribal
Collaboration Act
do?
First, it
begins by defining American
Indian and Alaska
native as well as
Indian Nation tribe in
Pueblo and it
defines where the state agency
is under the, um,
STC
it calls
any executive level
agency
falls under the
STC A.
Um It's expanded a little
bit in terms of the
actual departments
and agencies that participate.
But um
that's what's required by
statute.
Next. The
statute required
that by December
31st of 2009,
every state agency
develop and implement
a policy that does four
things. One,
it promotes effective
communication and collaboration
between the state agencies
and nations.
Tribes and Pueblos.
Two. It promotes
positive government to
government relations
between the state and
Indian nations, tribes and
Pueblos and this
language is pretty much from the
statute. So the idea of
positive relationships
is in the
statute, it promotes
third, it promotes cultural
competency in providing
effective services
to American Indians
and Alaskan
natives.
Fourth, it establishes
a method for notifying
employees of state
agencies of the
provisions of the
TC and the
policy that
each state agency
has to adopt pursuant
to the act, which I'll get to in
a moment. So
what does each state agency have
to do? Um The
act mandates four
actions for each
state agency
first um
in the, in the process
of developing their policies.
State agencies
must consult with
representatives designated
by Indian tribe
nations, tribes and
Pueblos.
Second, the
state agency has to
make a reasonable effort
to collaborate with
Indian Nations, tribes and
Pueblos in the development
and implementation of
the policies, agreements
and programs of the
state agency that
directly affect
American Indians and Alaskan
natives.
Third, the Indian
Affairs Department has
to maintain for
public reference,
an updated list of
names and contact
information for the
chief executives of
the Indian nations, tribes in
Pueblos and
for each state
agency's tribal
liaison.
Fourth, every state
agency has to
designate a tribal
liaison, someone
who's a tribal liaison who
reports directly
to the, the head of
whatever agency or
office it
is
um
the tribal liaison
then has a series
of things they're tasked
with doing. First,
they're tasked with
assisting the head of the state
agency in developing
and ensuring the
implementation of
those four basic
policies that I
first mentioned with, of
communication and
cooperation.
Second,
the tribal liaison
serves as a contact
person who maintains
ongoing communication
between the state agency
and the affected nation,
tribe of Pueblo.
Third,
the tribal liaison has
to ensure that training
is provided to the
staff of the state agency
as required by the
act, um
which is what I'll outline
next. So
then the act
requires
three other things.
First, at
least once a year,
the governor
and leaders of the state's Indian
Nation tribe in Pueblo
have to meet in a
summit to address
issues, issues of
mutual concern. That's what the
statute calls it issues
of mutual concern.
Second, that
all state agency
managers and employees
who have ongoing
communication with Indian
nation tribes and Pueblo's
complete a training
provided by the state
personnel office
with assistance from the Department
of Indian Affairs.
And that training has to
support the promotion
of, of communication
and collaboration between
state agencies and Indian Asian
tribe. and Pueblos,
the development of
positive state
tribal government to
government relations
and cultural
competency in providing
effective services
to American Indians and Alaskan
natives.
3rd, 3rd requirement
is that no later than July
31st of
every year, a
state agency has
to submit a report
to the Indian Affairs
Department on the
activities of that state
agency pursuant
to the State Tribal
Collaboration Act
and that the Indian Affairs
Department has to compile
those reports and
submit them to the
Governor and the
legislature.
The Act mandates that each
report include.
First, the policy
of the state agency
adopted that
the state agency adopted
pursuant to the act
two, the names
of and contact information
for the individuals in the
state agency who are
responsible for
developing and implementing
programs of the state
agency that directly
affect American Indians and
Alaskan natives.
Third, the current
and planned efforts of the
state agency to implement
the policy set
forth in the
State Tribal Collaboration
Act
for a
certification by
the state Personnel Office
of the number of managers
and employees of each
state
agency
who have completed the
training required by the
act.
This a description
of current and planned
programs and services
provided to or
directly affecting
American Indians or Alaskan
natives and the amount
of funding for
each program. And
finally, the method
the state agencies established
for notifying its employees
of the provisions of
the State Tribal Collaboration
Act. So
that's what the
act requires.
Um It's not a whole
lot. I've done the training,
I did the training in preparation
for this. It's
good, easy.
No big deal.
Um
So following
the enactment of the STC
A in the fall of 2009,
the executive agency
personnel met
with representatives of the nation,
tribes and Pueblos to
develop
sort of overarching
policies and
guidelines and
goals for the
STC as
part of that effort. The group
outlined principles. These
aren't in the statute, but these are the
principles they outline
to guide agencies
and tribes in working
together
briefly.
The principles are
confidentiality,
recognition and respect
for sovereignty.
Acknowledging
acknowledgement that they're
engaging in government
to government relations,
efficiency in addressing
tribal issues and
concerns a
duty to act in good faith
toward mutually
satisfying
resolutions,
the value of informal
communication
and a duty to provide
opportunities for
economic development for
the nation's tribes and
Pueblos.
That sort of in a nutshell
is how STC
A is structured, how it
works and the pathway
they outlined
to achieve those goals.
Um The agency
reports and contacts that I
talked about are available
on the Indian
Affairs Department
website. The
web address is
www.ied.mnm.gov.
There's a tab policy
and legislation tab that has
a separate entire listing
of tribal collaboration and
consultation.
What I just asked to have
distributed to you guys is an
example of
one,
the 2025
report submitted by the
early childhood education
and care department,
just as an example of
the kind of agency
report that
is required every year.
Ok.
Um That's pretty
much it. Thank you madam chair
and stand
for any questions. >> Thank
you Paul. And we will
have the Representative
Little and Representative
Abe introduced
themselves if
you would like
ladies.
>> Good morning madam chair, good
morning fellow committee
members. Very good to have
you here in Taos.
I'm Charlotte Little,
the members of the audience. I'm Charlotte
Little. I represent
the house district
68 which is the northwest
corner of Albuquerque
and it
happens to be that I
am from the Pueblo of Taos.
My family is
from the Pueblo
and uh
my father is
from closer
to Albuquerque, Pue, closer to
Albuquerque. So we're very
happy to be here and,
and have, have
everyone here. Thank
you.
>> Good morning, madam. Good morning
madam, chair and the
rest of the committee madam members.
Y A. My name is Michelle A
Beta and I represent house
District 69
which encompasses six
counties with Mount
Taylor in the center. So I'm in
that area of New Mexico. Thank
>> you. Thank
you, representative. And
do we have any questions from committee
members as we move
forward?
Representative Zamora,
>> thank you madam chair and thank
you for the presentation. So
when you said it was a short act
and then I thought it was going to be
pretty short what you have
to present and then it turned into
something pretty big.
So, so is
everything being met up
to date? Everything's
good or, or there are still
issues with,
with the government to government
relationships with
the
>> uh in terms of reporting,
the reporting
seems to be
pretty
good. Um
What's, what's on the
website? Um I
think probably
COVID slowed down
things a little bit in terms of
reporting like it
did for every agency
department. But
uh there's a lot there on the
website, all the reports,
you know, I mean, the,
if you look at the example
report, there's,
you know, all the different departments,
you'd spend a lot of time reading a
lot of reports if you went through
them all. But yeah, they're
there >> and
thank you for that madam chair
and uh
Paula. Right.
Yes.
And, and Paul. So
you said you took the class
where, where is that class available
online or, or
how does the person,
>> the personnel office has it
available online
24 hours a day. All you have to
do is sign up,
watch it. It's not even
that long really,
but it's
available. >> Sounds
good. That's all my questions,
madam.
>> Thank you, Representative
More Senator Souls.
>> Thank you madam chair. And I think my question
is very similar
is, and I
think you said it was
2008
when the law
was first, was
enacted,
>> was enacted in 2009.
They started working on it
early in 2008.
>> And so in the time between
then, how
has
the state administrations
and all done in complying
with it? Have they mostly
complied some
agencies better than others? Do
we have any information as
to, you know, both across
administrations but across
departments. We
as a legislator, we
regularly hear about
frustrations from the
native groups
and tribes and pueblos
and then other areas where they're
doing well. How,
how are we doing?
>> I, I'm probably
not the one to ask to make a judgment
on how we're doing.
Um I, I can
tell you there are lots of,
there's lots of information
online so it
appears that most of the state
agencies are complying.
Um, and
I, you know, I imagine it
takes them some time to do
it too. Um,
but yeah, it seems to
be as to how
well the whole thing is
working. I'm
not the person to ask about
that. >> I'm >> afraid >> I
understand. And so this may be a bit
more of a rhetorical question
because it's kind of the,
the same
type of, of a
question
is,
is compliance with the
act to check the box. We did
that or is there
real compliance
with the
intent and purpose of
government to government
relations? And
again, that's, I realize you're
not the one that's sort of
rhetorical, but I
think that captures more where
we hear the concerning
complaints that
in some agencies, it feels
like it's check the box we filled
out that it's, we don't
have to do anything else and others
that it's more direct.
And so if you want
to answer otherwise, I'll just kind of
that.
>> No, I'm, I'm
good.
>> Thank you Paul
Representative
Hernandez.
>> Thank you. Thank you, madam
chair. And uh
Mr
uh I, I really
appreciate the
uh the
information. Uh
Madam chair. My question
is um you
mentioned that the about
the tribal
liaisons.
Um and that's per
agency. Uh
uh madam
chair, how many
tribal liaisons do
we have
within our state
government?
>> You know, I, I didn't count
them. So there,
there's an entire web
page full of contacts.
Um, I as to
a number,
not sure
I could find out for you if
you, like, >> think
about it. I, I just feel it
is important because uh
um madam chair, I
think I counted
27
tribal liaisons but II
I could be
wrong,
>> madam chair members
of the committee. I don't know
that there are 27
executive agencies, but
that's one of those things where
there, there are
agencies that aren't
necessarily executive
level, um,
agencies that
are putting in
reports, which I
think is probably a good thing.
But, um, I can get
you a
number
>> and, uh,
uh, I live in, in, in
Northwest New
Mexico. Uh, the
state of uh the,
the Navajo nation is
also in the state
of Utah, the state of
Colorado, the State of
Arizona. And
so I often
uh madam chair
hear from
local government, uh
tribal officials
who have the first,
who, who, who,
who deal with uh
the, you know, the challenges and
barriers with other states.
But one thing I hear a lot
from um
those tribal officials
are is that how
um
different New Mexico is
and, and,
and the
accessibility
to, to that. And so,
II, I just want to
uh uh send kudos
to, to
those that are
helping to
ensure that we're,
we're moving along with
STC A
because
III I hear
other
uh tribal
tribal officials that,
that say that that's something that,
that they wish that they could have
in their state. But
um um
the
madam chair, my, my, my,
my, my last question is
on the um I'm,
I'm trying to get a
full understanding
on the
uh
the,
oh
when,
when the tribes get
funding and
then, then there
has to be
a Inter Governor
Intergovernmental
Agreement, the
IIG a
um is, is,
is there a time,
is, is there presentation
on, on that process
madam
chair?
>> I'm not sure
I, are we
going to do a presentation on it?
I think that's one of the
things we we have
ballpark for one of the next
meetings, >> right? We
do have a
coming forward in the
last two
meetings that we have, but
there might be interference
with some of one of our
meetings we
see.
Go ahead. Thank you. >> Thank
you. I, I just wanted to
put that out on the, on the table.
That's something of
importance.
This is that I've heard
from leadership
uh especially from the Navajo
nation. And
I, I just want more clarification
on that and I'll also do
my own uh you
know, insight. Thank
you. Thank you madam
chair,
>> Representative
>> Little.
Thank you madam chair. Thank
you so much for your
report, Paul and my
apologies that I I missed the
front end of it.
Um
uh
Been around for in
the involved with
tribes and
tribal governments for quite some
time, madam chair for many
years. But uh and I remember
when this
was established, uh
and
uh the
Indian Affairs Department
was elevated to that
position. So
one of the things that we were
hopeful of at that
time was
that
not only would
there be these liaisons
established within
the agencies, but there
would be a
consistent,
a consistent
dialogue that was taking
place between them. Uh The
agencies and the
different
uh travel governments
or actually even
within the different
um
areas uh specialty
areas. And what by
that, I mean,
uh things
like um
the Elder Services
um in
communities
uh
services such as that,
that this, that
madam chair where
communication has not been
as consistent or has been
felt to not be as
consistent as it was
possible as was
mandated.
So
what
recourse, I'm
wondering how
do we ensure that
that happens because this is set
up as a consultation
or as a, a
document that sets
out the goals to
achieve this. Um
But how do we ensure
that there is
uh that we can circle
back to ensure
that that actually does happen
aside from the,
the reports.
And I'm that question may
be directed
to another
agency perhaps, which
is actually
I'll, I'll finish that
thought and then I'll come to the next one.
Thank you, >> madam chair.
I, I think that is a
question probably
better directed at
the executive.
It's certainly possible
for the committee to
endorse a letter to the
executive
um reminding
them of their duties
under the S DC
A.
Um I, you
know, like I
said, policy
decisions are outside
the scope of my duties,
>> but
that, that is understood.
So what I um
and I appreciate you
uh presenting
taking the lead and presenting
this information today.
So, um in
relation to
the number of agency
liaisons,
um you're going to
check into madam chair,
he's going to check into the
number that are in place.
Now, I'm also
interested to know what
departments are vacant
where there is no
uh liaison
if there happened to be
any. Um And
I'm curious as to how
long that's been, it may just
have been a retirement, it may
have been somebody moving on to another
position, whatever the
case may be.
Um And for
the length of time that that
happens, madam
chair, I
am curious about this
because some of the
uh the issues that come
up, issues of taxation,
issues of housing
issues, of infrastructure
in all across the
board, those are all
extremely important
the to the
tribal governments uh
such as they are
to municipalities
and county governments.
So having that
connection is
very,
very important
and to the
extent that's possible
here to find out
and help, assist
in the future about getting those
positions filled if there's
difficulty.
Um
uh
I think we would like
to help with that.
So that is uh
I would like to
ask for that information
to be added
to >> madam chair.
I will find
those numbers and find
the missing
people, the missing
spots. How about that?
>> If there are any
because it may be, they're all just
fine.
Thank you madam
chair.
Uh I'm I'm glad to
hear madam. Sure that the uh
we will have
another
a
discussion.
Three.
Ok. All right. Thank
you. So I look forward to
having a, maybe a deeper
discussion about this.
Um, and,
um
it's gonna take work on my part
to make sure that I'm
comfortable or that I'm familiar
with the, with this
act and
ensure that
um,
thank you.
>> So, one
of the reasons we do
have this on it is so
that the new members would become
familiar with it, ask your questions.
Um, we can get it and then we can
forward those questions to the Indian
Affairs Department as they present
so they know what you
guys are wanting to
know. >> Thank you
madam chair. That's the end of my
questions for the moment. Thank
>> you. Anybody else with
questions on here.
I have a couple
before you go.
So in that act,
most of it's just stating
what is going to happen,
but not anything
about enforcement.
So they just don't need it
and then they cry loud
about it. >> I'm sure you're correct.
There's no enforcement
mechanism
>> and as far as we know, there
was not any funding directly
put in it and it was
just, I
guess encompassed through the budget
as it moved or was
implemented.
And I don't know if you
want to comment much about
the training you went
through, um,
that you
have a question,
ok, about the training
you went through,
um,
summarize it a little.
So that because this is
what you're speaking to is
a training that for
basically every
employee
within our
state government that's going to be
dealing with tribes stations of Pueblo's
who's required to take it, I guess
in that sense, >> I'm sure
that that's correct.
Any agency
personnel who
deal in any way
with,
not, not necessarily
nation tribal promos, but
specifically
American Indians and
Alaskan natives.
So
whether they are members
of Nation
tribe or Pueblo or not,
um,
the training,
uh,
was
ok. Um,
it was not particularly
detailed.
Um,
and I'm sure
to some extent
when they start doing
things online like
that, it must become more
difficult to,
uh, get stuff
established.
It may be that
this committee should write
a letter to the state personnel office
asking
that
the training be more
detailed. Uh,
certainly more
maybe culturally
oriented.
Um, you know, it's,
it's sort of a
bare
fact. Uh,
bare bones training
is what it comes down to.
And
so
could it be better?
Um,
I learned some but not
much that I didn't already
know. So,
uh, you know, there's,
there's seldom training that you
go through that you don't think
could be better in some
ways.
>> And Paul
the,
because
you
not native to New
Mexico, you came
in. >> I'm sure
that's
correct.
>> And I think that's one of the things
with the goals, with some of
this aspect,
especially with our Indian Affairs
Department. Because I know our former
Secretary Trujillo
was very adamant to
that anybody
coming in
from out of state. And especially
when we had issues
with getting
staff
that they're coming
into, it was essential that
they really kind of understood the
uniqueness of each tribe nation
in Pueblo. And that we're not all
put into this common
box of that. We all live
in TPE or we
all do speak the same language
or even
some of our, the way our leadership
and some of the
things that we do are, are very
different and that the nations were
sovereign in that
instance.
So I think
we do need to upscale it a little
sounds like. And I've tried
to kind of, I
guess focus on that issue a
couple of sessions ago
with the secretary
and
especially when we talked about
COVID and
providing those
services,
the tribal
liaisons, those
policies
are drawn up by the
agency very
general in
this,
this legislation.
But there has not been any updates
or anything amended into
this legislation or do we know
if there were any attempts
to add anything else to this
legislation?
>> And I'm sure no
legislation hasn't been
amended since it was enacted
and
my research didn't
find any attempts
to amend it.
So
no
>> Representative Royal
Cabrera who joined
us and if you would like to introduce
us and if you have any questions,
representative,
>> thank you, madam chair and
members of the
committee. Good morning.
Uh Those in the audience
and those viewing, my name is
Patricia Roybal
Caballero. I represent
House District 13, which
is the far southwest quadrant of
Albuquerque. And
I'm a proud member of the Piro
Monto Tiwa tribe from Donan
Las Cruces.
So, um and
I'm happy to be here. I've been on this
committee for it seems
since day
one. So I'm very happy
to be here in preparation for
today. I did
have a few questions. I,
and, and just
two questions uh
because of,
I've not
heard and I don't believe
we've ever been
told,
but I'm wondering how
the act itself
operationalize
the state's trust
responsibility to
tribal governments
beyond
just
the symbolism, un
symbol symbolic
recognition.
How
um more
deeply does it
operationalize? That's one
question. And then I have one
more
>> manager uh representative.
I think
that's a policy question. I
probably can't answer. But
um certainly
the act
is
aspirational
and doesn't
have any sort of teeth
to it. There's no
penalty for not
complying with
it.
So
it, it, it, it's
definitely an aspirational
sort
of.
>> And I think, and I'm,
that's what I
assumed based on
what I understand.
Madam chair,
I think it behooves us as we
move forward to explore
more deeply, how
we can actually
put more teeth into it if
we don't have the teeth into it
because I think what we've
had for
generations is
we've had a negation
or a lack of
responsibility
by not just
our federal government but our state
governments in
actually operationalize
the trust agreements
or honoring them
or
um
just placing,
I mean, we've had to fight for
consultation when
in fact, had
the act
operationalized the
trust agreements.
We may not have had to fight
so hard. Um
And we may not still be
fighting so hard.
So we, in my view, I
think we, we need to
um actually explore
more deeply into
it because
as I said, we,
we have that larger
picture
and we
may find that
we've been negating
other areas
um where the
trust place
us in
much more uh
intentional roles,
having the states respond
to us much more intentionally
as they have been uh
this state in
particular. And
I think that's one of the reasons why
we're having so much um
so many issues with our
education
and a number of
other reasons, other
areas. So
then you may not
be able to answer this. I understand
your role. I asked
Representative
Block just to confirm that
you were here representing
as
a member of the
legislative staff.
So thank you for, for
doing that. So another
question that might,
we might need to follow up on
is
in the auditing
processes.
What,
what roles
do tribal governments have
in actually
auditing or
reviewing agency
compliance reports?
How are those
compliance reports
um
given to
tribes
in order to be able to not
just receive
them but
to
analyze them, assess
them, review them,
evaluate and
comment. Um
Thank you,
>> madam, chair representative. The
the act doesn't
have an enforcement
mechanism.
So
the Indian Affairs Department is
required to produce
the, the agency is
required to produce the reports.
The Indian Affairs Department is
required to
put them together
and issue an annual
report. But that's
really all
you know, I think a lot of
it is, is
sort of relies on the
tribal liaisons with
the agencies and the
tribal liaison with the
nation, tribe of Pueblo
to
insist perhaps is
a good word, but
there's no enforcement
mechanism.
>> So again, madam chair,
those two answers just
indicate that I think
um our position
as tribes need to be much
more um
front
and foremost
and we as the tribes
need to be dictating
what that collaboration looks
like. We need to be in the
position to be
stating what we wish
to seek
from this
collaborative um
measure. It's not
just the symbolism related
to enacting an
act, but what,
what is the teeth, what are the
teeth um in
the enforcement
making it not
just um superficial
or aspirational or
symbolic but actually having
meaning so that it can
be enforced when
we need to madam chair.
Thank you so much. For indulging me and
again, my apologies for
arriving late.
>> Hold on, I on that
to Representative Fernandez
and then I've got Representative
Little
of representative
>> Little.
Thank you madam chair for allowing
me to have some follow-up questions.
A couple of quick ones.
I really appreciate
that you actually took the course
again or that you took the
the the
session.
Uh I'm curious as
to the agenda,
the topics that were actually
present the content of
the course.
Um
The
status of the
tribes in
Pueblos madam chair as
we know is it can be
very complex.
Uh and they are
complex and
uh I'm curious as
to what
the content actually
is not having
seen it, which
uh also
then madam chair
follows uh up
my thought
about is it,
do you know whether it's
a one time
course
session
or does it have
happened periodically? Because
there are updates,
I was talking a little while ago
about the different forms of taxation.
We've got cigarette taxes, gas
taxes, uh gaming,
tax,
revenue share.
Um And
those uh those
are very
complex
and uh can
change, have the
ability periodically
to change.
And I'm wondering if a
person that took
this coming in,
if it's required immediately
when they come to work.
Uh If there's
opportunities,
most
companies will have
training sessions again
periodically throughout
an employee's career
to bring them up to speed on
things that are happening. And especially
if it's in specialty
areas like the water,
water issues in the state
and the,
the um
agreements with the tribes
and their status as well.
So you
may or may not be able to
answer that. But I'm wondering if
there is an opportunity
for a second
uh an
update
available to
employees.
>> Madam chair
representative.
It didn't offer me when I
finished it an opportunity.
It didn't say check back in six
months or a year
and, or
anything as far as
specific issues go
like water rights or
something like that. It's
not that detailed. I
think
in a state
personnel office might do
separate videos for some of
those issues if
they, if they were
inclined to. But,
um,
you know, you could
list issues as,
you know, a lot of
issues that and
I think they're shooting
for a one size fits all
introductory sort of
thing.
>> Thank you, madam chair. The
next piece I would ask madam chair
is actually, it's been
tossed around a bit
um uh uh
conversations outside
of our meetings. But the
uh the idea
that um legislators
would receive
training in this as
well because we sometimes
have uh periodically
we have individuals who come in
who are not from, haven't had
to deal with
these issues. And so we're
present on committees,
we're in
um working
on policies and laws that
have an impact
um across the
state, including tribal
communities. And
um has
that ever,
it's a question for you madam chair.
I guess, uh, as I'm just wondering,
has there ever been a,
a thought as
to providing that type of,
of, uh,
information,
um, to members of
the legislature?
>> So during that
time,
just trying to collaborate
with the former secretary,
that was the goal was
that everybody involved in
the state, any state
personnel all across
the board, everything we control
as a legislature, which is
state personnel would be
required to take that
training,
push back on it.
So that
that was the other thing and it
was really a good
collaboration that was happening
because the state personnel
secretary at that time
and our Secretary of Indian Affairs
Department were working
together and supported
it and really did
think it was necessary.
So that also
would be in
to me a decrease in
liability on our part
for any kind
of
that. We're, we're not meeting
the services because we're kind
of like a service state, right? A
lot of our programs are
services that are
provided to many
different our
constituents. And
some of that that we were trying
to encompass was also to
address those with
disabilities
that when they come in, you
know, don't, if
there's issues there are to
recognize.
Um so that we're actually
really being a little more helpful a little
more empathetic
to our, our, our new Mexicans
coming into seeking those
services because those are
resources that
they need, they need to
address but not where they come in the
door, get turned off
and then they walk out the door
because of the
interaction and then
we don't get anything
done.
>> Thank you madam chair.
Um I
appreciate. Yes,
I appreciate you coming back to
me again and um I
think that would be the end
of my questions for the moment
for >> today. Thank you. Thank you,
Representative
Hernandez.
>> Thank you madam chair
again. I'm uh
um um
I'm gonna kind of push a little
harder on, on these tribal
liaisons.
Um I've, I've
seen really
um you know, strong
uh relationships
and communications madam
chair. I served five years on the
Navajo Nation,
uh head start
Parent Policy
Council and
I'm really glad to have
this presentation
document from E
CE CD
because I saw that tribal
liaison frequently,
you know, I would get communications
from, from, from the tribal
liaison from that
agency. Uh So I
understand madam chair.
Uh So it's
agency by agency
on, on
the progress with the tribal
liaison. Is that correct madam
chair? I'm sure that's
correct.
Um And madam chair,
that's I think where
uh one of the, the
challenges, you know, with
this is because
um you know,
there's a lot of economic
development help happening
in Northwest New Mexico.
Um And
I'm finding out about
you know, whether
it's, it's the
agency
uh uh uh
showing up to,
to an event or,
or it could be
something at a smaller
level where, where
there's, there's another important
discussion happening
in my district.
And I, I madam
chair III I just wish
that there could be
um you know, effective
communication with the
all tribe liaisons with,
especially with us legislators, you
know, uh madam chair. I think that's
just something uh II
I could, you know,
ask for
um as we
strengthen
the STC
A and I just
wanted to make sure
that before we leave the
discussion that you
know, that we could get some,
some progress out of it. Thank
you madam chair.
>> Thank you, Representative Hernandez,
Representative
Abera. >> Thank you
madam
chair.
My question and comment
and it might be questions. I'm
coming from a
district that represents
part of Navajo nation
and then three
Pueblo communities.
And one of the things
I've noticed is
that
looking at the list that's
on
the I AD website that
has a list of tribal
leaders.
If you have been
in the work
sector of tribal
governments, you know
that it's going to
change through
elections through
appointments.
Thank you. And they're
not all going to change at the
same time
and there will be
different levels
of government.
And so one of my concerns
is in looking at this
list, someone
who who may have never
worked with a tribal
nation um or
government will come in
and review this list,
perhaps, make contact
once and then
think that they've checked the
box when really
in a few months, say they
came in, in October,
January comes around, there
could be a whole new administration,
whole new council.
And then they think
in their mind that they've
established contact,
they're good, but
really, there's been a whole changeover
in government. Um
I not sure if that's part
of the training. Is it
that you watched?
I
wasn't part of the
OK. Thank you. So
that's important because
then it, we're
missing the point that there's gonna
be a lot of changeover in the
four years of the
administration you're working with
on the new Mexico
State government side, a
lot's gonna change in tribal
governments throughout.
So I represent 10
Navajo chapters
and my concern
is if I was working with
perhaps Department of Transportation
and I was the tribal liaison,
it does not say this
in the act. And so my question,
I'll give you a heads up before we get
there is going to be, how do we
amend and expand?
That's where I'm going with this.
How do you amend and expand
on what this can
do, how we can make it
work for our
communities. I'm
going there because
you have Navajo Nation listed
here and I'm a member
of the Navajo Nation. And I know
that the two people listed
here are actually
from the State of Arizona.
So they may have very
little knowledge
about New Mexico politics
and how it runs unless they have a very
informed advisor guiding
them. I would
like for
opportunities and
resources from
every state department
or agency to be
sent to chapters
versus because they are the
local government to
be sent directly to,
to Pueblo nations
because I feel that if
it gets sent to
the individuals that are listed
here, it will never trickle
down to our communities
that need it most. And I'm
talking about there
was an a process
open recently for
Senior Center
Infrastructure money. And
there was another application for
the Transportation Department for
Road Improvement. There
was another application for
recreation projects
and chapters should
apply for these. They should
collaborate with counties and
work with these. But if
it's going directly to Navajo
Nation, my chapters
are not going to get that information
and they will miss the opportunity
to work with the state
at the end of the day. They're
still state citizens
too. They've
participated in the
elections, they've
participated in
the state government. And
so again, my question
goes back to, can you
please share how
we could amend or
expand
and
what I should be concerned
about if it's, if it's
considered um a
mandate or not a
mandate, does it need to be
funded or not help
me understand that part because I'd
love to work with
this body on
language that makes
this act take a
step further like Representative
Hernandez said and
really do more
for
communities, not
just, hey, we checked the box,
we sent it to this nation,
but if that nation is
divided and satellite,
then it should go to those
different areas.
Thank you,
>> chair Representative. Um
As far as amending
it uh
off the top of my head,
I would
be loath to really
make any sort of comment right
now. We can work on
a language that amends
it uh
in terms of
and perhaps
something to think about is while there
isn't a formal enforcement
mechanism,
the Secretary of Indian Affairs
is tasked with making
sure this stuff
happens, the reports
happen that the
policies are there that
you know that the
agencies have tribal
liaisons. So
you may want to
talk to the Secretary of Indian
Affairs about
how the act
is working or not working
as
well.
>> Thank you, madam chair. Thank
you.
Would you please remind me of your last
name,
>> Stock >> Stock?
Ok. Thank you. I want to be able to say it
correctly, Mr S
Stock Stock. Thank
you. I
appreciate that. Um,
and I think,
and I'm just predicting that
someone may say
we're doing a great job
because we haven't heard that
we're not so it's
working. But I know in
my communities the
resources are not getting back
because I don't have one community
in my district that success
fully applied for the Senior
Center Infrastructure Funds,
the Road Transportation
Fund or the Recreation
Fund. And when I come across
them, I take pictures of
it or I screenshot it and I
sent it back as quickly as I
can to someone who I know
will share it.
But um
and I'm going off of just
the contacts I've built.
So
perhaps that's why I'm
asking, is there a way we could ask
the other side of the table,
the tribes? Is this
working for you versus the
state?
>> I'm sure I'm sure
you can ask them whatever you
want.
>> Would that happen at the summit
madam chair or could that happen
in the next few months? Thank
you. >> And I think
that's one of the things I was going
to come back about
was the summit and who's
in charge of it?
The structure and the organization
of all these state agencies,
I think is the, especially
if it's an executive
department, is
the prerogative of
the governor's
approval is
my understanding. So
kind of putting some of that in
there,
it's,
I think that's
why maybe some of this
legislation was a little
bit broad in a sense
when we talk about
enforcement
going forward.
But the Indian, if it's the
Indian Affairs Department, that's
where we were trying to build it
up to where they
were really the ones
that
it's where they can do the
outreach if there's
problems, if they, where
and these tribal liaisons in
these different agencies
are supposed to be that contact.
But what it sounds
like is we put them there
and then they just wait for
the tribes or nations to contact
it. But
when we have questions and
we have issues or, you know,
concerns who do we
talk to? Who do we, you
know, we contact the tribal
liaison, they don't know
who. Well,
two, we do get our leadership
in our, with our governors
and, you know, every
year and those have
to be updated.
And the summit that's there
too. Some of the feedback
we get is it's not enough
time. They're
there. There's a short the
conversation about the issue.
They ask the questions, this
is an issue but
actually leaving the summit with
a solution does not seem
to really
happen. And then we're in
a time crunch too as we move
forward, especially if we're in a
budget cycle that
with the spending of the
money, this
particular report
here
with Dr Sua from
co she
just got on board
recently
and this really speaks to the
department and how it's
run very well because
the, the
position she's
in the person that was
in it before was very good
too. And that's why this
generation of this report
is so,
so detailed
and very well done.
I mean, I think you can almost have
all your questions answered
here
within it. And
that's because whoever's running
the agency is making sure
and whoever steps into that
role is very
passionate and moving
forward and then to
bring someone in to continue
the work is
it shows right here. I mean, she has
just been in a couple of months. This is a
2025 report
from this agency
and this is a new department
that's three years
old, four years
old, we just barely created
it. Um
But yet we have other departments
that have been around quite a while.
So I'm
glad you guys have your questions
and thank you Paul for,
you know, coming forward and try to answer
them as best as possible.
There is some work that needs to be
done because we still have our tribes
nations and Pueblos
there
as we move forward.
We will encourage
the members to email your
questions or something. You know,
if something pops up, email it to
me or to Nicole so we
can compile that, sent it to the
Indian Affairs Department
because we'll bring them forward
before us last
year.
Um I think the
report they had back to
us in I A was kind
of about three pages.
So um
just be mindful
of,
you know, the who, who's in
there and who's going to
be
making sure we're, we're
meeting those expectations
that our tribes are able
to address.
And we must be careful about the
summit too
because we assume
that we should be
actually,
it's government to government,
it's a government to government summit.
So our governors are
there with our governor at
the same level.
Ok, I go and
pop my head in. All
the departments are there
and which is good
because you can directly talk
to them, some of them do have
their liaisons there with
them. But
having that door open too
for the,
some of those departments,
it's still like, well, you still have to
go through the secretary
and I'm like, well, that's
not very good to
me because you're still trying
to trickle down, but we should be able
to go directly to the tribal
liaison. They should have the
capacity or whatever it is
they need
as far as putting
someone in a position
to, I think the
only thing we created was
ombudsman's
in, in, like
CYFD.
Um What was
the other? And there was another one where we
did ombudsman's
positions.
Um special
needs pe D
aging. We put um
directly put those
into those
departments.
So, I
it's uh
interesting time to,
to, to see where it
goes. And we're also going to be
in our own transition with our
governor here next session.
So how will
they convey and
support our tribes nations and
Pueblos when they
come in and will they need to
be going through the
training that Paul
went through to as
we go forward? But thank
you, Paul. And I
think his training is actually
being on this
committee.
>> Thank you madam chair.
I I will
get the answers to the questions
you asked.
>> Paul's been with us,
I think, right, a little after I
got in, Renee
was my staff.
She was with my grandpa too
before that. So this
committee is a very
um the knowledge
that you need to,
to learn through
here is very
narrow because of the
tribes nations and Pueblos and
even the legislation that comes
up as we move
forward.
But get your
concerns out there to us right
away. And with
those departments to that, we
might need to also bring those
departments ahead with us
and we'll encourage I to
see if we can get as many liaisons
for it as we
can.
So next on our agenda,
we have breaking ground
removing roadblocks for tribal
homeowner, Mister
Christopher
Billy.
We'll have a
and
cook will be joining
him and we don't have anybody
on Zoom
and whenever you guys
are ready and thank you for joining
us and it's good to see >> you.
All right, good morning madam,
chair of committee you need
in this
year.
I am the executive director for the tribal
homeownership Coalition in the Southwest.
My name is Chris Bli. I am
the, I am Navajo. I
grew up in and around the
four corners area and I was raised
by my grandparents on the
reservation. So, uh,
I've got a pretty strong
foundation for, uh,
my tribe, my culture,
my traditions in, in our
language.
So, um,
Crystal, you want to introduce
yourself,
>> bushes
chain?
I'm Raet born for Deer
Spring from Tuba City,
Arizona. And
it's great to see you
all chair
Pinto as
well as the other
members here of the Indian Affairs
Committee and staff. Of course,
thank you for this
invitation.
>> Um All right. So,
uh, I actually had to cut down
my presentation considerably.
Um, you know, my,
I, there's so much that
I think we can talk about in the homeownership
space so much that
my experience and my
knowledge has afforded me to learn
and to share with many people.
Um My personal
history, of course, like I said, I grew
up on the reservation. I'm a Navy
veteran. I went
to school at a su
uh I, my formal education
is actually in real estate development. I started
as an architect and realized I
don't like dealing with architects.
So I went into real estate development.
Um I worked in affordable housing
for a number of years where I started some,
some R and D projects
on Navajo. And
my initial project
was the Nagi House. I've done
a few other homes before, but
the Na Easy House is something I did
in around 2004
to 2005.
This home was
to prove that
we could essentially
operate under our own power on the
reservation. We could design our own
houses, we could use our
own tribal
designers, labor
force. Um
You know, our own funding
and, and the house was a success,
right? We, we did very well with it.
Unfortunately. Uh the,
the organization I worked with
had to pull back to Arizona.
Uh I then went on to work for
a commercial developer where I did that for a
few years and I got to kind of see
behind the curtain and I, and I got to see
how the money flows and, and how
quickly things move uh
at a commercial level. And from there, I
actually went to work
in local governance. So I worked for my
home community in Upper Foodland for about
six years. And I
understood the tribe
I understood from the inside
the issues. I, I got to
use my education. So I did civic
develop for my home community.
Um you know, and, and it was a
passion of mine. Um
unfortunately, as,
as a representative,
Abada was talking about some
leadership changes, right? And,
and, and unfortunately, the,
the work and the momentum we had
left with leadership
and, and so I parted ways
and I actually got my real estate
license. Um I've done a number of
other things. I was also a president for the American
New Chamber of Commerce in the State of Arizona
as well. I've, I've operated a number of other
businesses. Um, but
as a, a real
estate agent, I've been
licensed in Arizona for about nine
years. I've helped over 100 native
families become
homeowners and I've engaged
with thousands of native
families. We've done uh,
education, right.
We've gone out into the communities.
I've listened to a lot of
folks and there
are number of things that I that I
understand fundamentally that I'm
gonna share with you today, right.
So, the organization, uh, our, our
nonprofit
today, our focus is really
improving homeownership in
tribal communities. All
right. And, and we are funded
by Wells Fargo. It's, it's private
funder that's actually
allowed us to kind of move
at our own speed
and the move in the gray areas,
areas that typically aren't
seen by the state,
by the feds or by the tribe
or, or, you know,
for instance,
you know, housing
counseling tends to be
around, hey, you need to be
hud certified and we've got to teach you
how to do these things, right.
But the hud housing counseling
that typically meant for natives never
takes into account that
that counseling actually comes
in at step three. Right. There's
step one and two,
right? And, and I'll talk about that in a
minute. That is, it
doesn't exist in Indian country.
I'll get into the history of that and why
that's an issue, right. So
our mission again, overall
is to increase homeownership
in tribal communities.
Now, our history, uh page
three for, for some of you following
along, uh, we were actually,
oh, it's gonna be on
the, the, the, that, that
guy, the one that's done in
portrait. Um I'll talk about the
case study in a minute.
Um Our organization
was actually founded,
uh by the New Mexico Mortgage
Finance Authority back in 99
by a gentleman by
the name of Eric Schmeer. The
organization was founded to
be a voice for
the, the Pueblos in the central
corridor, right, to,
to uh engage
with the state to engage the feds and
to engage with the tribes.
Um, our
organization
really didn't have a lot of funding.
So it was kind of a volunteer basis.
It wasn't until 2022
23. Uh, that
Wells Fargo came along and,
and it was able to infuse
us with, with capital
and, and that's when I was brought on in
2023.
Now, I understood
a number of things with regard
to homeownership. And so what I did
is I actually expanded us into
Arizona. Right.
Um, many of the tribes
I know that, that I've engaged
with, don't really recognize the New
Mexico Arizona state border
most of the time. If we ask, hey,
what part of the reservation you say? You
don't say New Mexico side, I'm from,
we're from the west side or they'll talk about the
chapters that areas are from, right?
Um And it happens in, in, in
the Pueblos as well, right? They're
not saying, are you from New Mexico? What Pueblo
are you from? Right. Um
And, and what we understood
fundamentally is a number of
the problems that we face
around. Homeownership
translate across
that border. They, they translate
into Tahou
Aum, they translate into
Pasco Yaqui, into
White Mountain Apache, into
Horia, right into Kuchi.
A lot of these issues.
I is something that we all, we
all share together. OK.
So moving on to the next page
here. Now,
um I'm gonna ask a
question. I, I don't know if this is going to work. It
typically works everywhere else, but I'm
gonna ask a question. How
many I'd like for you to raise your hand
if you know what a mortgage is,
raise your
hand, raise your hand. If you know
what a mortgage is,
you know a mortgage? Ok. How
many of you understand that
you have to have good credit to get a
mortgage. How
many of you understand that mortgages are
used to buy homes?
How many of you
understand
that a home over
time? Is, is it going to be worth more
or less,
more more? Right.
So we understand that it's an appreciating
asset. When I ask
these questions in our
classes, they say
this, this last one we did in Shiprock,
New Mexico, right? We had nearly
60 attendees,
maybe one or two people
raise their, raise their
hands, right?
So when I say that
the hud counseling and, and,
and, and the education
that's being offered comes in at
step three. They never take into
account that we don't
have the basic, the real estate
fundamentals in place
off the reservation.
It's part of our culture, it's part
of American culture. We
understand housing, we understand
real estate. There's a massive
industry built around
this. We understand
that there are home flippers, right?
There are builders or construction,
there are contractors, there's it,
it's huge, but you go on to the
reservation. It does not
exist. In fact, the
only housing developer
in the reservations
are the housing authorities,
right? And, and I'm gonna get into this in a
minute and
when we
hear from the feds,
we hear from
the state agencies, why isn't
homeownership
taking track? Why or
why do we have high
foreclosure rates? It's because we don't,
we don't understand the fundamentals.
We don't get the basics, right?
So if you look at this page which is
history of tribal real estate, and I,
and I want folks to understand this
because when we explain
this, we have aha moments,
right? We had conversations with
veterans affairs, we had
conversations with
hud and when we
explained this, they
went, we didn't get this, we
didn't understand this. We need to go
back to basics with the
education and the engagement
that we are providing. We need to go back
to, to, to step
one. Now on the
reservation back in the 18 fifties. I
mean, we're all familiar with this, right?
We, we were at war with the federal
government and they
told us, hey, we're gonna move you guys
to this patch of land,
but we're going to keep control of it
for you. You can't sell it,
you can't buy it. It's not going to be
valued right
off the reservation. We've got
homestead, we've got cities that are growing,
we've got real estate that's
moving, right.
All of this is happening.
Uh And I talk about uh the
San Juan River and, and some
of the communities around the San
Juan River. And we talk about homestead.
I met a family there,
this family, they were Hispanic
family there. They moved into
that area around 1910,
19 twenties, right? And they were
farmers
and over the
generations
as kids were
born Parce
parcels of that,
of that land that they took
was, was, was given
down and they were cut up
and people bought and
gave those, those homes
and those lands to their
Children.
When they bought that, they bought that, that
large to say 100
acres,
they bought that for pennies on the dollar.
Ok. Today
you look at the value, there's six
or seven homes on this. What do
you think the value is
today?
Millions. It's
in the millions.
The generational wealth
that they built
over the years was
something that was afforded
to them. They understood how this
works. Now, those
homes, those la those
lands are being put
into trust so they can
what circumvent
taxes essentially.
But they understand that and they're teaching
their kids this and it's
moving down the cycle just
across the river on
Navajo. What
happens?
You can't own the land,
right? There's no value
to it. You can't sell it, you can't
do anything else.
This has happened in
many other tribal communities
throughout New Mexico and Arizona.
We don't have the
fundamentals
on the, on
the, on the reservations.
The the concepts of, of
traditionalism have become
deeper rooted.
OK? And, and, and
what I mean by that
is our homes are sacred
to us, right?
We our kids are born
there, right?
Our grandparents are born there in,
in Navajo. What happens when somebody dies
in a house? What do we
do? That's
it. The house is bad. You can't do that. You knock
a hole in the wall, right? That house
is gone. What happens uh uh
off the reservation when somebody dies
on land or dies in the
house, you do a
disclosure. Somebody
died in the house, you move it on and you can
sell the house. It's
very different,
right?
And when we look at
Pueblo communities, some of
these villages have been around
for 100 and 5200
years and those
buildings have been there for a long
time. Those families have been in
those houses for a very
long time.
They're not gonna sell those homes,
right? They're not,
it's part of their traditions, it's part of their
culture.
The issue
is when we start to
bring the modern
concepts onto
the reservation, we
want to sell, there's there's equitable
assets, there's value to these
houses, right? So if you
go to the next page,
we talk about the conflict
today of traditional
versus modern concepts,
right? The traditional side as I
talked about the home is a
sacred space, right?
Birth celebration,
ceremony, protection.
These are our homes
and over
generations,
traditionalism
didn't talk about selling your
house, they didn't talk
about an equitable
asset. It
just didn't exist in many of these
communities, right?
But the the modern
concept which is,
which is very prevalent, it's it's a good
thing because we understand that it builds
generational wealth,
right?
As these two come
on to the reservation, there's a lot
of conflict,
there's a lot of conflict,
there's conflict at the leadership
level, at the policy making
level, at, at the,
the level of
authority. So for instance,
housing authorities, there are folks
who are, are working
within housing authorities who don't
believe you should sell your home.
Right? And they'll fight you. I've
had people flat out. Tell me I'm
going to tell my leadership
not to agree with you that
you should not, these people should not be
allowed to sell their homes,
right? And we, and, and, and I
get it and I get it.
But the conflict
and the issues that it's creating
it, it's limiting
access to, to families
equities, right?
The case study that you guys have
in front of you. I highly recommend
that after this is done, read it. There's
a lot of things that we discovered those
things, things that I already knew
to be true, but we had to write
them down, we had to put them out that we had to
air them out.
The case study is a little controversial. There are
a few people who don't agree
with the things that are in there, right?
But it is what it is. These are the things that
happened.
All right. Next page
homeownership on the reservation. What
does it mean for us? Right?
As we kind of move into this
space, equity is a
new idea
off the reservation equity. We
all understand what it is. We all
understand that we sell our home.
You know, it's essentially the
profit.
Now, in the case study, I
talk about uh
the home that we sold in Lehi
Arizona when
we sold at home and, and I'm probably
getting ahead of myself here.
Uh, we listed that
house for sale
and when I put it up originally
for 100 and 55,000, I
had a lot of community members who are very
upset. I had grandmas and grandpas
calling me cussing at me saying I
shouldn't be doing that
that the home is too expensive. People
were very uncomfortable with the
number extremely
uncomfortable, right?
But we talked about
equity
community is a
big one.
Community is, is
tricky to nail down
because again, I'm gonna talk
about this in a minute. We're
missing a big piece of our
community and we're losing them
to the border towns as
we kind of go through this process.
We have a lot of folks
who are, what, what we call
bouncing. These
are returning veterans,
college graduates, right? These
are working professionals
and small business owners who can't
find housing on
the reservation. And again, I don't want to get ahead
of myself. Right. We're
losing generational wealth.
We understand that generational wealth
works very well off the reservation.
But when we go to the reservation
without the history or the
systems or the
industry to support this,
we don't have access to that
as American
people who
live on a reservation, we
don't have and are
afforded the same right to generational
wealth,
local economy growth,
right? And again, there's,
there's a piece I'm gonna talk about the missing
middle. They are a big piece
of this, right?
We understand that
homeownership real
estate off the reservation
is a massive
cornerstone
of, of, of our
economies. It's
huge in America.
It's multi trillion dollars
and it supports all the ancillary
businesses, right?
Real estate agents, title companies,
contractors, right?
You've got all these people who make products
for, for housing
does not exist on the
reservation.
When we talk about traditional
values. Again, the
conflict, right?
My generation, the folks
coming after me have to be the
bridge, we have to bridge
that, right.
We have to figure out where
the middle is, what we're willing
to compromise.
I want to, to
make it very clear
that as a
tribal person,
myself,
as somebody who's come
up brought up, traditionally,
I have evolved,
there are portions of me that
I have assimilated. This is America,
this is who we are. We are an evolving
people,
right?
Our traditional values,
they are important to us.
We need to keep the things that we
can keep. Right.
It's important
as we move into the homeownership
space and we begin to open this up.
It creates more jobs,
right? More contractors, more
licenses, more permits,
right. We've got to create
that.
All right. So we'll talk
about this case study a little bit. So the case
study that you have in front of you and, and
I'm gonna go through this pretty quickly because I know I'm a
little short on time now.
The case studies, we had a family who reached out
to us about 2.5 years ago, lived on the
Navajo reservation. They were part
of the Navajo generating station
shutdown. Ok.
They were one of the families that
had to move because this
massive economic powerhouse
left. So they
were left with a home.
They tried to
hold on to this house.
But what ended up happening was it was
getting broken into it is being vandalized,
right? People were coming in jumping
the fence. Um, they
didn't live there, they didn't see themselves
going back there. Most of their kids moved
to the city. So they said, you know what can
we sell the house?
Absolutely. The
system within Navajo
exists. Navajo
is kind of our focus a little bit uh
with the coalition because
we understand that Nava
has a lot of the pieces.
It has a lot of the pieces to
create a sustainable
housing industry,
right? Whether they know it or
not. So
we focused on this, we got this
done, but it took us
2.5 years to close
this and we uncovered a number of
problems, right?
And again, when we originally
did our um
our appraisal of this
home, it came in at 100 and
55,000, right?
And over time over that 2.5 year
course, we all saw the
upswing in the real estate market.
Over over those years, this
saw that, that same upswing. So we jumped
about 100 and 70,000.
Uh Now I ran the numbers on this
comparably, right? I
removed the land from this. I came
out to about 100 and 85,000,
right? If we were to look at the,
the, the, the
um um
the page market, right? So,
so in page this
home was listed like
it was around 242
180,000, right? That's what we were
seeing at that time.
We got this home close in the
MLS. Now this
was a first of its kind because we
put it on the market
publicly. It went
into uh
Zillow, it went into
realtor.com.
Um And, and, and we
had, we had to kind of pull things
along in the MLS to make this
work. Initially. They told us,
no, you can't put this house on the
market. It's, it's on
the reservation. We ran into all sorts
of issues, right. We had to figure out workarounds
on this. Uh but we
were able to get into the market and I'll tell
you as soon as again, we
this thing came on to the market. My
phone started ringing.
Uh people were upset
but at the same time,
we had a number of people
who were PreQue saying
I want to buy this house, right?
We ran a number of other issues
with the land, right? But we
had uh teachers,
we had working professionals, I think we had
a park ranger. They were all interested in buying
the home because they couldn't find
anything at that time
and page, right?
So we know the market and the need was
there,
right?
So we ended up getting this home
closed. Uh And, and we
brought this forward to
Navajo Nation.
Um and Nava Nation kind of
worked us through this. We actually ran into a lot
of roadblocks and we had to get the executive
office involved and the chief of staff
and they helped us bring some of those roadblocks
in anyway. There's more information
definitely read about that. Um
My information is I think on the
last page and you guys can definitely feel
free to reach out to us.
All right. Um Next slide,
we're gonna talk about home homeownership
net worth. Um And we all
understand this. I think I need to, to,
to, to really dive into this.
We all understand that owning real
estate or owning your home is going to
increase uh your
net worth versus somebody who
is uh consistently
um renting,
right?
All right. So the missing middle uh
page nine,
now, why are returning
professionals?
Um This is I, I
hit on this a little earlier
and, and, and as a
real estate agent, um
we've had a number of people
who've reached out to us to
help them sell homes on
the reservation, right?
Um We worked or I
worked in Kerrigan Estates for a
number of years and, and I'll be
honest, the homes in there are very
expensive. Um
And, and the
market, they,
they really
weren't at the market. The first
home I sold in there, I had to talk
to uh the,
the owner and we had to try to
bring that number down. My initial
uh comparable
analysis, put the home, I think
at 415,000,
which was really high.
And we had a number of
people again who came and many
of the many of the prelaw we were seeing
again were the 250 to 350
range, right? We had somebody
who came into the, to the
390. And in order
to get that deal closed, I gave
up some of the money that I
was earning to make this thing work.
Right. But we got it
and that was the lowest we
we we could go. But as more
homes came on, what we were
finding is uh there
were builders in these areas who
were, who were over inflating
the comparables. And it was the
only thing that we could do was
was talk to the sellers and get
them to come down on that. Right?
But it was few and far
between. So as
we saw this and again,
we saw a lot of these numbers,
a lot of these folks coming back saying I'm
pre qu, right? I
worked with a young
woman um
who was, who got her
doctorate, who is well
qualified, but she qualified
at the 325 mark.
We couldn't get her to where
these homes were coming in, right?
And I couldn't get the sellers to come
down. They didn't want to eat the
50 to $60,000 in
order to get her into the them, right?
So we looked for almost
a year and a half when
she finally threw her hands up and said I'm
done. She went to gallop. She
bought a house easy. She got it done
in about 45 days.
Right. We
had other people who were in the
same boat. We had another person
who was a business owner
who couldn't, who couldn't get it done.
We couldn't, excuse me, we
couldn't find housing for
them.
So, what we find again
are folks who are,
uh, the missing middle, our
middle income. 80% and above
some, most of these guys, I'm gonna be honest,
they're, they're 100 and 20 152
100% ami right?
Sometimes 300%
ami and we
can't find the land for them to
build, we can't find the
house for them to buy,
right? Uh So
they end up leaving, they go to Farmington,
they come here to Albuquerque, they
go to Phoenix, they go,
you know, to Flagstaff
inventory on the reservations
is, is minimal.
Um
And the issue that we're seeing
is that as these folks go to
the housing authorities, the housing authorities
are telling them we don't have
housing for you. You make too much
money,
right?
You you're over income.
And so a lot of them are frustrated
like, hey, I make good money,
right? And
and and again, I'm gonna do a little bit of a
dive into this issue
here. So
area immediate income, right? So
next page page 10, we
talk about the
the area immediate income that
is typically set
uh by the
States and is set by
um it's the
ceiling set by
the feds on who
can purchase homes,
right? So when
we talk about housing authorities,
housing authorities, a big
chunk of their funding is
gonna be from the hostel, right?
The IC DB G, the Community
Development Block grants,
those funds are
typically tied to
regulations
and when the
housing authorities are
looking at their numbers,
right? Most of the folks who are
applying with them
are typically the 80%
60% below ami
So when these housing, these,
these funds come in from
the hoda, right?
There's, they have a lot of regulations
set.
So for instance,
uh you know, there is
a housing authority right now
who pretty much
removed, you know, well, I think
they've changed since then but they, and,
and I don't want to name them. Uh,
but they, they
initially didn't
have a homeownership program.
They were looking at primarily
providing homes for their 80
80% 60% below
A I. But because
they were the only housing developer,
nobody else was building homeownership
units. They lost a lot
of people. They had a lot of folks who
bounced, they had folks who came into
the community couldn't find houses and they went
somewhere else.
The adverse effect of
this. And what we,
what we are seeing
is that the biggest
need and, and,
and this is kind of a snowball
effect, right?
Is that the
tribes are, are
the housing authorities
are focusing on
the 80% 60%
below Ami, right?
And if that Ami is
$40,000 for that area,
right, then we're looking
for folks at the 32,000
$28,000 mark.
Right? Uh
And a lot of
these folks have the
ultra low incomes in these
communities. So what we start to
see is we start to see them concentrating
our poor,
right? And many of these
subdivisions,
they can't help it. They don't
really have another option. If they
want to keep their people employed,
they want to keep the organization
moving. They've got to focus on
these areas, right?
And so many of them
forgo a
the the 100%
ami because
sometimes when we get into that
100% ami we start talking
about debt leverage as well.
Hey, we're going to
use these funds and we're going to leverage
them, right?
And tribes are very debt
averse, especially when we start talking
about development Housing Authority. They
don't want to take loans out
in order to sell those homes to
people who are above the 108%
ami mark. Right?
So again, homeownership loses
out, capturing
the missing middle
is, is exacerbating,
right?
So barriers to homeownership page
12, there's a number of barriers to
homeownership in tribal communities,
right? A lot of the big banks
don't operate within
our communities right
now. We are, well, we are funded by
Wells Fargo, but Wells Fargo doesn't do
any hud 184 neither as B of
A or a number of the
other big banks. Right. There are
CD FIS,
but some of the restrictions
set by
Hud. Right. Don't
allow some of the CDC
DFIS to deploy those
programs. So
again, more access
limited CD FIS are really
designed to take on the high risk
deals. But because of
the way the Feds have written the
guidelines, these folks
aren't able to get these out there,
right? Or sometimes
the numbers are too small, right?
USDA,
they're not, they're not, there's not
enough meat on the bone for these, for
these other organizations to
deploy some of these loans
because, you know,
the the lenders aren't going to
make money. So it
limits access to capital even more,
right? A lack of
supporting policies
and, and I want to
kind of take talk about this a little
bit because the
tribes have a lot of work to do.
A lot of the tribes have
to sit down and
they've got to look at these policies,
the issue being
again the history
and the lack of understanding
of how these things work
limits their
capacity to
create effective
policies and
legislation.
Or sometimes they
just don't want to do it because they
don't understand.
Right.
With the coalition, we are
working on a leadership module,
we are putting together
something where
when leadership changes
and there's a new election
that we create a program
that they can come in and we can
teach them within a few days. Hey,
these are the basics. This is what you should
understand. This is how homeownership
works. This is a mortgage,
right? This is what
a lien or, or an
incumbrance on the land looks
like this is marketable title. These are
all things that and, and, and I'll
be honest with you. I, I've sat and I've talked
with council members, I've talked with
presidents with governors.
It's over their heads.
Right. It's a
difficult thing.
Policies and regulations need to
happen. And on the flip side,
the state needs to have reciprocal.
Right. There are some things
that I see that are happening.
For
instance,
in Arizona we have the Arizona
registrar of contractors. They've
taken it upon
themselves
to help regulate
contractors
who essentially
screw up on the reservation.
Right. If they're licensed or
not, there are tribal
members. If they get taken advantage
of by a contractor, there's
no real recourse for them,
especially if that contractor is
non native and they
leave.
Right.
The Arizona registrar of
contractors
is out there
saying, hey, we're here. If somebody
does this, then we can go after
them. I had a
conversation with New Mexico
licenses and
permits and, and
I was told what, unfortunately many
people here, you need to go back
to the rest and they need to figure this out
there. That's outside of our
jurisdiction
that needs to change.
Right? Because
again,
tribal governments are
sovereign nations and not every
single one is the same, there's a lot
of differences. So the way
their, their, their
laws and their policies are
set up are not the same,
they're, they're not the same
everywhere.
It may take a state agency to come
back in and say, hey,
you guys screw these people. We need to make
this right. Right.
As we move forward
with real
estate and opening up
the reservations for these
transactions, we need protections
for our people,
right? We need,
you know, as a, as an
agent, I'm highly regulated,
right. There are a lot of laws that
govern the way that
I do things
fair housing,
right?
As we move on to the
reservation. We're crossing an
invisible barrier where many people
will say that stops there,
our power and our authority
stop at the sovereign nations
borders, right? We need to
make sure that if somebody
does something wrong,
that there's recourse that tribal people
have recourse at the state level,
right? Whether
it's title, whether it's lenders,
whether it's agents,
there's a lot of moving pieces to
this, it's a heavy lift,
right?
Inventory is something else
that we're seeing. And again,
because we're focused at the
80% and above Ami and, and again,
I'm, I'm kind of taking steam out of some of the
other points that I'm gonna talk about
but 80% and
above there
isn't very much
funding.
Now, um
I, I talked to a number of, of,
of different housing
authorities, right?
Uh On Laguna, they're
looking at 325
to $350 a square
foot to build a
house.
If you put that house for
sale at 1500
square feet, three
bedroom, two bath, which is, which
is pretty common. It's over
half a million dollars
that is not affordable
even for somebody who is
at 200% ami
at today's interest rates,
it's not gonna happen.
And so again, we're losing the
missing middle,
right?
So we hear
a lot from our housing
authorities, we need subsidies,
we need build subsidies for
the 80% and above for the
100% for the 150%.
Right. We've talked to housing
New Mexico,
right?
And they're willing to look at this,
right.
We had a meeting with them, which
was, was promising and I don't wanna, I
don't wanna kind of take the fire out
of, out of our meeting, but there's a lot
of things that we discussed and we have to
explore, but
ultimately, we need the
funds, we need the money, we need the
subsidies,
right? The ecosystem.
Again, housing industries don't exist
on the reservation, not like they exist
off, right.
There's a lot behind
uh in ecosystem,
the regulatory, the
policies, uh
the home flippers, the renters,
all of this, none of it
exists on the
reservation.
All right. Pass the homeownership on the
reservation and this is this,
this tends to be a little, a
little singular when we talk
about on reservation because
when we talk about being a homeowner
on the reservation, there are two
options that most tribal people know
of. One is you go to the housing
authority and the other
is you go and you buy a manufactured
home, right?
And that's what most people think or you
or you invite somebody else out and you
build it. Very, very few
people know that you can go out and you can get a
mortgage and you can build a house
on the reservation
even fewer.
Understand that you can
resell a home, you can buy somebody
else's home,
right?
When we did our transactions,
we used Arizona State
uh contracts.
We want to do some New Mexico.
I'm not licensed in New Mexico. So we're
looking for a partner out here to handle some
of these things,
right.
Um There was
a uh, a study and I don't think I
put it in this that talked
about uh, redlining
the reservation, right?
And, and the impact of
manufactured homes and
where those funds go.
Um Hopefully I'll, I'll find a
QR code here by the end of this. But
I'd like to share that with you. It's a good read.
It was done by NCRC,
uh and native community
capital.
All right. So
tribal education. So one of the things
that we do, one of our pillars
is educating the
public. And
again, we're not
providing step three, step four,
step five, we're providing step one,
step two. Ok.
So we're going back to the basics.
This is a mortgage,
the education
systems that exist today
around homeownership at the federal
level and the state level don't
address the
actual tribal issues.
They don't talk about land leases,
right? We don't talk about residential
farm, grazing
permits or those
impacts or what a grazing
official does,
right? All
of that is, is over,
is, is, it doesn't
exist
what we found as we
engaged with other coalitions
from South Dakota,
other coalitions from
Montana, other
organizations out in Oklahoma
or even at the federal level, this isn't
something anybody's tackled
most people are coming in
with the Hud
Certified.
You're learning financial
literacy, you're learning the mortgage,
you're learning all again. Step
345,
right?
Our Homebuyer education
really focuses on
addressing the
history just as I informed you guys,
this is the problem, the
traditional side, right?
The land leases,
right? Construction.
What does that look like? Resale? What
does that look like? Manufactured housing?
What does that look like?
Right. This is the stuff
that we need
for us. It's,
it's it can be
fairly expensive, right?
The travel, the marketing,
getting people to this.
So something we are looking for
uh for this is funding
as well, right?
As we develop this
home Homebuyer education.
And I will tell you every time we do one of these
classes, we figure out, you know what, somebody
asked us something. We didn't, we didn't
realize we were missing that either, right?
So this is an evolving program for us as
well.
Ultimately, what we have
found um
is you don't know what you don't
know, right? Because
of our history, because of any of the things
that existed, we don't
understand. We have
invited many tribal
leaders, council
members, governors,
presidents to these things and, and
unfortunately, we're not seeing
the participation or the engagement
we'd like at the leadership level.
And I will tell you as people
take this class of our, which
is usually about 4 to 5 hours, we're
probably gonna expand it a little
more
many people say I didn't
understand
this. This was never
taught to me. My grandparents didn't
understand this. My aunts and
uncles didn't understand this. And
again, we're talking
about generations,
multiple generations,
never leaving the reservation, who've
never had any experience to this.
And as we bring this on to the
reservation,
they're, they're getting it, they're
understanding,
we're trying to shift the paradigm
around this,
right?
Access to
affordability.
Again, I've got
to really nail home the
subsidies, right.
When we talk about Ami,
that's a huge hindrance for a lot of
people who move back to the reservation.
That Ami is,
tends to be a gatekeeper. For a lot
of folks, you make too much money,
you're above the 80% mark. We
can't help you.
Right?
When we look at affordability, when
a lender looks at it, they're
looking at,
you know, 55%
of your debt to income ratio, we
can make that number move for
you, right? We can
get you qualified at that
number. That
idea of affordability and qualification
changes from the tribe
to getting a lender to do it,
right? The National Housing
Coalition says 30%
of what you make
should be your house payment.
That's where, that's where that number
should be,
right?
Unfortunately,
if a house is half
a million dollars
and you're making
76,000,
you're not gonna make it,
you're not gonna be able to buy into that
community. You're not gonna be able to buy the house on the
reservation, especially at 350
100 square foot, right?
You're not gonna hit the 55%
mark,
right? You're way
over the 30%
housing coalition number
and you're nowhere near the AMI
to qualify for that house.
We need to build subsidies,
right? The pueblos need them
to a nation, the Apache nations
need them.
Now, I will tell
you that
when we were going through this case
study and, and, and we're going through
another, another project
that people
were selling their homes in these
communities,
not on the market, they
were selling a home uh for
around the 30,000
$35,000
mark. Right?
Because there was no
system,
their understanding of what,
where the home value should be. They equated
it to a vehicle. If
my car costed me
35,000, then
five years later, it's gonna be about
15,000. They thought about it in
terms of a, of a, of a depreciating
asset. So say
again,
um, the, this would just
be housing, just housing in
general.
Um,
so
with the, with the concept
of depreciating asset, if
this homeowner bought from the housing
authority, they bought that home
at say $60,000
they're ok with selling that home
at 30 $35,000
when that home should be valued
at 100 and 3500 and 50.
That family lost out on
capitalizing on their equity.
Right? That's a, that's a
tough loss.
And what we find
is there's more and more of that. I
have a very specific
case, uh, where
grandma tried to sell a
house, right?
Somebody, the the homeowner
passed away and his mom tried
to sell the home for
35,000. The kids actually
had to step in and take grandma to court. It was
a very ugly situation.
The kids won
and they sold a home for
375,000.
That's a tough pill to swallow.
Right. But the kids took that
and they, they bought homes, they gave
drama, her money and then they went and they bought
homes of their own.
It's life changing for
them.
All right. Homeownership, affordability
again, builder subsidies.
We, we keep, I'm gonna keep
talking about this. You know,
builder subsidies are important, especially
for market rate, housing, downpayment
assistance, housing, New Mexico,
uh has the DP
A
my conversation with housing
New Mexico is they have
yet and, and, and I may be
incorrect. I may be mis
misstating them, but during
our meeting, they have yet to deploy
a single mortgage
on the reservation in New
Mexico. They haven't
done it yet and they're
chomping at the bit they want to get this done. There
are a number of, of
restrictions that they have that are
state set, right?
Um We are looking at an R and D
project with them, um
where they are able to
allot $100,000 for this,
but we're gonna need a little more than that,
right? If we're gonna do a build sell
model interest rate
buy down, uh which
really helps the affordability
of the home, right?
Another program I
believe, um,
actually, I don't remember, I don't want to quote them
on this, but I believe there might
be an option for an interest rate buy down,
but it's something that allows
for affordability, right, to
bring those monthly payments
down.
All right. So increasing inventory
in tribal communities, the
big one resale, right.
There are a lot of folks who've moved out.
I hear from
community members all the time. That
house has been abandoned.
The the the windows are
boarded up. What are we going
to do with that house resell
it?
Right. I will tell you the
housing authorities because
of the very
strict guidelines are,
are often very
very leery of,
of putting that house
onto the market because they don't want to lose
their funding, right?
It's difficult.
So if a home
is developed using
uh the hoda
funds
and you know, they,
that may, let's say that whole
community is 60% below
AMI and somebody
leaves that area, they're a
homeowner that
home essentially becomes
locked because they
can't get somebody else and maybe that home's
trash, they don't have the funds to do
it. So they end up boarding up the
house right
after the first term,
when they could essentially
pay off the home, put it back on the
market, right? But
again, the
idea and the concept of selling
doesn't exist in many
of these communities,
right? So, uh the
folks who can do this often
don't understand the
mechanisms they need to put in place
or what questions need to be
asked at the federal level,
right?
So resale um it's
gonna be coming into its own, we
are going to be moving. We are
as a nonprofit and the coalition
is going to be pushing more and more
resale, right? We want
families to have access to their
equity. We want to be able to provide
inventory
and, and and homes
for people who are looking to move into
these communities, whether they be working
professionals return veterans, college
graduates or small business owners.
Right? Uh The other option, of
course, the Housing Authority
Housing Authority II I
heard from someone who
had gone to a NABO Housing Authority
meeting and they said there's a 10
year waitlist.
And again, these guys are the
only housing developers in many
tribal communities,
right? We need some
private sector help. We
need contractors, we need
builders, but we need to make
them feel secure because coming
on to the reservation and building on the
reservation is high risk for a lot of
people
buyer homeowner construction
and this is something that is, is,
is becoming uh a little
more popular folks go out, they
get their residential leases, they've got to
get a mortgage, they build a house,
right? But again, we
need supporting policies. We need
those folks. Uh if the
contractor does something wrong, we
need them to be held accountable,
right? Private
development right now,
very, very little private
development. Most most of it happens at
the nonprofit level,
but private development
off the reservation, most
of what we see is private development,
right? That's a big part, a big
chunk of the economy on
the reservation. It almost does
not exist. There are
maybe a couple nonprofits
who, who are out there, but
many folks
don't want to do it. When I
was at the local governance level. I was
trying to convince a local contractor.
Let's build and sell
it can work. You have our
support. They fought me
tooth and nail. Absolutely not.
Absolutely. There's too much risk.
What happens if they don't pay? What happens if it
doesn't sell? What happens if it does
takes too long? What happens if the BI
A doesn't allow the
transaction? Many of
them didn't want
to come and build on the reservation on
that. On that end, we've
got to figure out some solutions
for that. We need more private development,
we need more outside
investment.
All right. So increasing
inventory, private construction.
Um Many of the things that I that I
talked about um
you know, policies, legislation,
uh home buyer representation,
more agents, more folks who
are licensed, more folks who are permitted
and, and even on the
licensing side, can we
provide more
education to these real estate
professionals about how to do these
things on the reservation
Right now.
Most of the real estate policies
and laws are, are kind of written in blood.
People screwed up, people did things
wrong. And so they changed the law around
it essentially,
that's what's gonna have to happen in Indian
country as well. We're gonna
have to move forward.
Mistakes are gonna be made. People
are going to be held accountable, but
we've got to create a system to support
it.
All right. Page 19. Capacity
building. Again, private sector
support. So just like I was saying,
how do we build the ecosystem?
How do we create the industry?
Right? What can the state
do?
All right, sorry guys, I'm running out of time.
Uh I want to give a lot of folks
um time for questions.
I, you know, and, and I had to cut that
up. So I, I had a lot more information
to talk about. But I think
from a support standpoint,
we need funding, we need funding to keep doing
the work that we're doing, right. We
do fall kind of in the gray area,
right? We aren't a certified housing
council. We aren't a CD F
I. We're not building
yet, but
we need funding, we need support. I have
staff, everybody's kind of
moving in the same direction. Uh
And we want to provide more training,
we want to provide more information.
All right, I'm open for questions.
Thank you.
>> Thank you. I have
representative
Dow.
Thank you madam chair and thank you Chris
and doctor doctor for the
presentation. Did you
have something to add
before I ask
questions?
Are you guys printing, >> as you
can see, we're very passionate about this
issue. So
that, that's all I add and
hopefully I'll have some
helpful responses to >> questions.
OK. Thank you. Thank you very much. This is
something that I feel pretty strongly
about and it's, it's
refreshing to see the
state news that
we've been have the cost of housing in New
Mexico has doubled in the last four
years. Construction costs
are skyrocketing.
The regulatory environment is getting
harder, not easier.
Representative Hernandez
and I cosponsor a bill
on archaeological
surveys
because don't you have to have if
you wanted to build a new house on
tribal land today,
archaeological biological
and environmental surveys.
>> Yes, there
are a number of surveys and
depending on the tribe that,
that you've got to go through to get a home site
lease, but you've got to have law clearances.
>> Thank you for that madam chair. And, and
is it the tribe's decision
of whether that's required or
not.
>> Depends if they are hear
or not. If they are a hear
tribe, they can write their
own home site, leasing policies and some
of the requirements. Now there
are some requirements set by
the Feds and I believe
a a and environmental might be one of
those. But beyond that,
I, I believe there are some of those that are
set by the tribe. >> Thank
you. Thank you madam chair. And for that you didn't mention
anything about section
184
are
everybody's using hud
are, are folks using
section 184.
>> There are actually a number
of products that are
available with
within uh you know,
to be used for, for homeownership.
Hud 184 is one of
the oldest, right? It was
started in the nineties. Uh
There are a number of people who
use it, but because of the
way the program, uh
the guidelines are built and the way the
underwriters look at
these programs, the
the they tend to be harder
to approve, right? So
Fannie Mae has a new
um uh
program coming
on which is um
uh oh, I forget heritage one.
I'm sorry. That's Freddie Mac, but there
are conventional loans
that are coming online.
USDA has a
number of other programs as well,
which is the 512,
504. There are actually a number of
USDA programs that, that work as
well. Um And
I, I feel like I'm missing
the veterans native American
direct loan as well is another
program that also works online.
Um People tend to
gravitate towards the 184.
It is usually what we
find is the cheapest option
for folks to get qualified,
the lowest down payment and the lowest closing
costs. But
>> thank you. Thank you madam chair and thanks
Chris for that. And then also
on the,
you said there's only one, the
housing authorities are the only service
providers. So I went on New
Mexico mortgage,
New Mexico Housing Authority
went on their site and they
show other service providers.
Um is
that only for the rehabilitation
and the
only housing authority
is that accurate? I mean,
they can't work with like
commun real or
habitat for communities in,
in, in Santa
Fe shows that they're serving
tribal communities.
Why is it just Housing
authority >> uh manage
chair? Sorry, I forgot to address you.
Um um So
as I said earlier, for
most tribes, it is the
housing authority, right?
So, so they do a
bulk of the heavy lifting
and, and, and honestly,
um
you know,
within these communities,
that's what most people
know. So, so, so Red
Feather develops as well and there's
another sandstone does
development like I said, there are some
out there, but a bulk
of the housing that exists on the
reservation are either manufactured
or done by or built by the
housing authorities. >> All
right. Thank you for that. Um
Also,
um I'm
wondering our
tribes.
I don't, I think everybody on this
committee, madam, chair members of the committee,
I think we want to see
districts
use
extra land for housing
developments. We're
wanting to partner with
cities and
counties to use their
surplus land for housing
development. I think we're, we all
agree. We are
excited about the state land commissioner
saying if you want it
for housing, talk to
us, you, you know
we'll do housing development.
Have you
maps the
land immediately
around the tribal
boundaries and looked
at if any
of that property can be used for
private housing, would
that, is that
something people are open to?
And where's the progress
on that >> madam
chair? So
we don't have the capacity to do
that nor do we have the funding? I
would absolutely love that. And that's actually
been discussed by our board. Can
we create some type
of of resource to do this?
Most tribes
typically will have a realty
office, a land department
or GIS
person within their
community who can do this,
but I will tell you
that tribes are very
guarded with this information.
Um You know, it's
difficult sometimes to
get any type of information
with regard to how they
function, mapping or,
or any, any type of other
personal uh land
leases, right? So off the
reservation, this is all public knowledge you
can go to, you can go to the county website
and you can look through assessor's
page and all of this information is
readily available on the reservation.
It is not and it's closely guarded and
folks don't like to share
that.
>> I would like to add to that
chair, Pinto. Thank you for
the question. Representative Dell.
Uh So there are a lot of
um
jurisdiction that
are across there. I think
if um as we
continue to work with tribal
nations to educate
them on some of these issues
around viewing
land in that
sense of property, right? Because
he touched on traditional
land, there's different
land use and stewardship
that are
traditionally known to tribes.
However, there are federal
jurisdictions that limit
certain things we can do within those
stress areas. And especially,
you know, within New Mexico, there's the
fee lands, a lot of lands,
there's a lot of different jurisdictions we'd
have to deal with. Um, I
think that's something
could be developed
in the future as an
organization. I think it's, it's
something that we're
hoping to work more closely with
tribes on. And, uh,
given that this is like
an introductory type
of presentation.
I hope that in the future
will bring possibly
more information, maybe
a 2nd, 3rd time will come before
you. We're open to meeting
with you one on one to
share more information on that and
how it would look. But I
believe collectively
this would draw
in tribal leaders, community
members and state
level members as well
to address some of these
issues. As you know,
as we continue to look at that
for housing because you know, it's
it's very
complicated.
>> I want to add something to that madam
chair representative
Dow is
that there
are housing
authorities that are looking at
developing off the
reservation. Now,
housing authorities are very
efficient and very effective at building
on the reservation, right? We
don't have building codes
and a lot of but they but they make
do right there. There's no
zoning. Um
Now, as these folks
transition to build off the
reservation, they do need,
they do need training, right? Laguna
housing Pueblo is a perfect example.
They're looking at building uh
homes for
their tribal members within the
Albuquerque corridor.
But going developing on the
reservation is a very,
it's very different than developing
in the city. And as you know, being
in the commercial, you know, having
some history in the commercial
development, you know,
you got to talk to planning,
you've got to get your plans approved,
right? You've got it before, before city
council, a lot of
this I I is
very different
and conflicts with what they know
and how to build. So they need training, they need
to be brought up to speed on how
to do these things, right?
So >> thank
you madam chair and I know we're running behind time.
So I don't want to take up more. I do want to
meet with you guys if I can, I
want to learn and understand some of
these barriers that this may
not be popular. But we
are, we accept
and purchase state
private city,
county municipal, any
municipal. We're happy to
look at property.
We should not say no
just because of who is the
executive. When they
say the Secretary of Interior
says, where do you want
land? How can we
help you build housing? I'm not talking
about a national park.
I'm not talking about a national park. But
for my folks,
I don't care who the executive is
if they've got a block grant that benefits
my community and I can
advocate for it and bring it home, I'm going
to and if there's an
opportunity to have
private ownership
by the transfer of
federal land. I'm not talking about national
Parks. Then I think there's an
opportunity in front of us and
it's worth a conversation with the Secretary
of Interior. And if there
are tribes that are interested in that
owning more land
that can be owned by their
members, I'm,
I'm Cherokee. We
own land.
I, I, I'm, I'm
open to that conversation would be happy
to facilitate it because of
homeownership, generational
wealth and equity is our goal.
Then that's something that I'm I
want to help facilitate.
Um And then when I just want to make sure
I understand who the we is. Who
is we that needs more
money.
Our, our coalition?
Ok. Thank you. Thank you madam
chair and thank you for that. Thank
you. >> I apologize. I
apologize for my laptop
protocol.
>> Thank you. I have Senator
Souls, Representative
Beta Representative
Hernandez and Representative
Royalle, Senator
Souls. >> Thank you
madam chair. And
thank you. This was fascinating and
very enlightening
because we all have
known that there's been a housing problem
and this helps
solidify where it is and
things. But in your opinion,
are the barriers
to, to
ownership on tribal
lands. Is it the tribe?
Is it federal? Is it
state,
is it education of
people? Where are the main
barriers to, to why
we have such a problem?
>> Chair?
So,
Senator,
it's all of the above
it. It's all of it. It's, it's the
education, it's the
way the the money comes
down to the housing authorities.
Um You know,
our our stance
right now is
empowering the community
members. Does that make
sense? Like we want to go in
and make sure that we can put
their ability to
qualify to buy homes
within their hands and at least
give them the knowledge and the
resources where they can do
that. And again, as I was
saying, because the housing
developers are the only,
well, for most tribes
are the largest and
only uh housing
developer, right? They don't
have a lot of options. So
as we go in and we say, hey, you can, you can
build your own house. If you can
qualify, we want to start
putting those pieces in a piece of
the puzzle together, right? The
case study will definitely outline,
I think a lot of this stuff and
it will show that there, there are
solutions, right?
Um But leadership needs
to understand. We've got, we've got to
build an entire system,
right? Um But at the
same time, and
again, we have
to address the traditional,
we have to address that
conflict because
it's, it's difficult to
say, hey, we're gonna run in one
direction, which is unfortunately,
uh what, what
happens? Uh You know, when
folks talk about
modern homeownership.
>> Thank you. We're state
legislators, we don't control
the federal, you know, we don't
control the tribal,
what policies
laws need to change
at the state level that
as an interim committee, we
can advance
forward
and is it
laws or is it
policies that are done under
rule under the various
housing
people?
>> That's kind of a loaded question there.
I mean, there's my, my, my solution
is there's a lot of everything and I think
we almost have to have a separate
conversation with what that
looks like. Right. Uh
There are certain
ways and, and protocols that we
engage with the tribes or leadership,
there's money that needs to go out the
door to create programs.
Uh, you know, and again, like,
like I, I use an example with
the Arizona, uh registrar
of contractors, right? Making
sure people are accountable as we kind of
open this up. There's a lot
of moving pieces to this and, and I
wish I could sit here and,
and, and itemize all this.
But, you know, we'll have, we'll
have to have this conversation offline.
>> Thank you again, you
know, our role is a piece
of this so we can't just
pass a law and make it all
better if the others aren't all
on board. And so, you know, I
realize it's very complex
kind of the last one
you brought up some things about
the grandmother who tried to sell
the house for 30,000 instead of
300,000.
Do we need to have laws to
avoid that kind of
exploitation or
again, is that something that should be
done more and ruled by the
agencies.
>> That's a hard question.
Um, and, and, and, and I say
that
because, because it
happens
everywhere it happens, it's,
it's under the table. You know,
there's no way to regulate it. There's
no way to figure it out till after
it's happened. Um, I
personally would love to see
some type of policy
regulation that stops
this. Uh
But, you know,
it, again, there's, there's gonna be a
lot of conflict, there's gonna be fights of this
on both sides. So I don't think there's a clear
answer to that. And >> if we could do
that, I don't think we would have
a situation right
now.
Senator Representative
A beta. Thank >> you madam
chair. Thank you, Mr Billy and Doctor
Cook for your presentation.
I definitely see your passion
and thank you for all the information you
shared. Um Just a quick
background. I live on
a one acre homesite
lease that's on
CBN land
with a scattered
home project.
So just that is
loaded in itself. My
mortgage will be paid off in
October.
Yes. And that's
huge. And there's only three
houses like that in my community.
So I'm super blessed because
it just doesn't happen for
people in my community.
Um So I this is my
language here growing up.
This is everything I've
been around my whole life.
But when you talk about a mortgage in
the city or, or lending
or those things, I will be very
lost. I don't know that system, I
know this other system that
you're talking about.
Um What I do want
to share is I've
been looking for solutions for this
because all my communities
in my district are having housing
issues and there's multiple
jurisdictions as
you heard me say earlier,
Pueblo Navajo
and land
grant and then county
and then grant and Milan very
different.
>> One of the things I
wanna um pledge
now is my support for number
one where you're wanting dedicated
funding for homeowner
education and financial
literacy training and workforce
programs. I think that's, that's
very important. And this
is the reason why I want to say when
we were in Toach, we heard
from the clubs program when
we were in Pinedale, we heard from
Klese as well. These
are the tribal
um or committees
that are tasked with
divvying up what the,
where land
is in their community, how
it will be used and what they can
do. My husband and I
came up with an idea for micro
communities where
if you take a, let's see,
what's an example, a small
block of a neighborhood and
you divvy up those properties.
Perhaps the state could help
with infrastructure for those
areas. But the community
would have to be willing to let
people lease or
get those tracks of
property. So what I'm getting
to is in my
community, we are so
close to Albuquerque, but
yet my community
members are territorial.
They do not want
outsiders to come in, they do
not want other people to come
in. Um If
you're not from there and you can't
prove that you have an original
ancestor from
there. You
are not welcome.
It don't matter if you vote
there. Uh It
is just so
sad and so
that's why I want to start with
number one here and support that
because I think if you can get
into the high schools
and the middle schools and talk about
this early on, we could
change a lot of those
perspectives. I do
want to see um
housing communities
pop up here and there, even
veterans housing
communities that,
that would be huge. And I know
there are some people who are willing
to pay for their houses. But
you also have communities
that have a mindset of
it's owed to them. So
I applaud your work. Both of you.
It's a tough industry to be
in, but you provided a lot of
helpful information today. Uh
One last quick story
when I was fresh out of high school,
my aunt
offered to have
me buy her NH A
house that was paid off for
40,000. And I thought,
where am I going to get 40,000
to this day? I'm mad at myself
that I, I couldn't at
least call someone and say, how do I
apply for a loan?
Because that could have
been my first house. And that was a
long time ago. Now, if
those people were to resell that
house, it'd be similar to
this, but I do
support you. I want to help with that
number one homeowner
education, but just
also I'm interested to
know if you're doing any
work with clep C programs
on tri in tribal communities
to talk about where can
these, these
um
spaces for
home building take place?
And is the infrastructure there? Because
I feel like that's what we can help
with, but that's
it. I maybe I'm
wrong there, but that's where I feel
like an immediate help could be.
Thank you
>> madam chair. Thank
you.
What you described
as, as the
community not
wanting folks to come in.
Unfortunately,
that is more and more
common throughout Indian country,
uh, even in Navajo
where, where, you know, we're
all Nava, they don't want outsiders coming
in. Right? And, and we hear this at
the community meetings and
education is, is going to be
the best, the best tool that we can
use. Right? Because folks
have an idea of this person
is going to come in and room, my community, they're gonna
drink, they're gonna bring crime, they're gonna do all these things,
which is the exact opposite,
right? Because applying and
getting a proof for mortgage is very
difficult, right? You've got to have your
credit together, you have to do all these things. So the people you're
inviting into your community are
gonna help your community versus
bring it down. And we have to kind of
pull that stigma out.
Um with regard to
micro communities, there are
communities that are doing
this and, you know, folks down
in, in Arizona and some of
Pima, um they are
creating these, these smaller
hubs, they're, they're effective,
right? So I think that's absolutely
an option and something we can
look at. Um what
was the other item
that and club
c so uh club
c at this point, we haven't.
The only one that I've engaged is the one
from Upper Fruitland and we've only
engaged them because they have a housing
moratorium set within their
community. We were looking at
how can we actually remove that
Upper Fruitland is a highly desirable
place to to, to live, folks
want to move there because it's, it's
proximity to, to
Farmington, but they've got it locked
down and the community wants it removed.
So we were actually going in to try
help them, but they just, they don't have the
funding, right. Um
So, so as of right
now, um we
had originally talked about
creating AAA
section for when
they have the election cycles with the
chapters because the chapters typically they'll
go out and they'll do a week of, of
leadership. We want to be able
to, to come into that, maybe
provide a couple of hours and
educate folks on how this works.
And then if it filters down the club c,
we could do something like that as well.
>> Thank you madam chair. Just in
closing, I invite you to come to
my community and meet my club
c members or connect by
Zoom. I'm hopeful that
in through education, my
community will open up
to, to people moving
because we're so close to Albuquerque
and it's a great resource.
Thank
you.
>> Thank you chair and just
to um Senator
Souls and
Representative Beta. Thank you so
much for your questions
and your response. Uh
We'll certainly
be in touch and follow up with
your office. I also want to put
out there, you know, to your
questions. There are some research
that we are currently doing and
we certainly can provide some of that
information and hopefully
best answer your
question. Um not
right now, but at a later date.
And also we are working on
a white paper for real estate
as it applies to
navigation specifically.
And then of course from there, I think we'll
branch out to other charts, but that's
certainly something I think she touched
on, on the real estate issue.
So those are
forthcoming and I'll
be happy to follow up with
their, with their offices.
Thank
you,
>> Representative
Hernandez.
Thank you madam chair and
uh good to see you again,
Mr Beley and doctor
uh Kirk Kirk Cook.
Uh I appreciate the
uh education
uh outreach in
Shiprock. Uh
That was really amazing
to see uh your,
your team in action.
And um I'm sorry, I
didn't get to
go through all the
modules that you guys had,
but um I'm, I'm glad I, I was
able to, to see that happen
the um on the
ground uh work
that you guys are doing. I
think it's really critical
and important to
continue that
education uh
with
community. Uh I
want to go off the
reservation.
Uh My family uh
madam chair. Uh We
have a individual
Indian allotment
in Eastern Agency of the,
of the Navajo Nation.
And so just
south of NAGI
uh
um the, the
allotments are a different
status than
tribal.
Um Have, have you guys
had any experience working
madam chair, uh
working with
Indian
allotments,
>> madam chair. Um
Allotments are tricky.
We, we've kind of
watched them more from a distance.
We watched the lenders. I, I will
tell you lenders don't
like touching allotments
because of the, the
fractured nature of, of the
interests, right? And
typically to encumber
an allotment, you've got to get
100% agreement and, and
most of the time you can't get that
right. So, so it
stifles uh
home building within
allotments. Um
You know, if you can get that down,
I, I don't know, I think there's, there's some
pieces that you can put in
place. Um
But, you know, again, it's, it's,
it's really just R and D work
and sitting down with the bi A and, and kind
of fleshing things out, but that's,
that's a whole another asking
itself. >> Thank
you madam chair. I must be the
lucky family
that seems to always
have an agreement on,
on, on stuff with our
allotment. Um
uh madam chair,
um, uh Mr
Billy. Uh
I, uh, I,
I'm glad that, uh,
um, you brought to
us, uh
areas of where we can
support you guys.
Um, and I do agree
with, uh, you know, the
first item uh that
my, my colleague has
mentioned,
um,
when,
when it comes to,
um,
the,
uh,
what, what,
um,
what I really like, uh is,
is like, like
seeing
the reality of,
of, of, of this happening.
Um And I didn't
know about um
the purchase of, of
homeownership on Navajo
until I, I underst I
understood about the
Kerrigan
estates
that's in Saint
Michael's Arizona.
Um
Is, is there
um
like any type
of listing? I'm really
glad to hear about the,
the, the um
zone. I, I think zonings,
I think where, where I'm trying to
get to in my question
um
with, with the
uh madam
chair. Uh Mr Really? Do,
do you agree that
um that
to, to get around some of
this, we would need
to have zoning
in these
communities,
>> madam chair
representative.
Uh
because there are
no building
codes, there's no impact. There's no,
there's no, a
lot of times proper planning
done.
>> I wouldn't say there's no
building codes because I know we
put money to do ad a
to have upgrades
to those like the chapter
houses. So
kinda because if
they're going to provide a service,
I think we're requiring some of
that. So, so >> madam chair, thank you for that
comment, madam chair.
Um, now the
money, if it goes
to the chapter, the
chapter by
the, the, the regulations
of the funds coming in have to
adhere to building codes. The
community itself
typically will not have
building codes. So in order
to meet the funding requirement,
they'll, they'll go through, they'll bring an inspector,
make sure that it was done as part of as,
as, as part of their
clearance.
Um, Overall,
uh zoning is vital
and important, right?
But getting the communities
to do it is a whole different
beast in itself
because sometimes what
happens is, uh
you know, hey, this
person's lived in this area
and now it's zoned for
multifamily and they're gonna
fight at the chapter level to not
bring these folks and not in my backyard,
right? It happens, it happens
within tribal communities. The other
side of this is as, as I'm
experiencing with, let's say Upper
Fruitland Chapter, they just don't have the
funds to do it. They don't have the funds to
bring in a planner and
actually do the zoning and
get the art GIS models.
Um You know, and that happens
in a lot and some folks don't see
the necessity behind it. Why should
we do zoning? We're already building,
there is already a road here, there's
already infrastructure. So
again, I think an education piece
on the development side. So one of the
items that we talked about was,
was the training, right? For,
for folks that needs
to be everywhere.
Club. See the, you know, the
the the the president's governors, everyone
else needs that.
Thank you madam chair.
>> Thank you madam madam
chair. And so with
funding, uh you
guys will be able to do
more outreach to the
club seats. Is that what I'm
hearing
>> madam chair? Yes, absolutely.
>> Thank you madam chair.
I again, I
think when we talk about
economic development.
Um
Well, my
last question is, are,
are you guys also considering
other than
uh I I know that there's a strong
need for family, family
housing?
Um
What about workforce
housing?
>> Thank you madam chair. Um
Workforce housing is absolute
necessity, right? That that's
something that we we also
need. Um
you know, Navajo, I know it
has had a huge focus
on workforce housing, especially in and around
the Winner Rock Corridor
for us. I
think the capacity right
now is really more
for families if we
had more staff. I think that's something
that, that, that we could do. Um
We just don't have the capacity to
to chase workforce housing right
now. >> Thank you madam
chair. Thank you madam chair. That concludes
my questions and urge the
>> support.
Thank you, Representative
Representative Rob
Caballero.
>> Thank you madam chair and thank you
very much. Nice to see you
again. I I
have a couple of questions
but I wanna and thank you for all your
work. Um
affordable housing is
has been, I'm
retired now, but was my
career.
So I'm very
interested in in
ensuring that we
keep the affordable
in,
in, in the housing
across the board
for all the reasons that you
described in your
presentation.
So, um
but what if
if my first
question, just out of curiosity
to see if, how we can
be of assistance
if the state is going to,
if New Mexico is
going to assist
and you provided
several different areas
and particularly page
20 on
the uh New
Mexico tribal homeownership
support. How would
we do so,
uh providing
funding
without violating
anti donation laws of
New
Mexico?
>> So let
me, so when
Senator Rodriguez
was with N
MA
and a lot of some of the
funding that came through
that we put in kind
of like that I'm aware of
after I came into
office
that we did have
and tribal
housing that they were able to
qualify for these
upgrades. If there was a
weatherization that we were
going to fund there,
that they were able to apply
for whether their house was on
or off the reservation
if they were tribal
people.
But I think that was the other
piece. I thought we put
money in there for
um education
in that and, but it flows
all of that kind of just flows
through NM fa but my
expert, Senator Rodriguez
is not here anymore. So
I think some of that too, we,
we can ask N ma
to
because of this, they're the
ones that recommended these guys to
come to us. So they're very aware
of them and that's where we put a
lot of it. And like I said,
my experts not here,
but there are some things,
some aspects that you guys talked
about. But
with Senator, I think she really
had an idea,
especially working with
former Senator Pinto
about all these barriers
that are in
this and I'm very aware
of it. But go ahead.
>> That would be something
that we would have to look at because
we would be giving funds
directly to. Now
how if there's precedent
sent, then, then
that's helpful. We, we also,
that would be part of the research would
have to know how they got
around that because
that will be something that
um if
I mean, we the the will is
here. Um The
question is getting through that.
So that was my one
question going
back to your page 10
on the area median
income discussion
page 10 and 11.
Um,
do you know, or
can you gather the information
about how many qualified
tribal homebuyers
are actually
excluded
due to the
ami indicators?
And, well, I have
a second part of
that.
>> Thank you madam chair. Um
That data is very difficult
to come by. We are currently
running AAA
survey right
now to try to at least
get us a glimpse of that.
But it it's it's
difficult simply because
we don't know when they leave,
right? The only time that the
only reason I know that that they
were there in the first place is we
tried to sell and then they came to us, we
had these conversations, right?
Uh And then when we started to see
them move and we heard a lot of these
stories, right? And then we
hear them from other folks um
capturing the data is, is a
little elusive. Thank you madam
chair.
>> Thank you madam chair. I just want
to add to that. Um
As you may know, there's
a lot of research that is still
needed data that still needs
to be collected that
really hones in on these
um unique
variables that affect tribal
nations. And I think that's one of the reasons
why I was brought on with
my research background and in my
phd and
also with
that survey, there
are potentially other research
questions and areas
we can target in the future
as we continue to expand out.
So, thank you so much for
that. That is
something we don't
necessarily
fully cover. But I think there's
some areas that we are targeting
right now to build up to
that. >> Thank
you. And I think that goes back
madam chair to our
overall concern about
how poverty
impacts um
our ability. So we
that research is really important
because we need to know what levels
of
poverty we
need to
address
poverty as a whole.
But what are the obstacles
directly affecting? What are the
indicators telling us?
Thank you that on that.
Going back to your
page nine on the missing
middle,
I
what what
financing or
more mortgage products
could actually close
the missing middle
gap that
you are aware
of.
>> Thank you madam chair. Um
There are a number of
of of mortgage products.
Um It's just, it's getting the building
costs down, right?
Um There, there is
uh Freddie Mac
heritage one, there
is the
USDA
uh
502,
the guaranteed lending, I
think the 512,
there's a self build as well.
Um There is also
the Veterans Native American
Direct Loan. Uh
Then there is the hud
184 Indian home
loan as well. So, so there are
a number of products uh
but unfortunately not every
single one is deployed in every
situation.
Thank you, madam chair. >> Thank
you madam chair. And even in those
products,
there, there
is underlying
still existent
redlining
aspects to all
of that that we have to
pay very careful attention
to. Although that
pertains to certain
areas,
certain,
I mean populated areas where
housing development is going to go
up.
So
are you aware of
any um that
are specifically
designed
for
um tribal
develop? I mean for development
on tribal reservations
that are specific,
that would avoid
the natural
barriers or exclusionary
factors that are involved in
the ones that you named?
Because it's been very hard
to even just get
general um
assistance from Freddie
Mac and all the ones that
you um
identified. I think we have to
get a little bit
creative.
>> Thank you madam chair. I'm
not sure I understand
the question. So
are you asking what
product can we use to
develop on the
reservation?
>> That's exactly where I'm going
to is exactly
what can we create
or support in
backing mortgage
products or down payment
assistance program
specifically
for reservation land
transactions? And
that's where I'm
getting. >> All right.
Thank you madam chair. Um So
there's a few different
ways to look at this.
Um The, the
180 there is 100 184
where you can use and, and,
and go into subdivision to create
subdivision. However, that
product is only available
to tribal entities.
So housing authorities can use
those as far as private development,
private developers don't
like to step foot on the reservation
because again, there's too much risk,
right? Um There
are some solutions to
this one is creating AAA
mutual fund or
some type of large trust
fund that we can use
as you know, backing to,
to secure and at least
make the developer feel good, right? So
as we kind of go through these sales,
um the the other piece again
is, is, is, is the build cost,
got to get this down to where people
can afford things and
that is subsidies, right? Or that's
negotiation, what we have
found uh sometimes is
they're not, there's not a lot of negotiating
happening. Um And, and
that's either due to native preference
or that's due to terror laws.
Um You know, when I know, I know when
I was with my, my home
community and
we were developing or, or at
least trying to negotiate
products, we didn't have a lot of
options, right? We could
go with this guy who had his native
cert or this person who was taro
and their, their pricing, they all understood
how to work the system. So trying to bring those
prices, that was very difficult.
And so, and so when we talk
about opening this up to private, we need
more competition because we know
competition drives down
price. Thank you madam
chair. >> I think that thank
you madam chair and thank you,
I think the objective would be
or, or the
mindset that we
have been
talking about for years
and generations
is
tribal self-determination
and ownership and tribal
sovereignty. So the whole
idea is for
tribal tribes,
nations and pueblos
to own
all of this
development. And so
the objective would be to
seek out or
create and, and you're
correct. And several
conferences that I've
attended that have zeroed in on
tribal
tribal related matters,
talk about
owning and the trust
of funds and
different mechanisms that
can be set
up modeled and
used for all of
our um
entity. So I would strongly
encourage you to go
in that direction
and, and help the
tribes nations and pueblos
move in that direction.
>> Thank you madam chair. So, so one
caveat to that now
mo going through and, and
being and going through
the history that I, that I've gone
through
empowering the people
and giving them the tools
to, to
build these themselves
or their own industries.
Um is, is
from, at least from my standpoint
is a big part of this
puzzle, right?
Um On
Navajo, the home
site leasing policy says you can
only have one property at a
time. But I have
met folks who are
home flippers. I have met
folks who have rentals
and they are kind of moving in
between the cracks and the policies
to make this happen.
Right. So those
folks understand the
system, they are still providing a
service. But if we were to
take it to the council and identify
who these people are, they would kind of be shunned.
But we need to embrace
some of these aspects of
people wanting to do these things on
their own. There are contractors who want
to go in and renovate some of these houses
and put them back on the market. They're all
part, they're all parts of this
industry. They're all parts of this puzzle,
right? Thank you madam
chair >> and
thank you for that and, and
just not to beleaguer the
point, but those need
to be owned and
operated
and implemented
by our people
in order for it to
get the buy-in
that and support from
our, from our communities.
One last question I have
and this is for Doctor
Clark Cook.
Um
And thank you for the um
the
handout
I was reading through
and um looking
at your challenges
and one
area was the whole
master lease.
So I'm wondering what
specific
Navajo nation or
federal regulations
remain the
most significant
obstacles to
converting master
lease properties to
home site leases?
And then how quickly
could these be amended
without undermining
the sovereignty
if that is
the major
consideration,
>> madam Chair
Representative
Karar. Thank
you. Thank
you.
I apologize too. I have
allergies. So I there's a
little
raspy.
Honestly, I this
may be an
educated opinion
but I would say the
main barrier
is grazing permits
specific to
Navajo Nation.
It has become
a uh a
known
fact unquote
that increasing
permits, increasing
permittee permissions
to even build or set
aside land has
stopped multimillion
dollar projects in its
tracks before
it's even begun. Let's say
organization does have
funding already.
They already have, let's say $10
million to build
and that the community
supports it. And then there's
just one grazing
permit that is not
approved and it stops the whole
thing. So
that would be
my
educated guests and I'm
sure
Mr Billy may have another
one, >> right,
madam chair
representative. So
um with the master lease
issue, this master
lease issue within the housing authority
has been going on for decades
and it was
really a policy of
transition, right? How do we transition
these properties? And when
I had engaged
with then Maureen
Curly, who was the CEO
of NH A at the time when we started
this project, she was on
board to make the correction
right? To get these folks who paid
off their homes and then to get
them converted. After
engaging with the NH A
board, the biggest concern
they had is is what happens to
the streets. What happens to the infrastructure
because it's a master lease that
still falls under our jurisdiction if we
turn them over, who takes care of those,
those items, right?
I have suggested a
number of things including creating
an H A creating
a maintenance
fund that people pay
into. But
ultimately, the the
policy uh
with the housing authority needs to
change. And, and from my
understanding, after talking
to the land department and the resources
development department
head, Mia uh it,
it's a policy shift and it's a policy
shift that needs to happen within the
housing authority, right?
Um There, there
are a number of
folks who are kind of stuck
in this master lease issue because a master
lease is not a marketable
title. So as these
folks pay off their homes,
they want to move, they want to go somewhere
else as a job offer, but they
can't do that because they can't sell their
home. They can't cash on the
equity. Thank
you.
>> Thank you madam chair. There
are a lot of things we
have to overcome a
lot of challenges, but we're
moving in the right direction. So I
appreciate it. Thank you very much.
Thank you madam chair. That's
it. Thank you,
representative little.
>> Thank you madam chair.
I'll try to make
this as brief as I can.
And um uh
if you have a
response, I'd ask you, I'm sure
madam chair, we would all appreciate a
brief response as well.
Um But I do
appreciate your
um Mr
Billy and Doctor
Cook, your
presentation today. It's
highlighted an issue
in certain,
in uh specific
um uh
communities
that face these
issues and have
a different uh
because of their sovereign status,
determine how they want to
deal with these issues.
So, um working
with, um I'm
curious as to,
as you laid out the
issue. Uh madam
chair,
um
you commented
on this is
about homeownership,
I mean a land ownership
and for the pueblos,
I'm wondering uh madam
chair, if you've had an opportunity
to speak with some of the pueblos who
are traditional forms of
government, where lands
are actually held in
common, they are
not owned
per se. And there,
there is a,
there are mechanisms in
place by which
communities
do establish
uh uh
land
um that's provided for
housing or whatever
purpose that that the owner
is looking for or that the person is
looking for.
And madam chair they do
recognize um
I was raised in San
Felipe Pueblo and
as you have come north
uh on I 25 you
will see the housing
development that has come
my question
to you or actually maybe an
offer. Um
My question first is if you've
to ask us if, if you've
had an opportunity
to speak
with Isaac
Pettis, um
who uh
oversees the
San Felipe Housing
Authority,
>> I
chair. Thank you. Yes. So I have spoke with
Isaac, I spoke with a couple of years
ago and, and uh on
occasion, I'll run into him at conferences.
Um I think
that what San
Felipe and Isaac have done are,
are definitely a
benchmark for how
folks should be developing,
right? Uh They were able to
keep the cost down and their goal is
100% homeownership
and they're very well on
their way to doing that. Um
There are a few things that
they've done that are that
we're seeing now, some of the other
pueblos that they're partnering with like
Hamus, they're, they're kind
of working around this.
Um There are a few things
that, that they need help with workforce
development is one of them,
right? Um And, and we
understand the system that they're kind of
implementing, it's, it's,
I think it's a little more difficult for us to
take it to a larger scale because they're
working on discounts working with Big
Box. Right? Some of the, some
of the issues we see with cost
sometimes comes down to
the housing authority having
to, to
uh oblige or, or,
or um implement
uh taro or
uh native preference and sometimes
that tends to keep the, the, the,
you know, where do they get? The building materials
keeps the cost high? Whereas
Isaac's not looking at that, right? So
they're, or, or ha some of
the young Pueblos who are working with folks like Home
Depot with lows and they're able to get
those costs down. Um
So does that answer
your question?
And,
and so the other, the other
portion of that is, is we have
engaged with a couple
of Pueblo leaders, council
folks. And I
think the, the, the
thinking is around
the traditional, around the
older villages. Those
are essentially off limits right?
Outside of that, we can
look at uh can
we find lands elsewhere, can we
develop some of these other things, things
that are a little more modern? Uh
We, we can work on
implementation in, in some
of those arenas. Uh But
then it, but then it comes down
to who are the gatekeepers
who, who's in the realty department, are
they willing to, to work with
us and actually move forward?
And it comes back
to there's a traditional
line of thinking with some of these folks
and they don't want to move on some of these
items. So, thank you, madam
chair. Thank you representative.
Thank >> you madam chair.
I would
actually
actually state
only. I've
been a tribal administrator
as well. And so working
with tribes
and learning
about all the differences they
have uh and
their sovereign status and
it is their
under their
purview as you
know, to create the
policies to develop
the changes to their,
to their
um
areas like like
zoning, uh not every
community has that it does
not mean however,
that they don't have that
established. So,
um I think
that my sense
is that with the
Pueblo of San Felipe's
success in
establishing those housing
and development areas
that there have been
other tribes, other
Pueblos, much like
San Felipe, more
traditional
and with a limited
land base
that have been
able to access
the experience
of the Pueblo
and work
with them to try to
replicate this. And
we've been seeing this happening
and I'm very happy to
see that James and Santa Anna
are doing the same
Santa Clara such
that they also
have the
AO construction team
from there, Oking
as well. And
Sanli is
known that our
people are known for their
abilities in
construction and
everything from the
foundations up to
the up to the
roof. And I'm very
proud of that. So I think
that that's an example
that might be
helpful. Uh
They've learned more things
along the way and
it's been my
um uh
observation madam chair
that, that information
is willing to be shared to the
extent that it's possible.
But I think that they are also
refining
how
uh as the numbers
become larger, the
economies of scale can
be used
to actually get even more
uh take advantage of more
opportunities to build
more homes. So madam chair
with that, um I think
that's, that's all I have. I'm happy
to talk with you offline and,
and um in, in a
little bit
more in depth. Thank
you madam >> chair. Just
one real quick. Thank you madam
chair,
representative little. So,
uh initially when I started this, I
talked about a, a
project that I did back in
0304 and
that very system
that I was working to define
and figure out is something
that Isaac has almost
perfected, right? And
we can work under our own power. We
have our craftsmen or tradesmen. Everything
else. The, the
issue that we
have found recently is
we don't have enough tradesmen,
we don't have enough folks who are
trades. So we're trying to connect the
dots right now with
folks who need that with the, with
the workforce developers, with
the, with the, you know, NTU
is, is got a trades
program that they're, they're dialing
it in right now. How can we
connect everybody? Right?
So, thank you madam
chair.
>> Thank you. Representative little
Representative
Zamora.
>> Thank you madam chair and
thank you presenters.
So there's a
Pueblo between
Espanola
and
a BCU that we went
to and they had some new
housing. They toured us through the houses
and stuff. I don't remember the name of the
Pueblo.
But are you
aware of that
housing?
>> There's a will. There's a way and
I believe that was MS Sclero. They
had the 40 units that
were about done with
the like a modular
homes.
Um Yeah, and
it was like a halfacre
lot. It was in the
mountains because I
don't know, >> there's one over here.
We have >> to,
it,
>> I don't remember
the, >> this
year
>> about a year ago
and I was wondering how that was
going and, and I know
they had three or four
new homes built
and this one particular
home was built to
spec and
they were going to sell it like for 100 and
50,000 at maybe
0%
interest.
Uh
So I was wondering if
you're aware of that project that's
going on there and how it's going?
Thank >> you, madam chair, Representative
Zamora. I'm not actually.
So we, we do
outreach the number of folks, but
we only engage those folks who call us
back. And unfortunately, I don't
think we've been able to engage with.
Uh III I know we
talked about starts with the t uh with
the Pueblo out in that area.
And uh
is, is it Zia
Tete Suki. That's, that's, I think
that's, yeah. So I haven't, I haven't, we haven't
been able to connect with them yet.
>> Maybe it was, but it, it
was very interesting what they had going
there and, and, and things were
working, seem like and they,
they were planning to build more
homes. So I
found that one very interesting.
Uh Is
there any madam chair and and
presenter? Is there any private
money allowed
to be invested in the
reservation
or, or
natives? And, and,
and >> well,
let me clarify to
one of the things. When we
talk about reservations,
each Pueblo tribe and nation
has their own
because I can speak
with for, for Navajo
nation for when you talk
about private coming in.
Um But you have to be a certified
contractor, you have
to be approved by the
tribe with
Navajo Nation and have some
kind of file. That's why they're running into
the stuff with C homes.
So each one's different,
I'll just say,
>> ok, and then, and then
my next question, madam chair
and the
presenters
can a a private
person buy a
home on
a reservation on Indian
land
>> chair representative bore
it depends on the tribe,
right? So, so the
tribe has the ability
as a sovereign nation
to, to allow these
folks to come on. So na o for
instance, will allow
those folks who serve the community
to get a home site lease,
right? And if we start talking
about some of the Colorado River
Indian tribes. They are allowing
nonnatives to come on to their lands. But
it's really ultimately up to the tribe, which
I don't think there's a pueblo that I know
of. That allows a non
pueblo member to come on to the tribe,
right? Or same thing with a PCI
Navajo. I know does
have the
the public service
or allowances.
Um But, but ultimately, it's up to
the tribe. Thank you madam
chair. >> So,
so
>> just to add really quick
specific example
in TBA city, there are a
lot of lands that are owned
by nonnatives in that area.
So they have a trailer
park that they rent out
and that's actually owned by a
non-native, but that
land is not trust land. So
technically it's within
Nava Nation but it's
not NAO nation
land.
>> Yeah.
So this this thing gets pretty
complicated when you, when you look
at it across the
board.
Thank you madam chair. I I
believe my
my coworker here
is, is uh looking
at the lunch table back
and I won't ask any more questions,
>> madam chair. Actually, I have one,
I have one caveat. We always, we
always welcome private
development, right? We want private
developers in Indian
country. The problem is, is
the way they look at this. The risk
is too high, right?
There's no recourse within the tribal
courts. There's no recourse for them within the state
courts to, to, to recoup their
capital or losses if
something goes sideways.
Um So trying to create
those, those safeties
is difficult. Thank
you madam chair and, and again, madam chair, I, I
do apologize for going over
time and, and, and you
know, so,
so thank you so much to the committee. I
appreciate it. >> I think they
think it's an easy task,
but I've been
built homes, been through the
process of buying home off
of the.
We do have a lot.
We do have grazing
permit, people that I know
and several in the family. So
all of those
things,
Navajo Nation is not very
easy based on
simple and
all of this is there.
But even with hud, they have
to have a plan, even the cscs
have to have a plan
to get those
fundings.
You have to have approval, be
certified to do
that construction. And even
actually last week there
was people doing
some, I think Power
Line work out there
that was contracted
through the
NTU A and
they were threatened by
grazing permit holder out
there. Um
pretty bad. So,
um getting that
also out there in the liability of
these companies that come out and
think they could do that work out
there without having the
risk is very interesting,
especially when we talk about our young
people that
are employed by them
and also also Navajo,
but they're threatened too out
there
that master lease, we
can't even do a master
mou with our capital outlay
with Navajo nation. So
that's a whole another
thing. But allotment land is a very
different thing because we do have
the issues with the burials that are
occurring out there and the
home site leases that exist
and with those probates that
exist that used to
be all fractured. But now my
understanding to fix on that
was that the eldest
person of that
family would hold that allotment.
Now, which really
changes dynamic of
the family, especially
when will you grandfather that
in some of these entities
of the alcohol distribution
places on the reservations
in there? Those lands
were actually given
way ahead of time. There's
almost no way to get them off
because of however it was
structured,
you guys were out until Hatchie
and I think some of you that were
around me, you
see all that land, but most
of it has been leased, there's
homesite leases that already exist
that people have not built
on, but it's been leased
out. So when you try to
do zoning, there's
already things that preexist in
that sense. We have the different
statuses of the chapters,
even with the
528.
Lucky with Nabo
Nash Chitty chapter,
they're actually exploring the Zon
and actually got land set
aside for
development and trying to
develop along the
highway.
And when you talk about qualifying
for a loan, we have a lot of
single parents out there. So
that median income of
missing they
can't qualify a loan.
And even in that,
walking through the process off
the land, you have to have a cosigner
that's qualified too.
Back in the day. I think you needed
actually a $20,000
down payment to qualify for
the federal loans, which
are, people do not have that
money in their pocket.
Um, I was very fortunate
because my grandparents,
um, having that
equity and
actually I think their lot in
Gallup was like $500
back in the day.
Um So they
slowly paid on that and
were able to have
homeownership off the
reservation in Gallup,
but it
is not an easy
process to find
people to
and that, that's just a generation
for me. Um
So this thing is very new when
you talk about gathering the
data, it almost
does not exist in some
sense as they gather it or
who's out there
um encompassing
it and those approvals with the debt
to income ratio,
you just buy a vehicle and
that can set you,
you won't qualify
because you're, you're, you're
financing your vehicle
and even your parents are financing
their vehicles. Um We get
to the point where they just become too
old. They will not finance
them the retirement
income in that sense too.
We have that generation that
has that
financial
security in some sense,
but with inflation that does
does hurt it. So
it is
a lot to do out
there and most of it if
there's a will, you
will find a way, put a new
roof or find a way to
help them within your family
in that sense. So,
but thank you, thank you for the
information and I hope
I didn't really discourage it, but
those are a lot of
things just with Navajo
Nation that I have to go with. But
thank you and we
will go to lunch.
Go ahead and cut the webcast.
I can make an announcement
but we will go and recess tell.
