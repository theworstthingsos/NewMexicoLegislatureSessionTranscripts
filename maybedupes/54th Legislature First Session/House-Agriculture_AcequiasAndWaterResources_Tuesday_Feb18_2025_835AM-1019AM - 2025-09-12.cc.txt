And
the
substantially improving
And
the
substantially
increase in. It's it's our
existing laws are being
sufficiently upheld
and some of those stated before,
we ask you to please issue a due
pass for House Bill 348. Thank
you.
Morning, Madam Chair. Committee
members, uh, DL Sanders, I'm a
water lawyer. I had Nat's job
for like 14 years. I was a data
engineer for 24 years. I can
tell you that these penalties
probably aren't enough.
Because of the same bad actors I
think I I'm guessing that by the
same bad actors that were there
when I was there, and the $100 a
day did not.
Uh
Was not worth the incentive the
customer state more to go out
and try to enforce that against
somebody. This may not even be
enough because they make so much
money off of that water right
now. Um, and we do that because
we, we keep track of it. Is a
jail in New Mexico, Las Vegas,
New Mexico, and other
butterigation district. I don't
speak on their behalf, but we
do, we're saying I'm aware of
he's over divergins and this is
a good bill.
Thank you.
Anyone else in the audience and
support?
Anyone in opposition.
Madam Chairwoman, committee
members, my name is Tom
Patterson. I serve as
president-elect, the New Mexico
Cattle Growers Association. When
we first saw a draft of this
bill last fall, we were alarmed
at the penalties. They could
have easily wiped out rag
producers as filed, however.
The bill now includes section 1E
that limits the application of
those penalties, the situations
other than the over diversion of
water. We appreciate that
change. We also asked the OSC
for confirmation that uh they
won't pursue relief under
sections 2 and 3 for such over
diversions, they've assured us
that those provisions won't
apply. We still cringe at the
penalties provision. We've heard
no convincing logic or basis for
tying them to section, uh.
One eye, ie section one eye to
the CPI.
Permit fees perhaps, penalties,
no.
That precedent of tying
penalties to the CPR is our
remaining objection. Thank you.
Thank you. Anyone in opposition
of the bill? Anyone online, if
you could raise your hand,
opposition for House Bill 348.
OK, we'll go back to the chair.
Any comments before we open it
up to committee. uh, yes, madam,
check quickly.
Madam Chair, thank you. Um,
With respect to Mr. Hutchinson's
comment about uh imposing
penalties prior to a hearing
being or assessing penalties
prior to a hearing being
completed. What we did is we
tracked what uh is the process
for, for the Clean Water Act and
the, and the Clean Air Act and,
and related statutes where uh
potential violators are given a
written notice of violation, and
then they can, they can correct
the problem right there and they
wouldn't.
You know, the penalty wouldn't,
uh, wouldn't start assessing
until after they, they get that
written notice. The, the benefit
of this approach is that there
is an incentive on the part of
the person who received the
notice of violation to
self-correct the problem before
a lengthy litigation hearing
process is over. No penalty the
state engineer can't collect
any, any penalties though until
after those hearings. The state
engineer is going to have to
prove in a hearing that the
violation occurred and that the
penalty is the appropriate.
a penalty. So, so the notice put
somebody on notice that they
could be, could be subject to a
penalty, but it does not, um,
Actually create the liability.
You, you, you, you, uh, don't.
Have to pay a penalty until the
after a hearing. Um, I will, uh,
just briefly, um,
Respond then to uh Mr. Bollocks,
uh,
comments regarding uh certified
mail. So the current statute
requires our compliance orders
to be sent by certified mail.
Um, we have found that these uh
this is impossible for some
parts of New Mexico, for some
rural areas with certain letter
carriers certified mail is not
is not uh possible and so we're
in this position where there's a
statute that says, well, if
you're going to enforce against
somebody, you need to send them
this by certified mail. We can't
do
That, that creates a a a real
snag. The state engineer's
office will have the burden of
showing that the person got the
notice. So we have every
incentive at the agency to get
it to people by certified mail
if they, if we can or by other
effective means, a process
server would be the most logical
other means. Um, this gives us
the flexibility to, um,
effectually service on, on
anybody who, who might need it
for compliance order where right
Now, we cannot do that. Um, and
then lastly, uh, with respect to
Mr. Patterson's concerns. We
appreciate him, uh, coming to us
and, and, and talking about uh
these concerns are the, the, the
remaining concern he's mentioned
is the inflation adjustment, um,
We again tracked, uh, the
cleaner Act, Clean Water Act,
uh, statutes, so that these
penalties can keep pace with
inflation, and we don't have to
come back here. And once again,
say, well, our penalties didn't,
you know, didn't track inflation
and so we need another increase
because uh our penalties are
insufficient to, to deter
people. So that's the, that's
the reason for the inflation
adjustment in this bill. Thank
you,
Madam Chair,
Madam Chair, I move that we
adopt the amendment.
Any opposition?
So you have an amended bill, um,
we're gonna go now to committee
on the on the list we have
Representative Herrera.
Madam Chair, uh, thank you
presenters, um, can you
Can you go over with me how this
whole hearing process works, you
know, from the time that you
like, give them notice and then,
you know, what's the length and
how does,
uh,
If we get a uh
Or or we learn that somebody may
have committed some, some
violation. What the process
would be is, uh, we would send
them a letter, uh.
And that would be a not putting
them on notice that there's a
potential violation.
And then they might come back
and say you got it wrong, you're
looking at the wrong meter,
you're, you know, not, uh, you
know, looking at my neighbor or
whatever, um, that happens and
then everything goes away,
assuming it doesn't completely
go away there, um, if they
haven't remedied the problem
right then, what the next step
would be, would be we would
initiate an a hearing through a
compliance order.
And those are the fastest
hearings we have because we
don't want these things to be in
limbo for too long. So we try to
get those done in a matter of
just a small number of months
that we've kind of elevate this
to the top of our, of our docket
for our hearings unit, and so
say, you know, 4 months from
when the compliance order goes
to the person when we try to get
the hearing done.
People have an opportunity to,
to uh present whatever evidence
they wanted at the hearing. If
people are dissatisfied with the
hearing, they can take a de novo
appeal to district courts. So if
they think they didn't get a
fair shake from the state
engineer. They think the
district court in their district
would give them a fairer shake.
They can then take the matter to
that district, uh, to that
district court. And it's only
after that appeal's final, that
there'd be any sort of penalty
that they'd be liable for.
Um, Madam Chair, thank you for
that answer, and um
So, could you tell me
When, uh, so you go out you say
there's so when again, and I
know you said this, I just want
to hear it one more time. So
when does the fine start?
And, and if they rectify the
situation between the notice and
the hearing.
Madam Chair, uh, is once they
get in the written notice of the
violation.
Then the penalty can start
running from that period. If
somebody corrects the problem
right then, they've cut off the
penalty.
Um, that's the, that's the point
of getting that penalty to start
from there is to give people the
incentive to say, oh, well,
I didn't realize Maheki, you
know, wasn't working out, that's
just an over divergence, so
we'll be seeking penalties for
that in the first place. But if
somebody thought their permit
allowed them to sell water.
And we send them a notice of
violation saying, no, your
permit doesn't allow you to sell
water. Um,
They stop right there, the
penalty is.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you for the uh answer and uh
thank you for bringing this bill
for.
Uh thank you, Representative,
um, now have a representative
Zamora.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
the presenters for bringing this
bill forward.
Uh
I think I'll start with
With
Asking a question and, and
We talked about
In your presentation you talked
about cannabis and
On gas
And I'm wondering,
The biggest complaints I've
heard about is the windmill
farm.
They're going, they're going to
these little townships and
they're looking for water and
they're pumping water.
From municipalities.
Uh, storage tanks.
To mix their concrete because
they don't have any, any water.
There by the windmill, uh, where
they're putting in these
windmill farms.
So how
How would that affect the
situation.
Are they allowed
Take water from a township.
city
Is that water OK to be used in
construction?
Madam Chair.
Madam Chair Representative, it
depends on the, on the, on the
town, but typically, uh,
municipal water suppliers can if
they choose, make their water
available for construction
projects.
Uh, but that has to be the, you
know, the permission of the, of
that town.
And Madam Chair and
Can you tell me your first name,
your last name is hard to
pronounce. Madam Chair
Representative Nat is the first
name, Madam Chair, would you
mind if we call you? OK,
thank you for that, Matt. So
does it matter?
If they're transferring water.
Over county lines or anything
like that, if they, like if they
pull it out of bond and they use
it at the windmill farm in
Corona.
And how would that affect it?
Uh
Representative, if it's uh
validly sold for construction
project, we typically have this
either for wind farms or for
highways or something. Those,
those if if they're, if it's
validly sold to the construction
company, they can move it um
outside of the service area of
the municipality. OK, so, so
Madam Chen and that it won't.
It won't uh affect.
It won't slow down.
Projects in the state then if,
if that's so, uh,
OK, say we, we find a cannabis
farm.
an industry, uh,
Using
And uh
Breaking the law on the, if this
bill passes and and we they
would create this law.
And we find a cannabis farm
using this water illegal, not
only.
I understand the part about you
sending him a letter and, and
finding them and going through
the process and all that.
Will that water get shut off?
And, and will they be stopped
from using that water illegally,
Madam Chair, Madam Chair, yes.
OK.
What if, what if a farmer is
caught.
Using that well illegally.
And he needs to water his
livestock.
What, what'll happen then?
Madam Chair, if a farmer has an
emergency situation for his
livestock, the, uh, the, the
water could allows for
Senate conservation, that's the
one other place that I had a
hearing, but um there was one
senator who expressed concern
about the uh the CPI adjustment
there as well, the Senator
Cervantes, so we'll be going to
Senate Judiciary as well.
And, and I don't think that's
enough to kill the bill here in
this committee today, but.
Would you all take a look at
that and consider that.
Uh, making it
Making it just
A solid number instead of
something that's gonna be
changing on us. And then
And then, what if inflation goes
down? Are you gonna lower the,
are you gonna lower the
cost of the fine, Madam Chair,
yes, we'll follow whatever the
CPI, uh,
So I think the intentions are.
To make it go up is what your
intentions are, but
But you might wind up
Bringing it down. And to me,
that doesn't make a whole lot of
sense, uh.
May I, Madam Chair, may I answer
that quickly? I, I, I do think
that it's.
that it goes back down to $100 a
day. Madam Chair, and that
brings me to.
So, in the lineup thought that I
was thinking is we're already
raising it from $100 to $2000.
And, and we hear some testimony
that
That that's not enough.
To me, it sounds like a lot.
Uh
But we're already raising it
that much, so.
Why do we have to put this CPI
in there. I I just
And, and that's not.
That's not that big of a
difference if we could have a
solid.
Solid set price, uh, I would
feel better about it.
Uh
On, on, on page 3 section E line
7.
You're talking about a
compliance order may require
repayment of water.
That is diverted or illegally
diverted.
Can, can you kind of explain?
What a repayment of water would
be. Are we talking gallons of
water, or are we gonna put a
price on that water?
But I'm sure.
Madam Chair Representative, um,
Repayment of water is, is
When somebody over diverts, uh,
we in that gets caught. We ident
they have a water right. They
have some, some right to use the
correct quantity of water they
just pumped too much. Um,
This particular section, it's
not if they're selling the
water, it's just they, they
accidentally pump too much.
What, um, our current practice
is, is we look at their next
accounting year and we say,
well, if this was an intentional
over diversion.
Um, we want double repayment. So
let's say you had a 100 acre
foot water, right, and you
overpumped by 20 acre feet. Next
year, we want you to under
divert by 20 acre feet. Um,
that's what's meant by the
Like, how is, or is it or is it
diverting it out of the ground
also, is that, that, that
terminology. Oh.
Madam Chair Representative, when
we say diversion, we mean um
pumping water out of a well for,
for beneficial use or, you know,
taking surface water through a
gate for beneficial use.
Perfect. Thank you. Thank you
very much.
In a peer.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you for
The legislation. I'm
Still a little bit confused.
I'm sure, uh.
Probably a question for the LSC.
How many illegal wells have you
identified in the last 5 years.
Uh, Madam Chair, uh,
Representative, I
What we find are about 40 to 50
violations per year. Uh, I am
sure there are more.
Madam Chair and, and is it Matt
or Matt?
It's like an annoying bug,
Nah, not a joke.
Madam Chair, I'm definitely in
one ear and can't hear out of
the other, so, um.
So 40 to 50 violations, so
you're finding.
The OSC is, is locating.
40 to 50 illegal wells per year.
Because that was the original
question, Madam Chair.
It
Madam Chair, uh, Representative,
that 40 to 50 number, it, it
includes illegal wells, it, it
can also include other other
other violations. It's not just
4050 illegal laws. Oh,
correct my answer there.
So, Madam Chair and Matt, so,
um,
How many illegal wells have we
found in the last 5 years?
Madam Chair, I will, uh, try to
get you that information. We
don't have the, the number
broken down like that.
Madam Chair and and uh for the
office of the OSC.
What happens when you find
Somebody that is thrilled and
well without a permit.
Uh, Madam Chair Representative,
uh, what we do is we notify the
user right away that that's an
illegal well, uh, that it cannot
be diverted from effectively red
tagging the well, and we began
a, uh, you know, compliance
order process, but that won't
include
A monetary penalty that will be
meaningful right.
So Madam Chair and for the OSC
again.
You have no way to shut that
well down.
Uh, Madam Chair, uh, no, we.
We can, we order, uh, uh, uh
A halt to the use of the well,
we can follow that up through
through a core injunction if
necessary, so we can shut the
well down. We just can't get any
sort of
And I'm sure and for the office
of the OSC again, how many wells
have you shut down in the last 5
years.
Uh-huh
Madam Chair Representative, I
don't have that number at the
tip of my fingers. We will, we
will follow up with that.
Let him chair and presenters,
um.
The
The statement at the beginning
of the entrance to the bill.
Comments, uh, talks about
cannabis and oil and gas.
I'm sure in presenters I would
assume that there are some other
violators as well. Can you talk
to me about some of those
situations.
Uh
Madam Chair, Representative, um,
we have had some, some folks
just go out and drill illegal
wells for um
Multiple household livestock
use, uh, just people drill a
well without a, without a
license. Um, we have had
Um
Situations a number of, of over
diversion situations, um, those
are, those are, uh, enforcement
matters, and then we've had
situations where folks start
using water outside the police
abuse that they're allowed to
use the water. Um, so they have
a a well that has a permit, but
they're, they're outside their
permit.
Pardon me, madam chair, um, so.
I'm gonna ask the question more
specific this time.
Besides cannabis and oil and
gas.
What other violators have we
found?
Beside and you you did bring a
bag.
So, OK, so now we have 3. What
other violators do we have?
Um
Madam Chair, uh, representative,
I would say, uh, so commercial
sales for construction would be
another uh area and um sort of
multiple household, livestock
and domestic is in the other
area where we've seen illegal
wellies.
Madam Chair and presenters, so
would that include, um,
Our industries with respect to
wind and solar.
Uh, Madam Chair, uh, Mr.
Representative, the commercial
sales encompasses the, the
construction for wind and solar.
Interesting.
Madam chair and presenters, do
you have any issues right now
with respect to the sacus.
Madam Chair, uh, Representative,
there are
Going to be diversion over
diversion issues with the CA, we
have over 600 Eikis uh in the
state, um, and
There's, there's issues
regarding sometimes head gates
left open that that happens uh.
But that does happen.
Madam Chair and presenters with
respect to the bill and the
conversation inside the bill
with economic development or
benefit. Will you explain to me
again exactly how that part of
So Madam Chair Representative,
when if, if there's that only
applies to the sales, commercial
sales of water.
And so somebody is selling water
illegally. They don't have a
permit to do so. What that would
um do is it would say with the
amendment either.
Uh, the penalty, the maximum
penalty is double the economic
benefit, which um that
Concept is come over from, from
Clean Water Act and it would be
double the, the, the
Revenue from the, from the sale
of of the water or $25 per
barrel, uh, whichever is greater
would be the maximum penalty.
That's how that would work.
Madam Chair and presenters.
If we look at the economic
benefit with respect to
The push for
Moving towards carbon neutral,
carbon-free 2045.
And we look at economic benefit
in a multitude of different
ways, not just with what we
consider a revenue stream, but
we also look at the quality of
life. How do you identify that
when water is being used on a
wind farm.
Um, when we have over diversion
on wind farms when we have over
diversion on solar farms for
construction practices. How are
you putting, Madam Chair and
presenters, how are you putting
the economic benefit on the
quality of life that we're
assuming with 2045
Um, when we have over diversion
on wind farms when we have over
diversion on solar farms for
construction practices. How are
you putting, Madam Chair and
presenters, how are you putting
the economic benefit on the
quality of life that we're
assuming with 24
is about um uh
protecting our water?
Well, it is not an economic
development bill
and you're asking.
about quality of life and
economic benefit, not
developments.
Thank you for your clarification
representative representative,
um, if someone is stealing
water, they should pay for that
and they should be penalized.
That's what this bill is about,
period.
Madam Chair and presenters, I
understand that. So we look at
an economic benefit, we put a
benefit to
The changes that we're making.
We know that some of this.
Over diversion is happening.
On construction projects that
are subsidized by the state of
New Mexico, by the way.
How are we placing an economic
benefit to that.
Mr., let me just answer that,
Madam chair uh Representative
Pettigrew, if someone is
stealing water.
If they're buying or selling
water that they do not have a
permit for for really whatever
reason.
Then that's what this bill is
addressing and puts in.
And penalizes
Those folks for that reason.
If you're stealing water.
Buying illegally.
Uh, purchased water.
You're gonna be penalized if
it's for economic development.
And you're buying stolen water.
You will be penalized if you're
selling that water.
You will be penalized.
Not buying it. You're selling
that water.
Madam Chair and presenters, the,
the concept behind the spill is
a great concept.
I'm concerned that it doesn't
take certain things far enough.
And
Madam Chair and presenters, you
know, we talk about we can't get
certified mailed to certain
places in the, in the state. I,
I find that interesting, um.
So
When you notify
I
Rural area, somebody that you
can't find. Are y'all, does the
OSC use the sheriff's department
to
give that notification.
Uh, Madam Chair Representative,
yes, that's a, that's a frequent
way we provide notice or we
hire.
process server.
Thank you very much.
Um, many dozens, um, but what we
do know is that the Clean Water
Act.
At
At water, the water quality Act
is $15,000. OK, uh thank you,
Madam Chair, and thank you
presenters. I, I guess I was,
uh, I would give more to my
point, is the penalties that you
have in place here is so many
times we have to come back to
legislation and fix the
penalties. They could be sitting
on the books for 20 years and we
have not touched the penalties.
This is one of the items that
you are addressing in this bill
correctly. So we wanted to
with
our CPI so that it does not have
to constantly be coming back to
the legislature. Is that a
correct script.
Thank you Madam Chair
Representative. Sorry, I got a
last minute um questionnaire who
came in.
Before me so representative
Cade.
Madam
I apologize it didn't have it
written down, uh, go ahead,
Representative Matthews, but we
do have a due pass on the table.
I did have a couple of
questions.
Um
My first question, how do you
become aware?
Madam Chair Representative, we
do have um staff called Water
Masters, who are in the field
in, in, in the various districts
and they are charged with
ensuring that folks don't use
water, uh, illegally. So, so
they're out there patrolling,
um, oftentimes we'll get reports
from members of the public. They
see a lot of water trucks
driving by and they're
wondering, uh, where that water
is coming from, or they might
see uh
new, you know, fast lines, uh,
running places where they didn't
see it before, and they'll
notify our office and we'll go
out and investigate.
Thank you. Um, Madam Chair.
Um
Do you
These are civil penalties, I'm
wondering though.
You said that you do, you can
go, but I'm wondering if you
have somebody did.
Are there any kind of
Madam Chair, Representative, uh,
the water code again from 2007,
it does have some, some
misdemeanor provisions in there,
some criminal misdemeanor
provisions. We know bring those
types of criminal prosecutions,
criminal prosecutions are
extremely resource intensive.
They don't tend to, uh, uh, put
us in, in the great relationship
with folks in uh in in in the
area, the US law enforcement
officers and may not be able to
share information freely.
So, um, that's, that was
something that Senator Townsend
uh suggested was, was felony
provisions. That's not, uh, in
our judgment, the best way to
get uh to get compliance in into
um Madam Chair, thank you for
that answer. Do you?
You find that once you take the
action that
You don't have
I, I mean, how effective, Madam
Chair, sorry, how effective are
the fines right now are not
affected. That's why we're here.
But, um, the injunctive relief
that we obtain generally, it
sticks. Once people are, are
faced with an injunction, they
could
You know, face contempt
sanctions if they, if they
violate the injunctions. So we
usually get good compliance once
we get to an injunction but then
people are just rolling the dice
over whether they're going to
get caught and we're going to be
able to follow through and get
an injunction against them. So
they still have some incentive
to try to violate the law in the
first place in the absence of
these kinds of penalties
Um
Madam Chair Representative, so
the fine um would only the
The fine, it's not always going
to be the maximum fine.
Um, what the, uh, they'll
provides is that in in
determining the amount of the
fine, there are
A number of factors to be taken
into consideration and the
ability of the uh of, of the
viol to pay the fine is
certainly a relevant factor.
That is in every single
environmental statute. So if
somebody has a, has an issue
with not being able to pay the
fine. Um, they can certainly
raise that and that would be a
relevant factor in, in that
person's hearing. If even after
that, you have a fine where uh
somebody can't pay it, that
would be the same as any other
monetary judgment that somebody
would have against them but they
can't um.
They can't pay.
Uh
Madam chair, it so our.
So if you impose a fine, does
it.
Become a judgment against them
and a lien on their property.
Uh, Madam Chair, we have
I've never seen one of these
finds become a loan against
somebody, but yes, it would be
it would be a monetary judgment.
Um, um.
Could the water
for example.
Be subject to fines if it was.
Madam Chair, yes.
Um
Madam Chair, does that happen?
Madam Chair, there are some
municipal systems. It doesn't
have tend to happen with the
larger ones, but there are some
small municipal systems where
they do get over diversions,
they, they pump more than their
permits allow.
And Madam Chair, and that
circumstance they could, they
could be fined.
Uh, Madam Chair, the language
that, that we put in here saying
that if it's just an over
diversion, we're not going to
get a fine, uh, is meant to
protect in those situations. So
if they've just over diverted,
no, they could not get a fight.
Is there, do you find that any
violations are Madam Chair, yes.
That is one of the
Things that we see.
Mm
Madam Chair, just so I'm clear
that in order to permit of some
kind. yes. OK.
And
Um
If
I'm, I'm a customer of the
Albuquerque Water.
You and you and him.
I've been known to
water on, no, I don't think so.
They're, they permit, their
water right governs the total
quantity of water they can.
They can pump in a year.
Uh, from what Wells, uh, when
the Albuquerque Berno Lake
County Water Utility Authority
sets rules for their uh
customers about when they're
supposed to be watering, when
they're not, that doesn't affect
the water right that UNM has.
And Madam Chair, if
I
Uh, Madam Chair, Representative,
no, we can't. We, we regulate
the water rights holder, that's
between you and the authority.
Uh, I, I was hopeful that was
your answer because I certainly
it might be fined $2000.
Uh, thank you, thank you.
There's a motion on the
Referrea second it and it's
called the law.

based chair Keats. Yes, madam
chair Ortiz.
Thank you.
We have an 8 to 1 due pass vote
and Representative Pettigrew to
explain his
Mm
Madam chair presenters.
I really appreciate the bill.
I don't think it does some of
the things that it needs to do.
I'd love to have conversations
between the next committee.
And talk about how this ties
into some of the other acts that
we have.
other fines, fees, and penalties
that we have.
And how we can strengthen.
this piece of
Thank you and thank you very
much for your presentation, um,
just as a reminder, house Bill
362 is rolled, so we're now
gonna listen to House Bill 356,
356.
Representative Brown, as soon as
you're ready, we're ready.
Yes, um, Madam Chair, members of
the committee, this is House
Bill 356.
It's a 2-page bill.
which deals with replacement.
Uh, so, um.
This bill, Madam Chair members
would provide that replacement
wells within 100 ft of the
original well are not subject to
protest.
However, there would be as a
possible recourse for the
replacement well.
Um, I'd like to just take you
through, um,
A few little changes, some of
the changes are actually just.
Changing the word.
Uh, some of this is just clean
up length.
Uh, so some of those change, um,
the one that is, is on pages of
section B that says that within
100 ft of the original.
If the applicant is aggrieved so
what's happened here, Madam
Chair, a little municipality of
jail has for some time now
needed. Unfortunately, uh for
the protests.
And names
To this
And what this does, I'd like to
do is say you can't protest,
it's
It's just 100 ft away max.
Um
Be against it can file an
agreeable.
And a grievance and that that
would be then heard. So I have
some experts uh give you
additional information.
Um, he is the city we have next
Paul Drakos, who is a
hydrologist.
And then I think you met DL
Sanders, uh, in the previous he
is an expert water law. So let's
start with, I guess, Mr.
Sandy's.
I would say, um, as you know, Jo
is a small community,
I introduced you, but can you
introduce yourself
for the city of, um, another
small municipalities.
Um, and so we're very interested
in groundwater.
Um, Jo, you know, again this has
a very small aquifer.
That it draws its water from
it's probably the, that's
probably the most and the most
portable water supply.
Um, and we're very interested in
protecting that.
Um, and so first I just was
like I wanna tell you how much I
think y'all could appreciate
your efforts on the last bill.
That's an important bill because
we're aware of over diversions,
and that's how that gets to the
state engineer, you mentioned,
we think we're looking at
records actually and find that
they're over.
This particular bill doesn't
have anything to do with that. I
just wanna tell you how much I,
having been to the state
engineer for like 2 decades over
2 decades.
This is something that was
needed and it's been very hard
to have gotten that through, and
I, and I appreciate your CPI
comments, but um.
Getting these bills through
unless there's a drop or
something serious going on, you
could never get the fines to
catch up to what.
Uh, the cost benefit is of
taking that, taking that water
illegally and depriving others
of it is what you're doing.
Um, no, I'm just commenting and
appreciating you for that at
last piece from behalf of all my
clients in this particular bill,
um.
There are virtually been no
protests that occur as a result
of this bill.
Replacements have already gone
are, are, are an adjunct to the
existing water right. It's
already gone through the public
welfare and conservation issues,
um, it's already gone through
water availability. The only
issue then would be impairment.
Our hydrologist will tell you,
and I think you'd be hard
pressed even for a state
engineer, um.
Hydrologist to find any instance
where you drill a well with 100
ft of the original of the
original well.
In which you will change the
hydrology such that somebody
will then become impaired.
And I think that's why it's
written the way it is. It's a
tentative allow folks to get a
fast track.
Uh, process, um, and most, most
people will not protest that
because they just don't get.
Um, granted, I mean, the
protestant will lose, but it's
one way to tie up things.
And in certain instances we're
on it's unclear probably to some
of you and maybe to me that why
there why people follow these
protests, and it does bog things
down. State engineer, I mean,
excuse me.
The City of Jo, they are very
difficult they're very
challenged to continue to get
water supply.
Um, I know you guys are probably
very familiar with the fact that
every small community in the
state is always, you know,
struggling to get money and then
even if they get money to get
those facilities they need
constructed because Angela has
been very progressive in that
ability.
congratulations to them for our
heart.
So this bill does more deprive
anybody of any kind of um
Of uh
Uh, kind of a kind of a right to
to protect the right. I mean,
the rights in under the law in
New Mexico or under the Supreme
Court decisions and the
Constitution, you guys decide
who gets what's right, uh, like
domestic wells, no protest, you
can build domestic walls.
here
You can, since it's a very it's
very limited and it's only
vindictive in my opinion when
people file protests here.
Um, and in this particular case,
that's what's happened. So I
don't wanna over over over talk
it, but it's a good bill, I
think something is needed and
even though the engineer says we
won't, it won't.
Cost him more resources, it
should actually reduce any
resources hearing could take
several days, and they have to
commit resources that could be
used on enforcement. That's why
I bring it up. I'm just kind of
like in terms of where they
could better use their limited
resources, and one would be
enforcement over having to.
Proceed on a hearing, uh, which
can be very costly.
You know, hourly rates with with
experts and lawyers are
are on contract and they're
significant. I, I mean, I don't
want to get myself out of work,
but
Um, I do, I, I felt, you know,
folks down there have to pay for
this, and it's not fair to with
that, if you have any questions,
I'm happy to ask more, um,
perhaps with the hydrology, you
might want to have pulse just
kind of chime in, so you have a
degree of comfort with the, the
nature of it. I've worked with
him.
Or his company for off and on,
like all hydros for 30 years.
Yeah, I like, um, and he's the
hydrologist.
And give us some more, um,
background. uh, good morning,
Madam Chair, committee members.
My name is Paul Drakos with
Glorieta Jude and I'm the
hydrologist for the city of
Zhao.
And um I'll just speak briefly
about this, but, uh, this, this
bill pertains to uh uh.
Disallowing protests for a
replacement well drilled within
100 ft.
that does not increase the water
rate.
There's no additional water
being pumped.
And hydrologically.
it's it's essentially the same
well.
Um, particularly in the case of
al basin aquifer, and in the
particular case that we're
dealing with.
It's really there are is a.
It's essentially a nuisance
protest that's being filed to
gain leverage for a case in a in
a different underground basin.
In a different aquifer.
So, uh, that is what.
The city is dealing with, uh,
and essentially it's just to
create additional costs for the
city. These uh municipal wells
have to be designed and
constructed to uh much different
standards than uh domestic and
irrigation wells. These wells
cost the city a million dollars.
And
I'm, I'm involved with the whole
process from designing the well,
uh, to working on the drilling
rig with the driller and
analyzing the cuttings that come
out and designing the well and
testing it. So I'm very
intimately familiar with it.
It's painful to see that the
city be slowed down and being
able um to effectively put it to
use and to really
uh continue to uh affect their
water.
s
And then finally I'd like us to
hear from Mr. Hooper.
Manager of jail.
Um
As Paul said, it takes a million
dollars to to get a well drilled
and online, um, and then you run
into protests and it takes 10s
of hundreds of thousands of
protests in order to use that
well.
Um, and when you're in emergency
situation, uh, in order to
provide the services needed to
your community, um, it creates a
huge hardship.
Um, luckily with the city of
Jal, um, we do have
Some revenues that we can cover
these types of things, but there
are communities out.
may not be able to cover.
Um
The protests, um.
And the time needed.
Thank you. Is there anyone in
the audience that um
Uh, is in support of the bill.
You can come up and you can
speak and you have somebody
with.
You, you'll have.
2 minutes.
I won't take 2 minutes, Madam
Chair, members of the committee,
Howard Hutchinson with the
coalition, the Baron, the Mexico
counties.
And we are in in support of the
the legislation, uh, we see
numerous frivolous suits that
are that are brought um
sometimes uh just as a personal
disagreement.
And I think this bill addresses
that point.
There is one slight concern.
And that is the depth of the
replacement well.
Uh
When we're mining an aquifer.
Oftentimes increasing the depth
of of well can affect.
An adjacent water right holder,
so but
The bill does have a provision
in it, uh, so if a person isn't
bringing a frivolous action, uh,
that, that it does allow for
that protest to to go forward,
and I, I think
But
When we talk about this, we need
to talk about depth of well too.
Like.
Thank you. Anyone else who's in
Madam Chair, Aaron Bollock with
the Pecos Valley Artesian
Conservancy District and Howard
stole all of my thunder, so uh
same concern, the depth of the
well is important, but support
the concept. Thank you.
Thank you. Uh, any support
online?
Madam Chair, we do have
I'm so sorry we have another one
here, of course.
Madam Chair, uh, Representatives
Natakkers for the Office of the
State of Engineer, uh, in our
analysis, we became neutral. We
generally are very hesitant to
Take away anybody's right to to
do protests. Um, I don't think
it's, it's wrong with al saying
that the protests that that
we're seeing in their neck of
the woods are, are fairly
described as nuisance protests
to um gum up the works of of
neighbors and that's obviously
not uh what the protest process
is for. At the same time, Mr.
Hutchinson and Mr. Bali have,
have um highlighted an important
issue, um, we are concerned, it,
I believe it's the
bottom of page one, top of page
2, there's some existing
language struck out called and
only the same and it's
effectively would would deal
with the problem that these
gentlemen are talking about
that, that, um,
A replacement well should be
going to the same aquifer as the
uh previous well. And we, uh, we
raised that as a technical issue
in our analysis, um, again, we
don't, we don't oppose this
bill, um, we're loath to take
anybody's right to protest away,
but, um, that's, that's one
change that we would like to see
with this bill is that and only
the same language stay in the
bill. Thank you. I stay in law.
Thank you, uh, Madam Chair.
Thank you. Anyone else uh in
support, OK, anyone in support
on Zoom?
Yes, we do have one speaker,
please state your name when
you're unmuted.
I, uh, I would like to thank our
team that is there and support.
We have for the past 7 years,
been very proactive and trying
to protect our soul water
source, and it, this isn't the
first case that we've seen.
For we've been protested, uh,
Uh, by a protestant doesn't have
any water rights or would be
affected by what we're trying to
do.
Uh, I, I have no
Heartburn on the additional
language that that that uh
indicated. I've learned over the
past 7 years, there are
hydrologists where the red bed
is and how deep our wells are,
we are the only ones gaining new
data out in that well field. Uh,
excuse me, uh, Madam Chairman, I
didn't greet you properly,
members. Uh, thanks for the time
today.
May I please have you state your
name for the record one more
time. I'm Stephen Aldridge,
mayor of Jo.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Is there
Anymore on online for, for
support. Is there anyone in the
audience who's in opposition?
None in opposition is there any
one on opposition online.
All right, we'll stand for
committee questions. First up is
Representative Pereira.
Madam Chair, when uh
Representative Brown brings a
bill before this body, I listen.
Uh, we've partnered a lot on uh
I really
you know, small cities have the
same rules that big cities have,
that's been.
Representative Moya.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um,
thank you so much. I'm trying
to, again, learn all of this
stuff, so if you can walk me
through, um,
When someone is gonna uh drill a
well, anyone can come and
protest that, and then now that
stops that drilling and you have
to address that first. Um, how
does that work?
Madam Chair Representative,
that's a good question, and I
should have been clear about
that. Um, this is there, you're,
that's correct if you're getting
a new appropriation or you're
moving a water right around the
stake. This particular instance
we're just talking about.
A well that's already here,
we're moving with 100 ft.
So this only applies to this
very limited instance where.
You know, it's not going to
change the hydrology in any
significant way that would cause
the existing situation to
change.
Um
And so I would, and I would
point out that Mr. Hutchinson is
his concern and uh Mr. uh
Laylatern, our are fair.
Um, I think that the state
engineers recommendation to
restoring this language.
A lot of language in here like
the Attorney general, you know,
they said like um uh.
A rival is not a word. Well,
it's a term of art with our
practice of law and and water
rights, you know, you have a
grieved a grievval and so these
are things that you very should
be changed. I've seen it
happens. I've left state
engineer a couple of times.
But this language should be
restored because it does have
significant digital type
language that people rely on and
know what it means, so I
appreciate their editing because
they're probably right, but
unfortunately when this bill was
enacted, the body of law that
continues with that. So I'm
sorry.
Go on for your question, but the
question is very limited.
Madam Chair,
And it's moving it from within
that 100 ft and usually because
that well is the casing's been
separated or something has
happened to that well that we
cannot use it anymore, and so
it's replacing that well.
Thank you Madam Chair, and, and
so, so basically, um, like right
now, without this particular
law, anyone that is going to
drill one, anyone can protest.
It's.
The conservation and
Public Welfare
Um, these wells have already
gone through that. The existing
wells already gone through that
process. So that being deprived
of that opportunity. This is
just already said it's, it's uh
it's.
Thank you. Um, and then Madam
Chair, um, the, this, um, when
you're, when you're going, when
you're
Um
Beginning the process, you have
to go through like a request for
proposal, right? So you have to,
you know, put it out to bid and
everything else, and those bids
usually have a timeline,
correct?
Madam, yes ma'am. So, uh, Madam
Chair, and, and, um, and serves
so this is, so every time
there's a protest, often you
will have to then go back out
for request for proposal will go
out for bid and do those bids
sometimes come back higher
because now time has passed.
yes men.
So, so thank you, Madam Chair.
So, and, and I think that's
really important, especially if
you're just replacing it and
it's not taking any other water
any more water, any, you know,
that kind of stuff, because all
you're doing um in this case is
costing a city, a lot of money.
I mean, luckily Gel has that,
but
There's so many
Towns that don't.
So they and they don't have the
tax base in order to possibly
have to pay more because who
knows what a well is gonna cost
next year if this is going to
take another year with another
protest. So I'm in support of
this bill. Thank you.
Representative Matthews.
Thank you
Thank you Madam Chair and thank
you.
So I'm, I'm looking at the bill
and I just had a question about
how it works. In subsection
lines 20 to 25.
You take a win
And then, Madam Chair, in.
Just above that, you had a new.
Paragraph.
Finds 15 to 19.
Apparently
Uh, as I read it.
It appears that
Somebody is agreed by the state
engineer action on the
application.
They can protest it with the
state engineer.
That's right.
I think it's just vernacular,
yeah, if, if, if the job were to
be denied, it's permit.
Uh, to replace the well.
And we think it's wrong, we can
ask for a hearing before the
state engineer.
And if that hearing is we're
still denied, we can go to
district court. Thank you just a
reminder to the presenters, you
go to the chair. Thank you.
A long time.
Madam Chair.
So Madam Chair,
But the it it
Couldn't the applicant.
Be the protester.
person who's making.
Because the applicant.
They they've been protesting
their own application. what
you're saying is a protesting
the state engineer's decision.
That's called like what they
call it a rival, that's what the
statute. If you're a grieved by
the decision.
It's not easy stuff.
And I'm sure I'm just trying to
understand.
The applicant is always going to
be the city of job.
And it wouldn't be a
Um
Madam Chair, I believe that
anybody can file for
replacement.
On their own. It applies to
anybody who's see, you've
already had your water right.
Your wealth was as uh West was
explaining the reasons for that.
You just need to get your water
just curious.
Applicant could be an irrigator.
That needs that needs a
replacement well within 100 ft.
And
If there and this would, they
would be they would not be a
protest allowed, but if they're
neighbor felt like
Well, I, I think that is gonna
affect me. They, they, they're
this allows for that
that they that they.
Man,
I might.
Gotta remember these walls,
these and you.
So I, I, I appreciate the
challenge I, I, you probably
find a lot of
I mean, it doesn't make, it's
not clear to the individual.
Representative Rubio.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative, um.
I've spent a lot of, I, I was
just thinking about how I used
to have some of my best games
there, basketball games there
and some of my worst basketball
games there. Um, I used, I, I'm
very, very familiar, but I just
had a question regarding the
protest.
How many
How, how often do they happen?
Any time with the city of Jal um
anytime that we're trying to
drill a new well or replace a
well.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative, um,
and so, um, do you have an, I
mean, how frequent are they?
Madam Chair, in the situation
that Giles in, um, we're, we're
kind of on the razor's edge as
far as being able to provide
enough water for our citizens,
um, and we've put in
Regulations as far as, you know,
when they can water their yard
and we've got, we've done all of
that.
Um, but we're trying to
Diversify our, our water sources
in order so that we get off of
that razor's edge and we're not
uh constantly worried that if
we're going to be able to
Thank you, Madam Chair
Representative, and I guess my
question because we, I guess my
question is, how does, how will
this still change in the
language impact.
The rest of the
Madam Chair and Representative
Rubio, I, I think what it's
gonna do is give
Endless protests is it it's
basically, um, I think the
intent of this statute.
To begin with was protest
feature.
is actually getting in the way
of that happening. So I think
really if this bill passes.
Madam Chair, um,
I
um,
A lot of them, in my opinion,
wouldn't be able to afford.
Um
To fight the protests, even
though.
These types of protests were
probably going to be approved,
um, but the amount of funding
that it takes to fight them, um,
And then the the amount of time.
Um, is very burdensome on.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative. And so.
And, and I, I recognize that
there's that that a lot of small
communities.
And I guess what happens if
there are legitimate issues with
not going to hand be hand be
available to them.
Uh, Madam Chair, representative,
that's a good question, um, and
you know, sometimes we put a, we
should put faith in the state
engineer.
They have a, a historically they
had an excellent hydrologist in
that agency.
Um, and they have had people who
do a really good job. I mean, I
know, and I see that, I'm a
reformed regulator of one way, a
lot of the rules that are out
there are things that
I might have done differently
today, but, uh, cause you don't
get that practice, right? Uh,
but the one thing they do great
consistently is hydrology.
And uh even though we might
disagree about them at times,
um, about their modeling.
We're not in that big of this,
we're within a range of
disagreement, uh, they're very
good, um, and they would be able
to tell you and like, it's just
like um you know council chuck
was just said.
He, um, the change in language
back to the, the language that's
in the, in the uh in this
current statute to be restored.
Um, and they make every effort
to ensure that that when you
re-drill a well, replace it
well, move a well, you are not
changing the source of water, I
think at Lake Arthur, that's
kind of one of those concerns.
It, uh, if I recall correctly,
correctly, you know that there's
a variable, uh, there's a
shallow and there's the deep and
you wanna make sure that you
move into the same aquifer and
not take water from somebody
else.
And I think the state engineer
could be relied upon for that.
And in fact, they tend to be
overly conservative.
That's why you need to be able
to read their decision because
they tend to be too
conservative, which is good for
everybody else. I'm just saying
it's.
Even, I mean, I, I recognize
that, like I have a lot of it as
well and um and so I'm just, I,
I just want to
That when it comes to when they
raise them.
Have a chair and represent
Rubio, so I, I think I
understand your question and
Context.
Very defined the current law
says that well, so if someone
thinks Herman, there's still,
again, but then the person who's
come in with a, a process. It's
called a grieval.
Madam, thank you.
Representative Pettigrew.
Thank you, Madam Chair. My
questions have been asked and
answered. I do support the bill.
And uh
hope to see it pass all the way
through.
Thank you, ranking member
Zamora.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you presenters for bringing this
bill forward. We, we heard
talk and, and, and
Discussion on, on the depth of
the well.
And then we heard uh
Online
Uh, via Zoom.
Testimony uh from a gentleman
about
That he wasn't so concerned
about it.
And
I feel like there shouldn't be
any concern because we're
staying in the same aquifer and
that you read that sentence just
a little, which tells me that
we're staying in the same.
Water
So
I don't understand the concerns
about the depth of the wealth.
Now
There was some talk about
concerns of the depth of the
world because
The neighbor might
Feel like you might be sucking
the lower water.
We have seen in the past.
Where a well was drilled.
Not all the way to Redbed.
And
That's what caused the issue and
you run out of water, so then.
So then for whatever reason,
maybe old casing plus that, you
need to drill a new well within
100 ft. You feel like the
water's there just.
Maybe the first one wasn't done
right.
Or, or
Maybe that's not the, the
language you are to use is it
didn't have to be drilled to
that depth.
at that time because of the
water levels static water levels
that existed.
So I myself don't have any
concerns about the depth of the
well.
I, I think that
That uh
That those concerns
are addressed in in the language
of the bill.
So
I'm in, I'm in full support of
the bill, Madam Chair, and, and
with that, I'd like to move a do
pass.
So there's a still another
speaker, but we'll put it on the
table from a ranking member some
more a do pass.
There's
Um
I also appreciate the intention
of the bill, but I still have
questions about as so for
context, Madam Chair and
sponsors I represent district,
and down in my part of New
Mexico, we are all irrigators. I
certainly raised my hand when I
realized we work out your water
source. I commend that. I
appreciate you all for being so
proactive in leading this
conversation. And for the
district I represent, it's
individual New Mexicans.
Who are dealing with wells that
aren't working or wells that run
dry, and certainly in my part of
New Mexico.
It is like the commonly held
conversations and understanding,
like so and so.
Just dropped their well 5,
however many feet and now mine's
dry, like that is.
The the talk at the post office,
right?
Um, so for me, representing a
district like that, and in
specifically, Madam Chair,
hearing the OSC I don't know why
I'm pointing out there. Oh, he's
back here still.
Hearing the OSC um.
Concerns about language. I just
want to flush that out a little
more clearly. um OSE in the FIR
does say on the back of page
two, there could be legitimate
disputes regarding whether a
deep and well is in the same
underground stream channel
artisan basin reservoir or lake
is the original well.
And if due to the age of the
world, documentation may not
exist to show which underground
water. Is there any way we can
provide clarity on that is my
first. I don't know how much I
want to talk about the modeling
that can be done.
And in this case has been to
show no impairment.
Uh, but let me turn that over to
Sanders.
representative.
Um, I think that the, the
suggestion for restoring.
The, the strikeout.
It starts on page one and line
25 and goes on to page 2, line
1.
The the same and only the same
underground stream.
I think that addresses that
concern, uh, with respect to
some of the comments of
representative Zamora, uh, in,
in the areas, uh,
Such as the gel basin where
there, there's a defined.
A of the aquifer and some old
wells weren't, you know, weren't
fully penetrating or replacing
that with a well that does go to
the bottom, the, the.
the
Any additional diversion beyond
the original water right would
not affect.
Uh, would not affect other
users.
Madam Chair, I'm madam sponsor.
Um, so if I understand you
correctly.
Are you
saying that even though your
bill as presented in front of us
currently strikes that language
that you'd be open to keeping
that language.
Madam chair, madam, sponsor, the
answer to that is yes.
Sanders weigh in as well.
I just, I just want to point
out, Madam Chair, committee
members that that
Breakout language is not at our
request.
OK, Madam Chair, um, for now,
I'd, I'd like to get back to
that just so I can clar um
willingness and interest, um.
If we may ask then to the, the
comments left with us by OSC and
Madam Chair, if it's appropriate
that we bring them forward if
needed in a minute, but, um,
madam sponsor, is there, in your
understanding of, of the way
they weighed in, is there other
amendments that you would see as
friendly amendments to help
tighten the bill, understanding
they were not here in support or
opposition, but offered some
clarification they found to be
helpful. Madam Chair and
Representative, I'm always.
Madam Chair, then I'd like to um
move a committee amendment.
to do that?
OK, then beginning on page one,
line 25.
I'd like to
I haven't done this in a long
time. Undo.
The strike through.
That begins on page 1 line 25,
starting with and
a representative. I'm, I'm
terribly sorry to interrupt.
But do we want to get
consultation from the office,
uh, Nat for language here. I can
understand why the drafter
didn't like that language, but
it also feel like I agree with
you, we do need something in
there. Is there a language in
which uh Nat is comfortable in
suggesting here.
I'm, I'm sorry to interrupt. I
just want to make sure that we
get it right. Thank you.
Madam Chair, may I?
I, I think what the amendment
proposed is just the.
On striking the language so that
there's no language change,
right?
Uh, representative
I, I, yeah, I'm very aware of
that. Um, I understand why the
draft, and I'm wondering whether
or not if the attorney that is
here can be able to provide us
with
Language that they believe that
will serve all of our goal,
which is to tighten and make
this a successful bill.
Thank you.
Brown
Madam Chair, uh, Representative
Samona, thank you. Um, the
concern that we've raised simply
removing the strike through of
the language that I think
representative Lara Karena was
going to propose, would, um,
that, that would that
Is what we were suggesting if we
were writing the statute to you
today, we'd read it differently,
um, but in terms of just uh uh
Having everybody being cleared,
be on the same page about, about
what's being changed and what's
being not removing that straight
through is, uh, is appropriate.
Thank you for clarifying. Please
continue representative
that wasn't uh that would be
addressed based on the comments
you provided earlier.
Um, Madam Chair Representative,
um, there's, we don't have any
other suggestions.
Thank you.
A long way to get the clarity we
were
with them. Thank you, Madam.
So.
I have one of the legends in my
spare time. I actually read it.
And my guess is it's because
it's colloquial.
No I might, uh, as I said, a lot
of these laws are.
are old and there's there are
any time the legislature makes a
change, Supreme Court said they
do that with all knowledge of
all laws, and they potentially
did something for a reason
other, and that's why I think
both Nat and I are one.
Getting keeping these things
consistent, it just opens up a
bag of wars that are hard and
challenging to.
Thank you, thank you. Go ahead.
Thank you, Madam to continue
then to clarify, we are going to
do an amendment starting on page
one.
Removing the strike through.
Beginning with the word and,
line 25, continuing to page 2,
line 1, only the same.
So all we're doing is lifting
that strike through.
That section, subsection one
should read the well is drilled
into the same.
And only the same underground
stream channel artisan, artesian
basin reservoir or lake as the
original.
Thank you. So, uh, please
forgive your new chair, your,
your inexperienced here, um, I
was incorrect in expecting um
ranking members more as motion
because he had just finished
speaking. But now I'm ready for
emotion as the committee
amendment.
Madam Chair, do we need to vote
on the amendment?
Madam.
I'm adopting the amendment.
Um,
You have an emotion.
A move would do past manager.
And it's Herrera's 2nd.
The role

Representative Herrera.
Representative Laura Kadena.
Yes, on HB3 Representative
Matthews.

Ranking members Amora.

leaves, do we need to?
Bill the first bill and then
adopt the second one? Oh, OK,
OK, OK, you, you're good. And,

amended bill.
Thank you, Madam Vice Chair
Keats.

Uh, 7 in favor, 1 opposed.

For those, we rolled our final
bill on the agenda and so we are
adjourned.
Oh
