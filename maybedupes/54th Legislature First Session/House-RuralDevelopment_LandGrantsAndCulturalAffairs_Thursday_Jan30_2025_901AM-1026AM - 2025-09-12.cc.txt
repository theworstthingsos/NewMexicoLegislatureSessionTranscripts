Good morning.
Represented here.
Represents Gonzalez.
Here, here.
ward?
Representative.
Bye.
Chairs.
OK,
we have today
so let's let's get started with
Garcia
and I believe you should have.
I like this.
Good morning, Madam Madam Chair
and members of the committee.
It's very, very much appreciate
the opportunity to give you your
presentation today.
Good good morning uh my name is
Garcia and I'm the executive
director of the Association
and
the chairman of the Commission.
Uh
Good morning everybody.
I'm glad to be here and this is
thank you.
Uh my name is
and I'm very happy you're here
with Paula to get together.
We make a lot of and a lot of
noise.
Thank thank you.
And I'm glad to see those.
Thank you for the opportunity to
present to you this morning
for Mexico are part of our
communities in terms of
agricultural heritage and
the water resources.
We have a um I'll I'll be going
over and I want to start with an
explanation of the.
How are you today?
I represent Association
executive director
and our president is here as
well.
He's right here.
He's afounder of the Association
in 1989 and
he's our president right now and
we have several members of our,
um, they could just their hands.
I want to introduce all of
them,
How are you today? I represent
Association executive director
and our president is here as
well.
He's right here.
He's afounder of the Association
in 1989 and
he's our president right now and
we have several members of our,
um, they could just their hands.
I want to introduce all of
them,
uh, several people that are part
of part of our team.
this morning
And
we also
association is a nonprofit
membership organization
that
provides techs does
is governor appointed
that advises the legislature.
work closely
in terms of our work and our
tech technical assistants and
the advocacy.
I'm, I'm
I just like that
was in 19987,
the Commission and the US Army
criteria used to determine
funding program.
The Commission was established
by
by by 1993 legislature
or desires
for communication between
organizations
and the state and federal
governments and plants
or legislation to the governor
and then the Mexico
and we were asked and I asked.
What does this mean to you
and then the thing is that.
So we have to be aware and I'll
talk about that later.
Thank you
Madam Madam Chairman is one of
our,
our very and she's
a statesman and movement and
with her today.
I mentioned earlier
and there are 700 across the
state in Mexico, um.
We don't don't know exactly how
many.
Um, and I want to tell you first
about the importance of in our
communities, especially in terms
of governance.
First of all, in manage
most of the non-Indians.
When you think in terms of what
they're
they're one of the most
important.
Yeah, and you do all this work
as local elected officials
elected communities
and
they do this and
and
and where is the commissioner
and
uh you know it is.
I know that is generations and
so it's great to be able to.
your perspective and experience
as well.
The other important thing is
that it
it
it that the farm farmlands and
they allocate the waters.
In addition
to that
education.
And also involved in
rehabilitating their
infrastructure.
In addition, a very important
role
in water rights.
They have the statute to prove
the transfers.
As I mentioned on the next
slides
there's there's that shows the.
The location
and you look at this map you'll
see the map.
Most of the overlap with with
the the the
the traditional community,
but they're not not just um
They're not, they're not.
There's there's some
grants,
but you can see where they're
located
and you can see that they're
most of them were in Mexican
County County.
So they're 2.
The next shows an image of the
rat
and I really like this image
because it shows the centrality
of water
to the establishment of grants
grants are established with
consideration, mindfulness of
the watershed
to the waters and also
considered communal and
from that point.
Um, not
not all
the,
there are some such as
places like that.
In the territory
In the period
remain even in the grants were
being um privatized and were
fragmented through
code created the predecessors.
Um,
the Constitution. So.
They did not, not in the New
Mexico.
As
districts
of the state in 199655.
The next slide shows you what
what look like in action.
And
this shows a crew of site.
This has happened every spring.
And
this has for many generations.
This is continue to exist
and this is the
and it it's uh it's essential to
equitable distribution.
And uh they maintain the
radiation works.
I'm gonna talk about issues that
are really pressing for
education.
Um,
are deeply involved in
a legal process
and water rights.
Uh, uh
so that they can have a common
so that they can have
education.
And in the 1980s,
and that that fund.
resources and experts in the
process.
Uh, the ACC is allocated through
a grant process through
the IISC and NDA committee
that
funding
and
that is vital to the defense
rights
it has been been
in in.
100,000s.
The next shows what
kind of looks like they're
seeing
in this case this case of the
lawsuit
was in 19966 and it was settled
in 2013. It was the longest
running lawsuit in the
history. So
that's the kind of work that had
to do
in addition to their role.
to become more
right
and that that work continues
we are always for the community
to have enough funds.
Uh, the next I want to share
with you about what.
And
as I mentioned earlier centuries
of ancient
100
differently as in the land,
making them more right.
And that's the challenge.
Uh,
for, for many years fi protests
and continue to do so
to transfer so
um that's the 80s and that
strategy continued for over 20
years in the early 20000s, um,
in 20003,
reforms in our history and that
was to
as local institutions
local government
to be able to approve or deny
application for water.
And that is important because it
gives our community.
It's a it's a community that has
a future
and for agriculture is a very,
very important part of our
future and, and we have to
institutions.
Yeah.
Our next shows, um,
which was one of one of the very
early part of.
And also there's there's a
slight 2003 legislation
and and in in
in the years since the passing
of that bill
has worked with over 500ating
bylaws. So the, the
language, the statue so that
they can connectively um.
implement that they have which
is very significant.
Um, the point is infrastructure
recovery.
And I wanna wanna 1st
1st explain a little bit
infrastructure is
and most important part is that
is the the the digit itself and
I say it in
in our language yes
not
not it's the community of
people.
So, but means of the people and
the, um, but, but
so.
So that
that's you'll hear that I'm
explaining is
is an important part of that
maintenance. But we also have,
um, what we call in
and they they managed with a lot
of local expertise to get it to
go.
members.
So
Infrastructure
Infrastructures exercise their
water rights and
and it's it's
equally managed.
I
guess that makes eligible for
funding.
And
Oh, that means that we're
eligible for.
But
in 2019
and instructure
and then 23, the established.
And that
is
And that
processing about $55 million in
infrastructure projects.
I tell you a little bit about
the disaster recovery
um being
um impacted by disasters,
especially since 2022, but it
started with with
the years ago, um,
and that's when we recovery
2022
and
And then between 2022 and 24
fire flooding has damaged 200
across the state.
So it's part of our policy has
been to ensure programs,
and then those
those programs are streamline
access programs.
Um, additionally we, we
providing tech tech assistance
to those.
Um
So one of the slides that
infrastructure,
you can see what looks like when
it's being
um repaired in this case it's
debris removal
and can
include uh of silt, um.
Uh,
what would it be and it has to
be moved over and over again
because it rains
the burned the Hill,
um, there's, there's another
picture here.
And you could see the
infrastructure
and there's also
um the slopes.
The lights,
um, it was there's there's more
than more than 90
and
a little bit outdated but more
than 70s
and has a program as well.
Uh, the next
next slide shows
and uh there's some numbers
there. There were about
20 seconds that that were
impacted their healing
and in 24 floods, uh,
the area of the Lincoln County
and the
we
we recently learned that that
cruise.
So this is something that's
happening.
and uh for us it's it's a major
challenge.
I have 3 issues with
with disaster requirement.
Um, every other
other disaster except the
25% requirement for the program.
That's FEMA and that's in USDA
programs and I simply don't
don't have the resources to that
municipalities and counties
don't have that.
It's hard to be able to
access these programs, um,
because,
um, has, has to be immediate and
the state did some work with
DDT.
contractors, but it's not
helping
in every disaster. It's not me
that's a technical assistance
we're we're providing some but
but
our capacity.
Um, the last flight that we have
here is a very quick sum summary
of
I know you're not um a budget
committee,
but to give you a
table showsed projects from
ICIP and then there's the 20%
requirement for
and then there's
The program,
um, expected um in this year, so
just telling us about million
dollars
we're we're we're confident in
saying that there are millions
of dollars each year.
Um,
with the disaster recovery,
the final slide about tech tech
we're providing
we have we have 6 teams
assistance on infrastructure
compliance management
work with contractors
and management consultant who
helps us with.
And we also judges
and
turning to Mary with your
questions. Thank you very much,
Paula.
I like to see we all appreciate
that and
and with
your
questions. Thank you very much,
Paula.
I like to see we all appreciate
that.
And I I'd like
to tell you just how important
to us. It's important for human
health, sanitation, agriculture
ecosystem and economic
development.
Its
wildlife
and have access to safe water.
And my life
without community serious health
risks,
and challenges
for survival and sustainable
development
and, and for us and we many
words because that, that's our
first stepped up in the persons
of the.
and uh I would I would like to
tell you that I was
the first time I had to do my
my
my dad to, yeah,
and I I have to do that every
day for uh for for for
weeks and I appreciate that the
water that was there.
And so we know that in our
system we have to all
work together and we all have
commissions and we all work for
the betterment of the community
and that that's what we look for
here is to have
commissions and we all work for
the betterment of the community
and that that's what we look for
here is to
the
humanity of Mexico because.
And so we know that in our
system we have to all
work together and we all have
commissions and we all work for
the betterment of the community
and that that's what we look for
here is to
the humanity of Mexico.
But there's there's any
questions.
I'm sure with that answer
because we've been there, uh, I,
I was very involved in the in
the
Watergate and it was very uh
knowledgeable
Senator Speaker of the House
was very helpful thank you.
Thank you so much so much for
that presentation. I really,
really appreciate all the
details. Um, I'm gonna go over
my mic.
Gonzalez.
Um,
Madam, not necessarily a
question but um just a
recognition. I just want to
think um.
Both organizations that Mexico,
um,
personally you're telling about
having that experience, my
family
and part of my history and
culture and as long as I can
remember. Um also disaster
recovery. I just really wanna
thank everyone.
all their efforts,
myself,
um.
I consider myself a little in
comparison
being the one issue we have is
that
that keeps coming to from the
runoff of those other areas, but
um
just for all your work and my
Mame.
Uh.
Thank you for presentation.
That has been devastating.
The fire.
New Mexico and then.
We're what happened in
California.
is the same thing
just a couple of questions
here.
Which.
You know, it's
we're we're not.
Y'all get to apply for the
federal and state disaster.
Other than the.
No,
that.
Uh,
I'm, thank you for the question.
The absolutely correct
will never be enough, and I
understand I used to be a er and
uh I got some
needs outside of the
um
explore federal funding.
programs
that is their sole source and
specific to your comment about
federal disaster assistance
um
for the
the the the best route is to get
money from
to submit an application for
assistance.
Um, and or
NRCS emergency program
are eligible for both of those
programs and
they will do
and they will do a repair
programs as well,
um,
and we asked them to provide
assistance and applying for
programs.
And
there's gaps
and up to this point, um, a lot
of of that 2255% cost has been
executive orders.
So, um.
For, for 99% of the time
do not disaster funding.
However, um, if there's gonna be
ongoing gaps they may be there's
a gap in the 25% cost
or if if there's something that
got left behind somehow, but I
mean, I, I agree with your
sentiments that that capitalli
should not be the primary source
and we need to leverage as much
of the federal money, uh, first.
Thank you and Madam Chair.
Uh,
a question on that.
We hear so much, and I'm not.
The
And, uh, applying for these
funds, but what is our luck at
getting the money on the ground
that in.
State from the federal lands.
Seems like it's pretty slow.
Madam Madam Chair of Mason, it,
it, it is slow and um I have a
firsthand experience. I'm from,
I'm from Mora, um, ourseki was
impacted and to give you a, a
case study of, of our experience
with our Osea. We, um, we have
different needs and we have to
apply to different programs. So,
um,
our gets silted in every time it
rains. So we hire a backhoe with
our own money.
And then we submit a claim to
the Herman's P Claims Office,
which it's unique to the
Hermit's Peak disaster, but we
can submit a claim for a
reimbursement of that, those
backho expenses or cascading
events.
And we haven't gotten paid yet,
so that's, that's, uh, issue
number 12, we have permanent,
um, what I would call, you know,
repair we permanent repairs that
are needed to the structures.
And we applied to NRCS for that.
And um the New Mexico
Association of Conservation
Districts is the, the partner
with NRCS along with DFA as the
sponsor to um to carry out that
program and you know, the, the
disaster was in 202. We're now
in 25. Um, they just recently
completed our design.
And our second met to uh to sign
off on the design and
construction might start in the
fall of 25.
So that's my personal
experience,
um, I think it's, um, it's
slower than most people would
like. Um, I also look at the
glass half full, um, in terms of
Um
The, the team that's in place at
uh NMACD and NRCS, uh, I think
they've worked very hard and I
think that disasters are
straining the capacity of the
state and the federal agencies
and, and so, uh, we're grateful
for the support. I, but I do
wish, you know, and everybody
wishes it was faster.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
And
Thank you for your presentation
at uh.
I mean we appreciate, I mean
that's just a long time to be
without a drink of water.
But uh I wish I knew a way to
tell you. 11 more quick
question, uh,
What are the are the executives.
It
Not executives.
Well
The water groups.
Uh
About fire prevention to help.
keep this from happening in the
future. We got some program
y'all have programs.
Out there that we're trying to.
Clean up
in County, um, the
In Taos County, the commission
and the administration are
working with the US Forest
Service, and they have been
working on within the forest
areas.
To
event for fires from happening
in the area, so they're doing
that in the Penasco area and in
the Questa area. And I think uh
it looks really good. I mean,
you feel comfortable. So we know
that at least there's some
prevention there.
Thank you for your presentation.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and good
luck in your recovery. Thank you
for your presentation.
Thank you. A quick reminder to
everyone after you speak, uh, be
sure to turn off your
microphone. Uh, we're, these are
new ones, that's always new
rules every year. So uh thank
you, uh, Vice Chair Sanchez.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I'd just
like to uh make a comment. I'd
like to thank Paula for her
years of uh advocacy for the
seals and everything she's done.
I'd also like to thank Mary, uh,
I don't know if people know
this, but my mom's from Penasco
and grew up with Mary. So these
stories about her uh.
Taking animals to the sec, uh,
uh,
I heard the same stories from my
mom and my father. Actually, my
mom and father met at the
Penasco fiestas when they're 14,
uh.
But uh I myself, I'm part of the
Secas and alcalde Penasco and
Velarde and Weyergate, uh, every
year, uh, so I really appreciate
what, what you guys do for us.
Uh, I myself, uh, I just wanna
thank Mary. She's always been an
advocate for traditional
Hispanic communities, and she's
a treastreasurer of Northern New
Mexico. So thank you for
everything you do. Um, you're
always fighting, fighting for
us. Uh, Paula as well, um.
I myself here is a a legislator,
uh, I've, I've tried as much as
I can as part of the, the
appropriations committee to help
get financing over the years and
I've been successful and I look
forward to
Continuing to help. So thank you
for, for everything you guys do.
Thank you. I have a couple of
questions myself. And first, I
do want to thank you all for
coming out and joining, um,
truly having all the support
here of everyone is just so
helpful and, and really this
presentation was phenomenal. I,
I appreciate all the maps and
all the, it really helps kind of
understand when you're, I joke
that when you're in this
building, you, you sometimes get
closed off. So kind of just
getting a moment to see what
spring looks like in various
parts is very helpful. Um, um,
uh, Chair Mascarenas, you had
mentioned that, uh, about, you
know, water and its importance
and healthy.
water, and I'm curious with all
of the fires that have taken
place, uh, what is the testing
look like? And I, and I
specifically refer to, you know,
the testing for PAS in the water
and other elements like that,
you know, to ensure that the
water is clean. How is, how is
PAS in general, but then also
after fires, you know, checking
to make sure that they're clean.
How's that process going?
Paula knows better about this
because we did not get fires
within our system as much as she
did. So we, we're not that
knowledgeable in that area.
But I'm sure Paula is because we
were all paying for Mora, and we
were all helping, and I'll tell
you what our people are dynamic,
they all came through and
helped, but I think she knows
more about this since she deals
with it every day.
Madam Chair, that's, that's a
really good question and it's,
that's one of the gaps in my
knowledge.
Um, it, it's something that
we've asked questions about and
uh the only the only interaction
I had with the environment
department was very early on in
the, in the recovery, uh, we
asked for an enemy's opinion on
whether the um
The debris that was coming off
the mountain was considered
hazardous waste, and the reason
we needed to know that is
because when we're doing debris
removal from the Asecas, and
there's these piles of, of ash
and debris.
Um
FEMA wanted to know if it was
hazardous, in which case it
would have to be hauled off to
uh to a landfill and the cost of
doing that would have been
between 5 and 10-fold.
To do the recovery and um
We were
Um
We were, we
Wanted to know if it was
hazardous.
enemy de informed us and they
rendered an opinion that it was
not considered hazardous waste
in part probably because the,
the mountain that burned didn't
have a lot of development and
there weren't a lot of homes and
I think where there are homes,
um, the, the, the burned debris,
uh, has more potential of adding
contamination to, to the runoff,
um.
And that's why the, the EPA and
and NMED they have um an entire
program and NMDOT around debris
removal around household waste.
So they try to get that removed
as soon as possible, so it's not
uh contributing to pollution.
Um, as far as POS, um, we
haven't gotten, um, any
definitive information and uh to
be honest with you, I think
we've been so focused on, on the
immediate um concern of, of
getting things back to normal
that, that, that's been a um
It hasn't been that the primary
focus of our advocacy, but it's
a good reminder now that you ask
the question that, that I'm
gonna look into it and, and get
back to you what I learned.
OK, yeah, sorry, go ahead.
Um, Madam Chair, um,
Director Paula.
Um, I just wanna make a note
that there are some communities
that are utilizing um community
water testing, nothing formal.
Um, I know in particular some
communities around Pecos um are
tied into say water sentinels.
They're doing some, some areas
around there. Um, so there is
independent water testing and
some quality water testing
there, but again, nothing,
nothing formal, more of an
instructured network. Um, if
anyone is interested out there,
you are able to sign up for to
be a personal advocate. They'll
work with you, they'll train you
to do.
water testing independently
teach you how, and that all
helps to go to the like a
statewide monitoring system that
is recognized um by many
organizations. So just want to
make a note that if, if any, um,
If any parent is not there,
anybody's interested in that
program. Um, I think that would
be a great tie in to talk about
at least to start level for, for
community uh and personal
advocacy water testing.
Me, if I might add to that.
Thank you, thank you,
Representative Gonzalez, um,
We did have a presentation from
the Water Sentinels at one of
our recent meetings and I, I,
it's a, it's a good program and
it's volunteer and it, but
there's training involved and
there's some resources when one
other thing I wanted to add
about NMED is that when, when we
looked into uh baseline data or
ongoing monitoring, um,
Enemy D.
Makes a plan of which areas
they're going to do this, this
monitoring and if you're not in
the plan, it's not happening in
your area. So, there wasn't any
baseline data and in our area,
so it would be, it would, and
there wasn't anything planned
for our area either. And, and so
it's not my area of expertise,
but um there's a lack of data in
the area of Hermit's Peak Ca
Canyon fire.
And the, the area in the area of
the um the Peco's watershed,
where the water sentinels are,
are working, you know, that
might be a good model that we
can implement and in the absence
of enemyD um water quality data.
Thank you both for that. That
was very helpful in
understanding. Um, last question
I had is, I don't think you
mentioned any particular bills
you anticipate that we should
keep an eye out, um, as you, you
know, 2 or 3 that you want to
mention now, um, that would be
helpful for us to keep an eye
out for.
Uh, I think we both, we both
would like to do that. And Mary,
uh, madam, um, Chairwoman
Mascarena has a handout from the
New Mexico Circuit Commission,
uh, that has our joint
priorities, and uh I'll mention
33 items, um, one of them is,
uh, a collaboration with the La
Grants. It hasn't been
introduced yet, but there will
be an infrastructure bill
dealing with land grants and
the, um, that is forthcoming and
um um it's.
It's uh being drafted, so it's
an infrastructure bill, you
know, that seeks to um establish
another revenue stream for a
second and land grant
infrastructure. So that's on its
way, and it'll probably come to
this committee, so, uh, stay
tuned. Uh, we're excited about
that one. the New Mexicose
mission is working to build
capacity. So that's uh, the
other #2 issue, um, there're uh
working to um have some staff.
Uh, right now, it's, it's not a
staffed commission, and there,
there's a lot of work to do on a
sec, uh,
we do have different roles that
are complementary and um and our
leadership on both bodies is
very supportive of having more
capacity at the commission, um,
to give an example now in the
disasters, um, when we needed an
agency to be a voice for sea's,
um uh we would uh
You know, fill in as much as we
could, but it would be helpful
to have a partner in the
commission with staff to, to
carry on that kind of advocacy
and representation. Um,
Additionally, we have the um a
second community infrastructure
fund, um, where we're seeking to
increase that recurring
appropriation.
And um
The, uh
What if I have to pick 3, we
have a, a special appropriation
request, um, that would, um,
help ase with federal state cost
share.
And there are various federal
programs that, that are
available to us, I guess, the
Army Corps of Engineers, but it
has a 9010 cost share. So the
state has to provide the 10% for
disasters. It's a 75, 25 cost
share. um NMACD just got a $15
million federal grant to help
Aseass, and we're hoping to
match that 50, you know, 50-50
over the next 3 years. So the
$10 million is really meant to
leverage federal funding.
And those are, um, those are
some of our priorities, Madam
Chair. Thank you for asking.
And I just uh
I just like to continue and say
that you got some handouts, I
believe, and I'll just mention
the bills HB 25 sponsored by uh
representative Garcia, uh, to
the position for NMAC is
increased recurring funding from
88,100 to 390,000 for
operations.
Uh, as they infrastructure
funding, which you mentioned 10
million special appropriations
for ISC for statewide projects
cost share, uh ACDF
appropriation bill increasing
funding from ACDF to NMNDA from.
8000 or 8 million.
800,000 to 2 million ACDIF bill
increased recurring funding from
I ISC from 2.5 million to 5
million annually and then the
last one is ACDEP bill codify
ACDP and DFA local government
division.
And I'd also like to say that we
had our first snowfall of the
winter in Taos County last
night.
And um
We are, uh, you know, we were
playing for rain, we were
playing for snow because it is
so dry, so you, that's why you
see a lot of need for all these
things because it's been very
dry. People are very, very
worried because that's where
fires can begin and then uh we
have no production for animals
or for people, and so that's why
we come to you where we know
that we can get help.
Thank you both so much for the
presentations and, uh, you know,
I hope we can continue to work
together on a lot of these
issues, um, uh.
I definitely be following up
with those of you. Thank you so
much.
More more representation here in
the back.

Thank you.
Next up we have
Uh, yeah, next up we have Arturo
Archuleta with uh the land
grants, the Nexo Land Grants
Council. Uh, he'll be providing
a presentation as well.
Mr. Drulette, I believe we all
have our handouts now, so uh if
you'd like to begin.
Thank you.
When I lays, thank you, Madam
Chair, members of the committee,
uh, my name again is Arturo
Archle. I work for the New
Mexico Land Grant Council. I'm
the director there and the
director of the Langren Merced
Institute out of the University
of New Mexico.
I appreciate the opportunity to
do this presentation for you all
this morning just to give you
sort of a background and
overview, um, you know, this is
a, a long area of history I'm
covering I wanted to be mindful
of your time. So what is your,
um, what is the the the time you
guys need to be done, so I just
make sure I
I believe it's 10:30. So I
believe we have about 45
minutes. Yeah. Perfect. I can, I
can keep this, um,
To a minimum, um,
So,
We are going to be covering a a
a broad history, so it's gonna
be very so uh a broad overview
land grants exist here, uh, in
New Mexico for
Several centuries and so.
Um, I'm not gonna be able to
touch on everything, but I want
to at least give you all some
background and then talk about
sort of more of the modern
trends and what's happening with
land grants today. Uh, so just
to sort of begin, uh,
The broad definition of what a
land grant me said is, um, these
are, uh, it's a term that's used
to refer to uh lands that were
granted either under the Spanish
crown or the Mexican government,
um, to either recognize existing
communities or establish a new
settlements here, uh, in what is
now actually New Mexico,
Arizona, and Southern Colorado.
Um, and so there's actually land
grants also in Texas and in
California all throughout the
Southwest, the largest
concentration of community land
grants was actually here in New
Mexico.
Um, and there's, there was a
sort of a difference between uh
lands that were granted to
individuals, uh, for service,
for example, to the crown or to
the government, uh, and then
land grants that were
established to for communities
as a whole, right? And so
there's kind of that distinction
that has been made historically,
um, even though land grants that
were granted, given to
individuals, they still had the
duty to actually settle
communities. Um, that was sort
of the intention.
And so, um, oftentimes,
sometimes you gotta really look
to see, well, is this a
community grant, was this a uh
individual that then actually
converted to a community once
people were on the ground and
settled.
Uh, land grants sort of have
this, um,
Common feature of common lands
and common waters, and so land
grant communities were when when
established included uh not only
private tracks within the
community for individuals to
have their homes, their house
plots, private, you know, small
gardens, um, they also included
uh common lands that surrounded
the communities and that were
intended to sort of sustain
those communities, uh, and is,
um,
Paul Garcia mentioned um those
were sort of considered communal
resources. Now these actually
have a long history that goes
back, um, to the
Medieval times, uh, 1100, um,
uh, some of the things that were
happening in Spain at that time
in terms of the structures of
laws and communal ownership of
properties and local governance
structures, um, and then also uh
here in New Mexico since time
immemorial, you've had communal
um lands with some of the pueblo
uh communities.
Um, or Pueblo, uh, brothers and
sisters and the Native American
tribes in terms of sort of their
management and ownership
patterns of lands.
Um
So when lands were granted here
in New Mexico, they were granted
to uh primarily to communities
and a lot of them were actually
settled by um either mestizo
communities which were are a
mixed uh Native American, uh,
and, you know, there wasn't a
ton of folks who were, you could
say were pure blooded European,
so they came here, um,
oftentimes it was folks who are
already either mestizo mixed or
um as well as genisaros, which
were a full-blooded Native
Americans um who had sort of
been to tribalized.
had become Hispanicized, right?
So a lot of our communities um
that exist uh were treated with
folks from those populations,
um, and establishing communities
throughout the state.
When they were originally
granted, they ranged in size
anywhere from 10s of thousands
of acres to 100s of thousands of
acres. Um, the initial land
grants that were created um were
about 17,000 acres in size. Um,
it's been come to known, become
known as a Pueblo League, which
was essentially one league, um,
in every cardinal direction from
the center point, usually like
the village plaza, the church,
um, and so that encompassed
about 17,000 acres. Um, as time
moved on, the land grants grew
bigger, uh, particularly when
there was uh pressures.
From the United States sort of
expansion west, some of the
grants got larger in size and,
you know, an attempt to sort of
spur more development um and
settlements in those areas.
So the settlement period is
actually between 1692 and 1852,
um, where you actually have land
grants recognized the reason it
goes into 1852, um, is because
Even though in 1848, the
majority, vast majority of the
Southwest goes changes
sovereignty with the to the
United States, um, there's still
some land grants that were
granted in Las Cruces in that
area that were part of the Gats
and Purchase on the Gatton Purch
just didn't happen until later.
And so when that happened, those
communities um that were being
granted under Mexico, uh, became
a part of the United States as
well, um, and by that treaty,
they were also pulled into um
the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo,
which I'll talk about here in a
little bit.
There's a total of 154, what we
would call community grants. Um,
there was, as you saw about 295
total land grants, um, 154 of
those is what we classify as
community grants, um, and 141 of
those were individual grants.
Uh, these included these 154
included the 23 um Indian pueblo
grants that were granted here in
New Mexico, um, and so those
were part of those community
grants. They were those ones
were the ones that recognized
settlements that already
existed. Um.
And then we had uh the
Majority of those were settled
during the Spanish period um
'82, uh and then 49 of those
were issued during the Mexican
period.
So as I mentioned in in 1846,
when the United States invaded
um what is now the Southwest,
um, and declared war, uh, there
was a two-year period on where
New Mexico was under the civil
law of the attorney code, um,
and at that time there was sort
of a recognition of the fact
that the communities were here
and a recognition of of property
rights and protection of, um,
sort of, uh, liberties um for
those communities. And then the,
the war culminated in 1848 with
the signing of the Treaty Guad
Hidalgo, uh.
Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo did
contain provisions, um.
To protect uh the property
interests and rights of those
folks who remained in what now
became the uh territory of New
Mexico.
And so there was some um
requirements under that.
Uh, and that little map kind of
just shows the area that was
transferred. Um, so you can see,
um, Mexico lost essentially like
half of its land base became
part of what is now um the
southwestern United States.
And at that time, New Mexico,
uh, as I mentioned, had the
largest population and and the
most settlement. I think there
was about 80,000 people were in
New Mexico and you compare that
with uh like California, which
was another sort of area that
was settled, um, in that
population, I think it was
around 10,000.
Uh, so this is really the most
populous area um during that
time period.
Uh, so with that, um, there was
a, a process of adjudication
that was required under the
treaty to recognize some of
those land claims, um, for
communities here in New Mexico,
uh, and one of the immediate
sort of issues was um how
American jurisprudence would
recognize and understand how
this ownership pattern, which
was something that was very
common, um,
through Spain and sort of the,
their common laws, um, and that
system of being a civil law
system to the United States that
had a very different
understanding of how property
worked and was viewed, um, and
so that process took 50 years.
It was two separate processes.
One was the severe general
process that ran from 1854 to
1891, uh, and then you had the
quarter private land claims um
from 1891 to 1904, um, and the
Court of Private land claims was
actually created as a result of
some of the inequities and and
some of the um land speculation
and
that folks were taking advantage
of the surveyor general process.
There was a lot of um
territorial officials who came
in and who um recognized that
they could take advantage of um
sort of an, an ill-equipped
system for recognizing land
titles, and some of those claims
that they made were actually
overinflated, um.
And was were claiming lands that
um
We're probably not likely even
communal lands originally, um,
and as a part of that result,
um.
What you end up having happened
is the federal government starts
taking more of a lead in actual
adversarial relationship to say
we got to preserve as much lands
as we can. And so today, a lot
of what became the US Forest
Service lands in New Mexico
started off originally as common
lands that were um converted
into federal public domain.
Uh, this picture here is
actually the quarter private
land claims I got um I have a
beard or mustache envy of the
gentleman sitting on there
right.
I can't grow that kind of hair,
facial hair. Um.
So
One of the things that happened
with adjudication though, is
that there was it settled sort
of title issues in terms of
recognition of who had title
claims to land, but it didn't
deal with um what does that mean
in terms of structure. And there
was actually some problems with
the, even the adjudication
process in terms of recognizing
title in that we had uh some
land grants that were properly
recognized as like the town of,
so they recognize, hey, there's
a corporate entity, the town of
Chilile, for example, the town
of Las Vegas was one, the town
of
Toma, where the United States
issued a patent and, and, and it
was confirmed to a community. So
they said, oh, here's a
community that has in the
ownership is vested in this sort
of corporate entity, um, similar
to a municipality, right?
It was a municipal corporation,
um, but then because of land
speculation, you also had a
shift um where they started
recognizing community land
grants as tenancies in common,
where they said, oh, these are
all everybody in the community
has an ownership interest in
this, and that was a sort of a
way of recognizing um
Um, private individual property
rights. And with that led land
grant susceptible to was
partition suits, um, where you
would get individuals who would
usually it was the attorneys who
represented the land grants
would either get an interest as
part of their reputation
representation agreement or
without right just buy an
interest and then they would
force a partition sale.
And um through the courts and
purchase uh for sale of all the
common lands, and then they
would come in and purchase
those. So you have communities
divested of their resources
almost immediately, um.
And because there was this gap
in terms of well, what happens
in terms of management and how
are these lands managed either
for the towns that were
recognized properly as Tao of
grants or the ones that were
these tenancy in commons that
now have
multiple owners who have to sort
of manage these communal
resources, the territorial
legislature as early as 1874
started passing legislation for
the governance of land grant
communities, uh, and it started
off individually where they were
passing a statute specifically
for this is for the town of Las
Vegas. This one is for the
community of Sevieta, this one,
and so it was, you know,
piecemeal.
And then the legislature
realized that was probably an
inefficient process, um, and as
early as 1891, which is
interestingly coincides with the
quarter private land claims.
They started making uh
legislation that was more
encompassing. So they started
they what we now call Article 2,
in the gent land grant
provisions, statutes, um, they
created legislation specifically
for the town of Grants, um, and
then in 1907 at the end, they
created legislation um known as
what we call the general
provisions.
Which were supposed to be the
catch all for any land grant
that wasn't covered by any other
statute, you would now be
governed by the land grant
general provisions, um, and that
was in 1907.
After 1907, the land grant
statutes were incorporated into
statehood in 1812, and they
essentially became part of
The um state law, and there was
very little changes that took
place uh between 1907 and, and
2000s, there was a lot. There
was a lot of changes happening
in the communities, but there
wasn't too much change that took
place with regard to the um
statutes themselves. And so what
that meant is that uh oftentimes
how laws affecting land grants
were shaped or through the
courts. So they became more
affected by common land, I mean,
common law, excuse me, by common
law decisions of the courts, uh,
in terms of recognizing, well
what
Exactly how is the statute
interpreted? What is exactly
their governance capacity? What
exactly is their ownership
interest in the common lands.
Um, and so that proved to be
also a bit detrimental for
communities. So in 2003, as a
result of advocacy from local
land grant communities, uh,
grassroots efforts, um, there
was the creation of the land
grant interim committee, uh,
which is a committee that was
tasked with specifically looking
at the land grant issue and some
of these injustices to determine
what do we do to, from policy
perspective, what can the
legislature do to
recognize um these communities
and and assist them to sort of
be a good stewards of the land
and help them to sort of support
their communities. Oftentimes,
um, our land grant leadership or
um the only structure and units
of government now, local units
of government that are within
their rural communities. Um, we
do have a shared history with
Esequia, as Paula mentioned, um,
a lot of times we have the same
asea leaders can also be a board
of trustee members on the land
grant. Um, so these are like,
you know, volunteer elected
officials who are pulling double
duty.
Well, in 2004, 1 thing that was
done is overhaul of the general
provisions, and that recognized
land grants as political
subdivisions as properly as
government entities. Prior to
that, the courts had divide the
Determined land grants to be
quasi municipal entities,
meaning that they were
semi-public, semi-private, uh,
and it kind of any time that it
would have probably benefited
the community to be recognized
as being public. They said no,
they're private and if there was
probably their benefit to be
recommended as private, they
said, no, these guys are public,
um, so it kind of created um a
bit of an issue for communities.
So, uh, the 2004 overhaul
corrected a lot of those issues
or began the correction process,
and the first most important one
was Gibe La Grant's political
subdivision status, um, as well
as
zoning authority over their
common lands.
Um, in 2009, the New Mexico Land
Grant Council was created. Uh,
this is a 5 member, uh, council
that is appointed by the
governor, uh, the council
members themselves, um, in order
to be appointed, you have to
serve on a board of trustees of
one of the land grants here in
New Mexico.
Um, and that council's statutory
mission is to provide a program
to support for land grant
communities, um, as well as
service and liaison with other
state, federal, and local
government entities, and that's
a lot of the work that we do um
through the New Mexico Land
grant Council, and part of the
program of support that we've
established is um technical
assistance. I know um last time
I was here I talked about some
of the assistance we provide
land communities with financial
compliance and those things. Um,
we also provide uh legal
assistance.
Services to Lang communities.
Um, they've been marginalized
and underserved population for,
for decades, um, and so this is
sort of uh assisting them and
providing them with the services
they need to both protect their
common lands and then also
ensure that they're having good
uh governance and structure and
processes, and we also provide
surveying services um as a way
to help them sort of protect the
communal assets, um, and, uh, we
hope to expand and grow, and one
of the challenges that we've
had, um, has just been, um, in
the past couple of years is our
budget has sort of stayed flat.
So, um, we haven't had any
budgetary increases, so we, um,
you know, our hopes and
expansion and and continuing to
grow is to provide actual
community planners. I know that
was a question that um
Representative Mason had about
what can we do to help these
land grants be more
self-sufficient and not
necessarily rely on just
distributions, and part of that
is helping them grow on these
communal projects and economic
and community development. So,
you know, we're hoping that in
the future as we get more
resources, we can bring on
community planners to help them
manage projects, apply for
federal funds, apply for other
op
communities, um, private
foundation funds to actually do
some of the work that's
important and necessary and
utilize the funds that they
receive from the assistance
fund, um, as matching dollars to
help leverage that and, and
further um provide opportunities
for their communities. Um, 2022
was a big kind of game changer
cause that was the creation of
the land grant Merced Assistance
Fund that we talked about here
last time, uh, and then 2023.
The land grant general
provisions were amended to
specifically name land grants.
One of the issues with it as
being a general provision is
that it wasn't always entirely
clear as to which land grants
fell within that. So you might
have had land grants that
operated in accordance with it,
but they weren't specifically
named because it was never
intended to be a uh a piece of
uh law that named each
individual was that it was the
catch all. Um, and so as land
grants have shrunk in terms of
the number, and we can now be
very definite about which land
grants exist and so of those
1030
54 original community land
grants, um, excluding the
pueblo, so 132 um community guns
that were non Pueblo, there's
about 35 that are still in
existence today.
Those 35 are not all organized
as units of government. Some of
them have organized uh as uh
like associations or cooperative
structures and that was the way
they were able to sort of work
through um the gaps in the
statutes as well as the um
issues relating to
interpretations by the court to
sort of protect and manage those
resources.
But of the land grants that of
those approximate 35 land grants
that are in existence, 27 of
those are currently named in
statute as political
subdivisions of the state, the
local units of government, um,
and oftentimes they're the only
local unit of government um that
can provide services in their
local uh radius. And so, um, in
here is a list of all those land
grants that are currently
political subdivisions of the
state because of that change in
2023 in order for a land grant
to get that recognition now,
this legislative body has to
an action and actually naming
them. So we do have one bill
this session, Senate Bill 47,
that's actually looking to
recognize um one of the land
grants that exists, but that
doesn't currently have
government political subdivision
status, and that's the Santa
Cruz de la Cannada land grant um
near Espanola.
Um, land grants as they exist
today, uh still manage common
lands, they still, um, and
sometimes they're in more than
one county just because of the
geographic locations were prior
to the county geographic sort of
because they predate the state
and the county system. So we do
have some land grants um that
actually have common lands in
more than one county, so they
also have to work with their
local counties and, and it
varies. We have land grants that
are in about 12 counties
throughout the state of New
Mexico that are active, uh, in
those counties, some land grants
have great relationships.
with their local counties where
they actually sort of take on
some of the responsibilities.
You know, we have counties that
are also very resource strapped,
and so, um, some of these
counties that had, for example,
community centers that they were
having trouble struggling to
maintain. They've been able to
turn those over and transfer
them to the land grant
communities and the land grants
are able to manage those and,
and maintain those um for the
benefit of the local community
and it alleviates some of the
stress on the county. Um, we
have other counties that, um,
just worked very little with the
land grants, and they.
really have a relationship. Uh,
it just varies from community to
community, um, but here's the
current list of the land grants
that are political subdivisions.
Uh, as I mentioned.
All the land grants today are
governed by state law under
chapter 49. There's actually 11
different articles in that
chapter of the law, um, two of
those recognized Lares political
subdivisions. The general
provisions, which has 26 are
under that, and then the Chilili
land grant um is its own sort of
has its own specific statute,
but it is a political
subdivision. It's statute
essentially mirrors, um, the
general provisions, uh, but they
were one of those statute
specific land grants who um just
wanted to maintain their statue.
in the legislature recognized
that they that they could do
that and they sort of created
them as a political subdivision
in their own statute. Um, the
rest of the provisions that are
statute-specific, we've actually
had two land grants that have
repealed their individual
statute and had been pulled into
491. Um, that's the Monzano and
the Tecolote land grants, um,
and so there's 6 other articles
that uh recognize other
governance structures. So for
example, the Las Vegas land
grant is a statute specific
grant, um, and that land grant,
curiously enough, is
The board of trustees is
appointed by the 4th Judicial
District. It's a really weird
anomaly because it's kind of
like a mix of, you have a court
that appoints the the board of
trustees and so they're not
elected and they're um all the
other land grants that are
political subdivisions, they're
actually locally elected
officials, so they have to have
elections, um, every, at least
every 4 years, uh, and they can
sit in their bylaws whether they
do them, you know, 2 or 4 years
staggered, uh.
And and um that's how sort of
the locally elected. So they are
local, local elected bodies.
And then Article 11, as I
mentioned, established the
council and the nursed
assistance fund.
So some of the general
authorities um that are granted
to land grants under the 491 is
First of all, all of the
management authorities vested in
the land grant Merced board of
trustees, um.
And they have to manage in
accordance with their bylaws. So
land grants are required to have
a set of bylaws that are
required to, um, you know,
adhere to those, that's kind of
like their little mini uh
governance structure, their
little constitution.
Uh, and then you have the board
of trustees, um, that oversees
and manages their 5 member board
of trustees that are elected.
They control, care for the
manager of the common lands, and
all of the assets. This includes
both the common lands and the
common waters in statute. So as
Paula mentioned, there is a
shared history there, um, with
land grants and asseass. We do
have land grants that actually
own water rights that are like
irrigation rights, like a a
separiante, for example, that
they actually have irrigable
lands, but we also have uh
common waters that exist that
are like this natural springs,
um, they use them maybe for the
livestock, um, uh, drinkers, um,
and these are all waters
oftentimes we're working towards
getting, making sure they get
them declared, but some of these
waters were never declared the
pre-1907 rights, but they just
weren't. So in some of these
areas, let's say that have been
adjudicated, you know, those,
that opportunity is sort of pass
them if they weren't owners of a
water right on paper in the same
way as like an irrigator, um,
but in other parts of the state,
we still have land grants that
manage those resources.
is, um, and so to the extent of
what that looks like uh in terms
of their authority over the
common waters is still an area
that we've we're we're
exploring.
Um, they can adopt and make
rules and regulations uh for the
management of the common lands.
As I mentioned, they can
determine zoning of the common
lands, uh, and then they can
also enter into memorandums of
understanding, contracts and
agreements with other local,
state, or federal government
entities. We do do a lot of work
with some of our federal agency
partners in terms of the US
Forest Service, the Bureau of
Land Management.
Um
Those that manage former common
lands, uh, a lot of land grants,
board of trustees will work with
them on any access and ensuring
access for traditional uses, um,
for example, big in our
communities is, is uh timber,
right? As most of you, if you're
from a rural community, you know
propane is expensive. Um, a lot
of our communities are able to
supplement uh and get by in the
winters by having access to fuel
wood resources, um, and it
becomes more of a challenge for
these land grants that don't
have common lands, that don't
have forested um uh lands.
They still maintain and so we
have to do a partnerships with,
uh, not even, uh, just the feds,
we also work a lot with the
state. We've worked well with
the state land office on some
you what projects for local
communities, um, as well as with
the US Forest Service and the
Bureau of Land Management.
Uh, land grants are government
entities, so they do have the
same obligations as the other
local governments. They have to
comply with the Open Meetings
Act.
The inspection of Public Records
Act. They all, they, they have
to comply with the state audit
Act, as I mentioned last time
they submit budgets annually to
the Department of Finance and
Administration, uh, they have to
submit quarterly reporting, um,
as well as report to the land
grant registry every time they
have a bylaw change or um they
have a new election and that way
we can uh keep up to-date record
of what land grants, uh, who
they elected officials are on
land grants. Um, they also have
some protections that are
covered by the Tort Claims Act
as, as a unit of government, uh,
they have the ability
to purchase uh risk land uh risk
or tort liability waiver
coverage from the risk
management division under the
General Services department. Uh,
they are exempt from the New
Mexico Civil Rights Act, um, the
some changes to the statutes um
provide some additional
protections for the common lands
that they still maintain, um,
they're no longer subject to
risk from adverse possession,
uh, or, um, quite title claims.
And then, you know, when we
Talk about, as I mentioned, the
modern role of land grant
communities. It really is, um,
it really has changed. It's not
just about managing land, it's
about also providing services
for the local communities. So we
do have land grants, for
example, that have the local
community center. Um, some land
grants, that's all they have
left is maybe the sender and a
couple of acres, uh, but they
managed that center for, you
know, local community resources,
whether it be local youth
programming, um,
Senior senior services. We have
a land grant, um, in San Miguel
County that provides the uh meal
site for senior meals um for the
little for the valley there in
San Miguel, um, and so, you
know,
As land grants have grown and
have got more access to
resources. They continue to
reinvest in those local
communities and provide support
that's needed and, and
oftentimes just not there.
Um, including, um, affordable
housing. We have land grants
that are engaged in developing
affordable housing
opportunities uh for their
communities, infrastructure
development, a lot of times the
land grants run the water
systems, um, we actually have
one land grant that has both
water and wastewater, uh,
systems, um, and as well as the
economic development
opportunities, cultural
preservation. We have some
couple land grants that actually
have museums, um, where they do
cultural preservation. Um, we
have land grants that are
engaged in ensuring that
farming continues, uh, and as
they utilize their common land
to sort to be able to continue
communal farming opportunities
for young farmers who maybe
don't have access, um, and sort
of protection of those water
rights. So, um, it's a vast sort
of wide array of things that
land grant communities engage in
all as volunteers, um.
With the support of the council,
and I, and I guess what I could
do, um, is give you the list of
the priorities if you, if you
wanna, if you want me to now,
um, we do have several bills,
you guys heard two of them, uh,
last time, um, HB 25, which uh
was referred to. That's actually
the bill that's now gonna
combine um with the eas. So it
started out as a, a sec
infrastructure fund um for
targeting just the land grant
communities, but we worked with
the communities and said, yeah,
let's just make this one fun
that makes more sense. You can
kill two birds with one stone
and
provide some of those resources,
um, land grants probably have in
the, or they do have in the tens
of millions, just like Osea in
terms of some of those
infrastructure needs, um, and it
does provide a burden on some of
these rule legislators to have
to also try to um occupy both
providing for the counties, the
municipalities, and all these
little entities, uh, and an
infrastructure fund for land
grants and assekis would help
because we wouldn't have to then
bother individual legislators
for money that would free up
their capital dollars to put
into other projects, and we can
focus on just
applying for those monies from
that fund.
Um
The other, uh, bill, as I
mentioned, the Senate Bill 47,
uh, to recognize the Santa Cruz
de la Cannada La Grant, which
will probably come before this
committee once it crosses
chambers. Um, there's also a
House Bill 128, which is the
solar access fund, uh, it's a
bill to create um a solar access
fund for doing solar renewable
energy projects, uh, in local
communities and land grants
would be one of those eligible
entities, um, and, and this
would be helpful for us in some
of, you know, it would help cut
costs, operating costs for some
of our community centers, uh, it
could provide opportunities.
For land grants to be able to
sort of generate some of that,
um, local energy uh and not have
to rely on, um
On, on an electric bill each
month.
Uh, and with that, Madam Chair,
I will stand for any questions.
Thank you so much, Mr.
Archuleta. You know, it's funny,
I was on this committee as a
freshman and I, we'd worked
together years ago on these
issues and I was like, I want to
refresh and I I emailed the
library, I said, can you give me
a summary, a good reference
point for, for land grants. They
said, yes, here's 500 pages to
study and I was like, I only
have 60 days in a session. I got
another committee too. So I
appreciate you summarizing so
rapidly. That was, that was
wonderful and, and I hope, you
know, we'll continue to look to
you as a resource on some of
these key issues. Um, I turned
to the committee, are there any
questions?
Representative Gonzalez.
Um, not necessarily a question,
just a very quick comment. Um,
just want to thank you for their
work. Again, as I mentioned, um,
with the previous presentation,
I am a a len Granera on the San
Miguel the the land grant, um,
and, as a matter of personal
privilege, Madam Chair, I can
just take a quick minute to
recognize, uh, West Las Vegas
High School who did up in the
room. Many of these students
here are, are, are heirs also on
the Las Vegas land grant, the
Tecolote land grant, and also as
well as the San Miguel devado.
So thank you so much.
Representative Gonzalez.
Representative McCullen. I just
wanted to say thank you so much
for the learning more about land
and it's uh this is a great
resource and thinking the same
thing, get a book and start
reading and really kind of
refreshing, yeah, 60 days is
kind of a short time to to do
that, so thank you, madam, it'll
make you a binder.
Yeah, yeah, exactly,
um, I had a, there are other
questions. I had a quick
question as well, um, you know,
you mentioned all the roles that
Lagrats take in these
communities, and I was curious,
you know, we have, we passed HP
195 last year to expand the
opportunity enterprise board and
fund to also support housing.
Uh, within the housing aspect of
it, um, the statute puts in
there that, you know, for zoning
laws, uh, you know, there's
preferred.
Um, development for, uh, zoning
laws that are complimentary for
for long term building out and
everything like that. And I'm
curious, again, of course, it
affects all, uh, you know,
political subdivisions and other
groups as well, um, and I'm just
kind of curious in terms of
that, that piece, you know, what
are the actions that land grants
have been taking in affordable
housing. Now, how have they been
experiencing the zoning aspect
for affordable housing as well.
Thank you, man. I'm sure that's
a great question. Um,
And the, the best example I can
give you and the one that's most
advanced is the Shailly land
grant, and the Chitilli land
grant, it's curious because it
actually sits between two
counties. It has common lands in
Torrance County and common lands
in Bornoo County, um, and if you
could, I guess a tale of two
counties in terms of like how
that has has worked. So first
off, as I mentioned, the land
grants themselves have the
authority to zone, so that's not
an issue for them. Um, you know,
they just have to do a
comprehensive management plan
and then they can zone and so um
in Chile's instance, you know,
they, they, they did a
planning the identified the
areas that they wanted to
utilize for developing housing
developments. On the first go at
it, we actually receive
community development block
grant funds of federal dollars
to provide infrastructure, um,
to establish uh a development,
um, and so that allowed them to
bring in um the infrastructure
of the water, the electricity
and all those um to develop sort
of home sites, um, and then the
challenge that they ran into was
they couldn't get lenders to
lend folks dollars to actually
build their homes.
Because they're like, well, it's
a, it's a, it's a lease, it's a
long term lease, it's common
land, um, there was, you know,
issues about how do, how do we,
and so we, we tried to work with
with mortgage finance Authority
and try to figure out like what
are the, the ways around this.
And in the end because it was
taking so long, what they ended
up doing is they just said,
well, if, if airs can go out and
they can get uh prefabricated
homes and they can get loans,
and those were pretty uh
available for them. They were
able to do that and so that was
kind of that first phase of
development, that filled up
almost right away. Um, they
encouraged the
the individuals if they wanted
to like, you know, um, permanent
foundation and delete the title,
those kind of things to then
seek uh refinance if that was an
issue that was needed down the
road. Uh, it hasn't seemed to
sort of appear.
Um, and then they kind of
they've expanded into another
housing development, and now
they've kind of crossed over
where they're trying to do work
on one in Torrance County, um,
Berlio County essentially just
sort of said do what you want to
do, just let us know what you're
doing, uh, in Torrance County,
they've now kind of said, well,
you guys have to follow our
subdivision rules. We're not
gonna give you E 911, um,
addressing until you guys comply
with the subdivision Act, which
you have to go through our sort
of county stuff and so um that's
has provided some challenges and
it's slowed it a little bit. And
one of the things that we're
hoping to, um, and it
It hasn't been introduced yet.
It got endorsed by the land
grant Interim Committee, but it
was actually a bill that would
exempt um land grants from the
uh New Mexico Subdivision acts,
the same way that it exempts
like municipalities. They just,
they're just, they can do their
own, they just have to sort of
have whatever the criteria and
processes, um, but it's
currently not uh something
that's been introduced, so that
may be a future bill that maybe
come across this committee if we
um figure out sort of um the
sponsors um and and sort of the
introduction. It was just a
little bit of a of a mix up, I
think when it got endorsed and
so I got to just do some follow
up with um.
Uh, the potential sponsor to see
if we can get that introduced.
Uh, so that's been the one
challenge and if I think we can
get over that hurdle, that would
sort of clear the way for them,
um, because even though they're
not in their mind, they're not
subdividing the land, right?
Because it's still like one
large parcel of common on that
they're um
Dividing, I guess, on paper to
say here's the, you know, here's
the individual plots within this
area, they're not actually
dividing those up into separate
plots of land. Um, and so it's a
little bit different, but the
county recognizes that's a, you
know, division of, of the land.
Um, and then the other thing is
the financing, right? Like we're
still gonna work on that as land
grants, Julie's figured out a
pretty good model like we just
kind of do it, we put the
infrastructure and we um and we
we're hoping to sort of build
off of that for other
communities that sort of have
some of these housing needs.
A bit of a separate question
also Mr. Chueta. I believe
yesterday or last time you, uh,
when you're here presenting on
one of the bells, I believe one
of the witnesses mentioned that
they were a landless, part of
landless land grant. Can you
explain how that kind of fits
into all the structure or what,
what that means? Yeah, sure, um.
Sorry, I left my mic on. Uh,
the, um,
The
So, because of the adjudication
process and then what happened
post adjudication because some
of them were identified as
tendencies in common, um, they
were subject to a lot of land
loss, right? You had partition
suits, you had some of them lost
it to Daxas, the state of New
Mexico, once they were sort of
patented, started uh charging
taxes and what ended up
happening is like in the 1930s,
um, the state said uh state tax
commission said we got a chance
to text you guys because you
guys are, you know, an entity,
still weren't sure what kind of
entity, but they said we
got to tax these lands and they
tax them all the way back to the
pan. So let's say they received
the patent in 1908 and it was
now 1928. They said, oh you guys
0 uh 20 years of taxes, so
almost immediately, most of them
went into default or they had to
sell some of the land in order
to pay the taxes on the lands
that we're going to try to keep.
Um, and this, you know, the
importance of the land is also
the watersheds. Um, they
maintain, we do a lot of
projects with forest restoration
and trying to maintain healthy
watersheds to, not just for the
local community but as a benefit
to the state as a whole, right?
Um, and so,
The, uh
Those land grants that lost
lands, some of them ended up
with
And they're most landgas aren't
technically land grant or at
that loss because they're still
within these, there's a lot of
unidentified parcels, like in
any rural community, you're
gonna have these unidentified
parcels. Those were all
patented, those all are are
common land, um, but whether or
not they're accessible or
whether or not they're
recognized at the county levels,
one question. I mean then
because some land grants just
lost their, their land base, um,
the ones that have maybe a
community center and a couple of
acres, um, those are what we're
sort of talking about um the
land grants that have sort of
lost and so they still have a
of like, how do we continue to
maintain if they lost it, for
example, to the feds, if the
vast majority, um, there was a
case in 1897, the US versus
Sandoval case, with the Supreme
Court decided um that land,
common lands did not belong to
the individual communities, but
actually belong to the
sovereign, and so therefore when
Mexico transferred the land to
the United States, it became
part of the public domain. This
is what I was talking about,
about creating the Forest
Service plans, and so you have
communities like Cornel, for
example, where they said, which
is in Tijeras Canyon.
I'm just east of Albuquerque,
where the the they were affected
by the decision and what the
court did is said, well, if it's
private land, it's individual
land that's not part of the
public domain, but if it's
anything else, it is, but they
couldn't really identify, so
they just said, OK, everybody in
Cornwell, you guys all have the
land owned in common even though
there was homes on each one and
they have individual parcels,
um, and within that were some
scattered common lands, um, but
that's one way where they lost
the vast majority and so um if
those little bits that they had
then
became privatized over time,
that's how they became sort of
landless, but they still have an
interest in working with the
federal government and accessing
those former common lands for
accessing fuel wood and other
resources that they can get.
Thank you so much for that
explanation, that, that helps a
lot, um, with, I think that's
all the questions we have today
for you, but we will continue to
look to you for as a, as a
support and everything else. So,
and asking for more 500 pages uh
pieces. Uh, with that, we're,
we're going to be adjourned. I
just want to remind everyone, we
have a committee meeting on
Tuesday at 9, we have a couple
of bills we're expecting and
floor does start at 10:30. Thank
you, everybody.
