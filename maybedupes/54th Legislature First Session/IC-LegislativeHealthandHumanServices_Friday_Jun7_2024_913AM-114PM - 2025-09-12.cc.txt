It's already
915.
>> And then that is
the
one
I'm just scared
that
good morning. Good
morning.
>> Good morning, everyone. I think
we, we probably ought to get
started with. We're a
little behind schedule,
but, um, we
don't have a lot of
items today, but we do want to
make sure we give
the committee a chance to ask
whatever questions they have after
your, your presentation.
So
we're going to start by
letting
the members who are
new here today
and I see
two that are
new here today that haven't had a chance
to introduce themselves yet.
So, Representative
Chasey and Senator
Zio Lopez, why don't we start
with Senator Seo
Lopez? And then
>> thank you, Mr Chair. My name is
Antoinette Zio Lopez and I
represent, um,
district 16, which is
the other side of the university. We're
on, we're on the west side and
I represent the
Southeast,
um,
Southeaster, southeast
of the university and northeast of the
university. Good to be
here.
>> Representative.
>> Ok,
>> you have a new
knee
>> chasey. I have been at
Corrections and Justice.
Can you interview me earlier this
week and that I was able to
join you? My
include the
national camp of you.
And
>> is there anybody else? I
think, I think everybody
else has introduced themselves at
earlier meetings.
Um, and before we go
to today, to this morning's
panel, we have one
little bit of business that we can now
take care of
since we have a quorum,
an official legal quorum.
Did you fly in again
today?
Oh, my
gosh.
Representative Jones
has been commuting from
Demming.
Well,
congratulations.
Thank you.
The,
the business is
our, our minutes
and they're in your packet
if, if, if we could
approve the minutes from the last
meeting. Now, the
one thing we don't have is
an approved work plan. As I
mentioned yesterday, the legislative
council won't
act on our proposed work
plan until their
meeting later this month
in about 10 days, I
think.
And, but
until then we
do have a set of minutes from the last
meeting if you want to look
those
over
and we'll accept
an amendment or a
motion to, to act
on them
mister chair.
So we have a motion to
approve the minutes from the
last meeting. And
a second. Is there any
discussion of those
minutes?
Any opposition to adopting
them? Seeing
none will consider the minutes
to have been adopted. And then we'll
move ahead with our first panel
this morning, which
is an update on
the topic that we've been
focusing on
each of the last two
days for those
of you who are in tear
weed.
We've had a number of
presentations that you can see
on the,
on our agenda. And
um yesterday, we heard from the
secretary
and so we're
eager to hear your take on
how things are going with the
department. Um
We have with us, Sarah
Crea, Doctor
George
Davis,
Betty Flashman, director
of Pegasus Legal
Services,
uh Gary Jospin from
the disability rights New
Mexico, who
made a brief
appearance on our Zoom
yesterday.
Thank you, Gary and
Teresa Yanan, the
executive director of the Native
American Disability Law
Center. So
let's, and we'll go
in whatever order Sarah are you,
are you the one coordinating this or
Gary is? OK, we'll,
we'll hand it over to you,
Gary.
>> Thank you. It's Mike. I, you
can hear me, Senator
Ortiz Pino, chair
and vice chair, Representative
Thompson and members of the committee.
We thank you for having the
opportunity to spend some time
with you today to talk
about the Kevin
case. Although I was
a little bit taken aback yesterday
when it was said that I did
when I didn't need to make any
comments that there were cheers
from the committee.
So uh
I'm ready to move on
and include those comments
today.
First of all, we're gonna break
up our presentation to
five sections.
Uh and each one of us is gonna
spend about 10 minutes on
each one of those sections. I'm gonna
provide an introduction, some
background upon Kevin
and where we have been and
where we're been
going, Betty
Fleischman will talk about the
importance of
CYFD and
HSD working
together to build a system
of trauma informed
care. Doctor
George Davis will talk about
the system's impact
on kids, really bringing
the kids into the room
today. With us
all theres,
Yanan will talk about
solutions and resources
that can be utilized
for reform. And
Sarah Creer will talk about
the need for the legislature
to support
the urgency of
progress
for these
reforms.
So Kevin often we talk
about is it's groundbreaking.
Well, why is it groundbreaking?
The settlement is really the
first in the nation to
build a child welfare
system that is based upon the
principle of
understanding,
responding to the
impact of trauma
experienced by Children
in foster care.
This state of the art system
of care will be fully
integrated with the Medicaid
system, mental
health and behavioral screening
and service delivery.
Every child entering
the foster care system is
highly likely to have
experienced multiple
forms of trauma
prior to be
entrusted into the
state's care.
When we reached a settlement in
Kevin S, we were really
encouraged by the state's
willingness to commit to
fixing what we all know
has been a broken
system of
serving Children and families that
are caught up in the dependency
system in New Mexico.
And together after very
productive mediation,
we were able to come up with really
a blueprint for
change.
And the Kevin settlement is
really that blueprint
for change and
reform
and
officials signed on to a
Secretary Blalock,
Governor Grisham
Secretary Stra
and all their councils signed
on to this, that this
and said this is perfectly
aligned to what we want
to see as a vision
for New Mexico.
And so the importance
of this settlement
agreement as a
blueprint as
it has been referenced is to help
build this system of
care.
So I wanna reinforce
four basic ideas
of that settlement
agreement.
One is identifying
trauma and needs of Children
entering custody and building
a sys, a trauma
responsive system of
care which
incorporates
instead of why are you doing
this? What happened
to you and how can we
help you
development at least restrictive
home and community-based
placements. Third,
building a strong behavioral
health services
network and
four address the unique
needs of native Children in
foster care. It
will ensure that native Children
have access to their tribes
and cultural practices.
It also recognize the
protections of Iqua
so that the Children are placed
appropriately with their families
and within their
communities.
So this isn't just a
Kevin isn't
just a
CYFD
venture and settlement.
It's CYFD and
HSD.
That is where the commitments
have to be fulfilled.
This provided solutions
and steps to achieve and
reform we
during the course of this settlement,
the last four years, we've adjusted
timelines due to
COVID. We've,
we've adopted
mouss with the state
that they were in agreement agreement with.
We've adopted a corrective
action plan on
matters that needed
urgent attention.
So this requires
collaboration between
Cyfd and
HSD.
Why? Because
HSD is the
essential provide
is essential to providing
a range of community-based
services to
Medicaid.
And I'm gonna pause for a second
to reference
the importance of
that because
we are now entered
into gonna be
entering in new contracts with
the managed care
organizations.
You heard last year from
Governor Grisham when
she announced who was gonna
receive these contracts
that New Mexicans are not
receiving $8
billion is spent with
the managed care organizations
and New Mexicans are not
getting services they
deserve.
So why is that?
Why are not the contract
provisions being
utilized and
enforced?
It lies at the feet of
HSD which
is now gonna become the health
care authority. So
when the Annie Casey Foundation
talks about doing things that
are preventive or
upstream,
that means are
the managed care organizations
really making
services available
to families and ki
kids before
they come into custody before
they're part of Kevin Ss.
And that's where there has to be
held accountability
and to be Frank HSD
has not had the appetite
to hold them accountable
to the point. It's almost
indifference. It's,
it's as if kids and
families are dependent,
neglected because they're counting
on the health care authority
to enforce those contracts.
And I've looked at those contracts.
They have great provisions in
it, but they're meaningless unless
they're enforced. You
have now seen
a second secret
shopper, uh,
report from the
Legislative Finance Committee
may 1st, I urge
you to read it to talk
about really what is the
provider network out there
for people and
questions to be asked
of HC A to make
sure that managed care organizations
are providing a network
for.
So that
leads us to along
with statements that secretary
A Mijo has made recently about
holding them accountable,
that has to happen.
Now, Betty Fischman will talk
later about the movement
to a single managed care
organization for kids
in state
custody.
So as we, we talk
about
um
achieving reform, one
of the things that's
has prevented
or or been
an obstacle
is that this change
requires stable
and sustained
leadership
that has been a problem,
reorganization
change in leadership.
Uh The most
recent
um stepping
down to sec of,
of Barbara V Hill,
the governor announced that she
would conduct a national
search for the next cabinet
secretary,
recognizing that this
person must have experienced
and successfully
pioneering major
systemic
reforms.
After that search
was completed
secretary Casados
decided that she would
end up filling that
position.
So we have
struggled with. And as Senator
Ortiz Pino has, has
said it before
when he met with leadership
in January 2024
CYFD. Not
a single member on that
team was
there six months earlier
under a different
secretary.
You have, you have that
revolving door that makes
it difficult for sustained
progress with
it and
without that expertise,
reform and
sustainability makes it
difficult.
I would say to you though
where there has been some
stability and sustainment
has been with us.
We have, we've been
here since the beginning. The five
of us along with Terra Ford
of Public Council has roots
in New Mexico. We
have remained intact
and we are committed to the,
the Settlement Agreement
of building a foster
care, better sister
foster system of
care.
But fortunately
fortunately, what we have
is that we have the benefit
and expertise of the co
neutrals. The co
neutrals are nationally
recognized, experts in
child welfare and health
services reform.
Among them, they have
expertise both
in child welfare and
Medicaid system.
The result of a team of
top national
leaders that are here
with us to UN
who also know and
understand New Mexico
deeply. Their role
involves evaluating the
state's progress towards
targets in agreement and
making sure that everyone
has accurate data
and information about the
targets. Not only do
they have validated reports
and you have the most recent
one, but
they also assess what is happening
on the ground. They've come into
New Mexico several
times to,
to see what is actually
happening. And that
expertise is vital
to this. One of those cold
neutrals is Kevin
Ryan, you
heard from the Andy Casey
Foundation, the remarkable
turnaround in New Jersey.
Well, Kevin Ryan
spearheaded that beginning
in 2006
and helped change that
system of care and is now
here.
So
you have with you the annual
reports that are produced by,
by the code
neutrals and just briefly
summarizing
of the 42
targeted outcomes in
that settlement agreement.
42 of them, only
five of them had were
completed by the end
of the 22
annual report.
That's 12%
and four out of those five
targeted outcomes were si
simply developing
a plan or
policy.
Uh In February
2023
Governor Grisham expressed
dissatisfaction with
the performance of the department.
She just described as
dysfunctional. You've
received a letter in September
2023 of the Co
neutrals talking about
their visit and their
concerns about what's happening
on the ground. And
then in January 2024
the co neutral said
another letter that
to their
disappointment, there's been no
progress and things,
things have gotten
worse.
So
we still support
the settlement agreement
as one of the best in the
country. It is vital. This
is what we need.
The settlement agreement isn't
the issue and you haven't heard
any officials say the settlement
agreement is a problem.
The problem is implementation,
the failure to implement.
And I would just like to close
with with one comment
and that reflects upon the
courage of the kids
because we can talk about targets
and settlement agreements and
everything else.
But I want to talk to you about J
TJ
T was taken into custody
at age five.
Gross emotional and
physical neglect
and sexual abuse.
He also had an underlying
medical condition secondary
to sexual abuse that was
untreated.
He was a victim
that was thrown into the system
dependent upon
our system
of care.
No foster parent
or treatment, foster
care uh placement
would care for him. He was
placed in an RT
C which
was closed because of
abuse in res of the
residents. He was
again abused in that
residential treatment
center. Still
no treatment. He
was then placed out of state
at a residential treatment
center. He was there for
two years, no
treatment while
there he needs
a neuropsych. He's
got a nine month waiting list
for a neuropsych.
An inadequate psychological
evaluate evaluation
has also prevented
him from not getting the services
he needs.
JT is now
14.
He's
14.
The system has
failed
and he's and
not only failed him, it's
harmed him.
So no matter
how serious his
conditions are, he
needs care,
he needs a home
to lay his head at
and a chance to live
right now. He's
surviving
So he must
be thinking, who's gonna fight
for me? What, what, what's
ahead for me?
And I would suggest that
JT and all others no
matter what wasn't done
before. And right
now, all these kids are under
our watch and there's
a, as I've said, a fierce
urgency of now for
these kids
because it's not too
late yet for
JT, but it is getting
late
and that
requires us to act
and to do it
promptly.
Um The
Kevin I'm closing, the Kevin
S team is invested
in the success of
Cyfd and HSD
to meet the needs of Children in
foster care.
And our comments are aimed
at helping the state
with real solutions
to stay on track, to meet
the goals of settlement,
the goals that we all have agreed
upon.
Now. I like to turn over to
Betty.
>> Just work. Can you hear me?
>> Ok? >> Thank you,
Mr Chair madam,
vice chair members of the committee.
Thank you so much
for inviting us to speak
with you today and some of
us we saw you last year.
So thank you for inviting
us again. Uh My name
is Betty Fleischman. I am
the executive Director of
Pegasus Legal Services for
Children. I am
also an attorney representing
Children in the foster
care. I am the
attorney of the first two
plaintiffs in
the Cine settlement
and Pegasus as an organization.
Currently, we are
representing Children
in 82 open
cases in Bernal Leo in
the child welfare
system. And I want
to begin by just saying that there
are some really good
amazing people working on
the ground, both in CYF
DH SD
and foster parents who
have opened their homes to these
Children. They're
excited, they're good, they're
committed, but
unfortunately, many of them are
leaving the departments or
giving up their foster care
license for a variety
of different reasons.
Um I'm gonna just echo what
Gary said about the two
co neutrals, Kevin Ryan
and Jude Smeltzer. You
do have the latest report
from them. They do an annual
report with
validated data
of how it's
going. And
um we're just fortunate they've been
in the state for four years
and I encourage everyone
to read the report and, and listen
to the recommendations. There is
a plan that will
work several
years ago. Uh They
emphasized that there must
be a solid
workforce and that is
key to any other reforms
happening. This
includes recruitment
and retention, both for
CYFD and
foster parents and there
is a workforce plan in place
approved by Kevin. It
just needs to be
implemented.
Um I was recently at a
national conference A B
A Children's Law
Center and a representative
from the Children's Bureau
described the Child welfare
system as the emergency
room responding
to urgent situations.
When Children are not
safe with an
implicit promise
that by removing them from their homes,
these Children will be safe.
And I agree with that assessment.
CIF is the
emergency room
cyd workers, the
investigators, they are
first responders,
they show up, they get calls
in the middle of the night.
Um And like any other
emergency service, you
cannot pause it
or stop it while
you're looking at how
to structure it. You got to
keep the doors open.
And sadly, because our
caseworkers, these first
responders are not
supported. Um
Oftentime removing Children
does not create more safety
for them and in fact, sometimes
creates unnecessary
trauma.
Um The inability
of CYD to hire and
retrain staff has significant
impact on our
Children. And I want to share
with you one
snapshot of what it looks like
for those of us that are in the ground
representing the Children
going to children's court
every day.
There were collateral
consequences
as a result of the
staff
vacancies.
Specifically,
court proceedings are delayed
because there's no workers that show
up at court. You can't have a hearing
if the worker who is a
legal guardian of
this child
isn't there.
Um The
delays in this process
create then it creates delays
in permanency for the Children
and it's harmful while these Children
linger in cares often
for years
unnecessarily
every day in Bernal Leo Children's
Court. The hear we have
hearings that are continued.
I actually had two hearings this
week I showed up
and they were continued because no one
from CFD was available
to show up. Let
me give you one example. I have
one of my clients who is
2.5 years old.
She has been in state
custody for two
years. And what is
supposed to happen by law
is when
um a child's taken into
custody within
60 days, there needs to be an
adjudication for
this child. We have been
trying to adjudicate her for
two years and every court
hearing gets continued
because the worker who is working
there has since left
sometimes the morning of
court and just walked off the
job. There's no one
to, to speak
to the court, there's no one to represent
the child.
Um
So we either end up with a
substitute CWD
worker or
a new phenomenon.
Nobody at all. And that has happened
several times. Like I said twice
to me this
week by
now, this young child who's
2.5 should have a permanency
plan. She should either be going
back with her parents
or being set up
for adoption or guardianship.
Instead she is lingering
in foster care because the legal
process which is put
in place to protect these
Children from unsafe
situations cannot fulfill
its obligation because
there's no CFD
worker to show up for the court
hearing. And this particular
child was in fact
taken into custody
because of serious domestic violence
in her home.
Um So in addition
to uh slowing down the legal
process, this
um this
is costing you the
state an enormous amount of
money because these
cases literally take
about twice as long as they used
to, which means
that the state
is paying for the CYD
attorney, the CYD
workers paying for
a guardian at Lytham, paying
for attorneys for each
parent and sometimes other
interveners. So that's an enormous
amount of really
wasted resources
because these cases continue
for like two or three years longer
than they need to
because because there's nobody
there to show up.
Um
And then the final kind of collateral
damage around this is that
because it's
the,
um because
so many hearings get
postponed and because there's
such a change in
turnovers, the
gu lines or youth attorneys
are literally doing double
work. We're doing our jobs
and cc you know,
the worker's job.
And as a result of the, that I know
of at least five really excellent
attorneys who are stepping back and
refusing, giving, turning
in their contracts. I'm not going to do this
work. So just
another side effect is we're
losing, we meaning the system
which I'm part of are
losing some phenomenal attorneys
because it's just such a
frustrating uh, work
environment and it is a specialty.
A number of us myself included
are certified child
welfare
attorneys. It's a
specialized area, law and
we're just, that's
just one of the, another of the side
effect that's happening.
And I, you know, with the CYD
workers, the ones I've had
some great workers
and, um,
usually when they leave I ask them
why and
one of the main answers to get
back is they're so frustrated because
they can't do their job
because they'll do an assessment
for the child. A
absolutely an appropriate
assessment, know what the kid
needs and go to set them up and
services don't exist
and it just feels like
they're not able to
do what they came to do. And
that's, that's one of the main reasons
for them quitting.
Um
And that's really the
services side is a lack
of mental health and which you guys
all know of this. But, you
know, is a lack of mental health and
behavioral self services. And that
is the responsibility
of the human services
department. Soon to become the health
care authority. They
are co-defendant and Kevin
specifically for that
reason because that
partnership must happen and
it's their
obligation
to create these services,
appropriate services for
what these young people
need. Um
Both CYFD and
health and human
services has
stated that they're moving to an
MC O that is
a single MC
O which is
set up specifically
for Children in state
custody because
they claim that MC OS will be
able to focus on developing
services that they
need. And while this may
solve some problems,
it like making
it easier for the MC to
focus on trauma
treatment, it
may cause other problems
like creating a perverse
incentive for Children
to be in custody just to
get to receive the
services.
Um And we, we urge you
just to keep an eye on that as
this goes into place
and make sure that the problems and
demands and the services follow
the family and not the
custody. And
I actually saw this happen years
ago in my former life, I actually
was a therapist in rent
treatment programs. And
uh it's back in the nineties
and it was when I know
I'm dating myself totally.
But um
it's when the Behavioral
Health Services, at least the States
I was in which is the Arizona and
California were shrinking.
But at the same time, there was a
real renewed interest
in providing treatment to those who are
in jails and prison because
so many people ended up
there and the system got
so skewed, we actually knew
people who would consciously get
arrested because getting
in jail was the only way they could get their
treatment. So
we're hoping this isn't what happens
with this new system.
Um But it has the potential
to do that.
So, you know, when CFD
as an agent of the state
takes these Children into
custody, there is a
promise that
these Children will be safe
and that their lives will be
better with a
promise to work towards
reunification
in a timely manner.
At this point,
that promise has been broken.
We have kids sleeping in
offices, we have kids
lingering foster care
literally for years.
That is not necessary.
So thank
you for your interest in these
issues. I know you've had three
days of listening to everyone's
opinion on this.
Um And thank you for your interest
in the Children of New Mexico.
From our perspective, this
is a public health crisis,
it is a real crisis
and we hope you guys will continue
to have these
hearings
um and
hold the state agencies
accountable.
And all we're asking is to
fulfill the promises
that they made. Kevin
S was not a court order,
it was the consent degree.
Everyone agreed and
we hope
these promises can be kept. Thank
you so much for
listening and for
your interest in
this.
>> Is this on? Oh, yeah,
it is. Wow,
it's
powerful.
Um Good morning uh
Chairman Ortis
Pino, vice chair
Thompson members of the
committee. My name is George
Davis. I'm a child
psychiatrist. Uh
I've been on faculty
at UN M School of Medicine
and uh
spent three decades
working for and with
CYFD
and I'm currently working as a
consultant for the uh
Kevin
plaintiffs.
I want to talk briefly
about uh
foster care
from the child's perspective.
When a child enters state
custody,
you have to forgive me. I'm a little
congested but it's nothing you're
gonna get. It's not
COVID and it's, it's not
infectious. So
doctors don't know what it
is when a
child understate custody, it's
almost always because the parents
have in some sense for some reason
failed to
complete their parenting
obligation. So when
a child comes into
state,
if you could just bend that
mic, so that it's right, pointing
at your mouth,
you, I can move it a bit
too, that's
better.
Um or also can
set up, there's three things I could
do. Um So when a
child comes into state protective
custody, the state by
default becomes a
surrogate parent
with all the responsibilities
that entails
in that sense, the state agency,
including the caseworker, the
foster family,
and all the workers that
have direct contact with
that child becomes a child's
lifeline.
I don't mean to
exaggerate the state's
responsibility. I'm just stating
what we all know it is
as, as parents and
caretakers
ourselves,
probably most in this
room, our
parents or have been
caretakers or have been
parents or
grandparents. So
we all know
that we
will go to incredible lengths
to take care of the Children
in our custody.
For example, if a child
has learning
disabilities,
um the principal
of the school soon knows your
name
or somebody's name in the
family. If a child
has conditions that can't be
treated
within New Mexico because of
lack of specialists,
then you're on the road to
Denver or Houston
or Phoenix or
wherever it
is.
Children in protective custody
are completely
dependent
upon the state
and upon the worker
to provide that
same kind of
oversight
clearly,
even though the state agency
is a legal guardian. However,
that day to day supervision,
that day to day sort of
interaction with that child and
identification of the child's
behavior problems and medical
conditions that day to day
supervision falls to a
foster parent really
cannot be done by
a
caseworker who
has multiple cases
and not only that it
can't be done at a distance, it
has to be done on site
with eyes on the same
way that we take care of our own
Children.
All the child development
research of the past 50
years concerns over
confirms over and
over that a
relationship with a caretaker
is the primary ingredient
for normal development.
It's not a nice thing.
Child development normally
does not happen without
a strong permanent
uh caretaker and a
relationship with that
caretaker.
By almost any measure,
CYFD is grossly
short of adequate foster
parents. I don't
know how to reconcile the
secretary's assurance that they're
making great strides in
recruiting foster families.
When after four years,
we see no figures
to indicate that
we see also no
systematic plan
for how to carry out that
recruitment or that
retention.
Despite the fact
that that was
agreed to a year
ago in the last corrective
action plan, there's been
no progress on that
plan.
The lack of foster family
recruitment is only one of the
several reasons why
the plaintiffs are taking both CYFD
and HSD to
arbitration.
I would like to be reassuring.
Uh And it would be nice to be
reassuring that hospitals,
residential treatment centers
and group homes
collectively known as
congregate care
could provide adequate
long-term support for a child.
But that just isn't the case.
Residential treatment has a
beneficial place in the
spectrum and it's
essential to have it.
Um But it's used for
emergency care. It's
used for
stabilization. It's
used for weeks
or at the most a month,
but it's not a place that you can
use for many months at a time.
It's not a place for years.
It's not a place to grow
up.
The reason why the Kevin S agreement
didn't even include congregate
care in the recommended spectrum
of care is because
it's so easy. And in the
past has been so
common to
just park a child in a
residential treatment center,
either in state or out of state
and, and leave them
sometimes for years.
We'll talk about that. I think that's
less common now.
And under
Secretary V Hill, there was a lot of
progress made and the Children that
were in out of state
rtc's,
but they're still there,
there are Children still
there and it's still a practice
that we resort to
moreover, we resort to
residential care in
state
CYFD did. Their credit.
Has closed several of
the largest rtc's in New
Mexico and they closed
them for abusive conditions.
That includes places like
Desert Hills,
that includes places like
youth health associates
that includes Burnley
Academy
collectively had,
you know, hundreds of Children in
those. It's
a fiction that any state
facility, any
out of state facility
is any better than the
facilities in the
state.
It's a compromised modality.
That's the only way to put it. Residential
care is not a good
place to raise a kid.
It's great for an emergency and
it's for for the
actual conditions
that promote normal
development
abuse, neglect,
parental separation that is
unaddressed and
untreated later
causes problems with. And this
is a long list.
The long-term
consequences of,
of early abuse
and act early
abuse and neglect
include impulse
control, poor judgment
learning problems above
and beyond,
above and beyond. Simple
learning disabilities,
anxiety,
intense reactivity,
depression, impaired
social and interpersonal
capacity and skills, poor
problem-solving
and a marked and this is
essential and a
marked
propensity to substance
abuse. When we looked
at the kids in who
were incarcerated, New
Mexico and Juvenile justice,
the study that we did
with
Sarah Stedman
from the law school
and Andy, she
together we looked at all those
kids, not only
did they have,
I think it's, I
think the average adverse
childhood experience count
was eight,
among those kids,
almost 95%
of those Children
had,
had experienced
early abuse and neglect.
In 60
2% of
the males and almost
80% of females
had had contact with
Cyfd Child Protective
Services. I don't mean to say
that's the course it's going to take,
but that's the kind of thing that
fuels that
kind of
outcome
just to give one painful
example from our own plaintiffs,
one of the named plaintiffs of
the original Kevin Ss lawsuit
was taken into custody at age
four, who was
sent to several foster families
as well as treatment, foster care.
Over the next several
years, the news
returned to his mother for
another couple years at which
time he again required custody
because she wasn't able to take care of
him.
After reassuming custody,
Cyfd sent him to an
out of state RTC in Texas
for 2.5 years.
When he returned to New Mexico
as an early tang.
He was again
returned for a third time to
his mother's custody
and she was not able to manage
him at home and she
still also suffered from those
addictions.
Then he was sent to a group home
in Colorado where he was
eventually removed due
to repeated restraints,
fights and excessive
medications.
When he was back in New Mexico,
cy fa sent him
to a facility in
Utah that was
owned by the same company
as a facility that had been
closed in New Mexico.
He stayed there for two more
years and then he
returned to New Mexico because
they claimed he was not making
progress.
He was then sent to an RT
C in Indiana.
Again, owned by one of the
same companies have been closed into
Mexico. He stayed there for a
year. He returned to New Mexico
to a specialized group home
for developmentally delayed
individuals. And now he's in
the adult criminal justice
system.
Only part of this scenario
obviously happened in the current
administration, part of it
did.
But the shortage of
foster families
and the lack of medical
services as provided by
Medicaid means
that we are creating
those Children actively
more cases like this.
These kids are in the pipeline.
We know who they are,
we serve them, we see
them as patients or we see them
as clients.
I relate this to for a reason
not just to appall and to
depress you, but primarily
to tell you that it didn't have to take
this course. There are
multiple significant
intervention points all along the
way the mother
could have potentially been
provided in-home
services to help him
stay with his primary caretaker.
I don't know or wasn't there.
I don't know if that was possible or not,
but I do know she was not physically
or deliberately
abusive. She wasn't malicious.
She simply had an
addiction.
The child could have been diagnosed
initially with intellectual,
with his intellectual
disability, which was pretty
clear.
And yet
for the first five
years, he probably never saw a
provider that was able to
note that or
diagnose that.
And he evidently, and he,
even until the age of
18, he didn't receive any
kind of services
for that intellectual
disability.
It's more than clear that CW.
And,
well, just to make a
comment, if you total
up all of his, um,
residential care, it's
5.5 years in residential
care, almost all of it
out of state, except for the failed
time that he spent at youth health
associates here in, in
the, in this uh in this
state,
22 primary
ways that foster
Children are most likely to be re
traumatized in the current
child welfare system is
first by the sheer lack of
adequate foster families,
especially ones with the
experience and the capacity
and the durability to manage Children
with medical, emotional
and behavioral problems.
There are some truly heroic
foster families. You heard about
some of them, I think
yesterday.
Um But many of those
have five or more Children.
That's why we call them heroic, I
suppose five
or more Children already and
are still, they're still
counting those beds in
their homes as part of their
total
count.
Totally lost my way. I got
so
excited.
The second
way
the Children are most likely to be re
traumatized in New Mexico
is by the marked lack of
medical psychiatric and
psychological services,
especially those that are willing
to take Medicaid payment.
As we've seen in other
reports, there's
25% of providers
in the state that will not
take uh uh
payment
for uh payment
by Medicaid.
There always seems to be a
significant discrepancy
between the official Behavioral
health network adequacy
that's reported by the
MCS and the actual
situation in the communities across
the state.
When I search for behavioral
health Services
for Children myself, such as
something like
like neuropsychological
assessments, I
almost always have difficulty
finding them. And then when I
do the last one I made
was over a year out. The
appointment was a year out.
That's not, it's not
acceptable. It just doesn't
work.
The secret chopper report
generated by the LFC in
December of
2022
found that they were able to make a
phone report for medical
or behavioral health services with
Medicaid clinicians only
13% of the
time.
This should be a caution to all
of us to look at the
actual situation on the
ground instead of the numbers
that are provided.
The Meyers and Stoffer report
that HSD itself
commissioned and
which came out in July of
2022
gave an in-depth assessment
of why the Medicaid provider
work. Uh Medicaid
Provider network is
so compromised
and recommended steps to
improve it. Their report
is Candid, it's Myers
and Stoffer. It's Candid thorough
and worth reading for anyone who's
concerned about Medicaid.
Two of their recommendations
included
one, supervise the
MCO S, simply
hold them to their contractual
obligations
and to collaborate with
providers and listen to their
complaints about managed care,
the obstacles to
credentialing the
barriers to contracting,
the impediments to carrying
out care and the
obstacles to getting paid
for the work that they've already
done.
Thank
you.
Yeah.
>> Good morning, Chairman
Ortiz Pino, vice chair
Thompson and members of the committee.
Thank you so much for having us
here. My name is
Teres Yanan and I'm
the director and an attorney
with the Native American
Disability Law Center
for over 10 years.
We have represented
Native American Children in state
custody in San Juan
and mckinley counties.
We were a plaintiff in
the Kevin S lawsuit
after years of trying to
obtain services for our
clients that did not
exist. Our
efforts were to keep
Children connected
with their families, their communities
and their cultures and
Cyfd and HSD
were unable to provide
the supports and services that these
families so desperately
needed. We were
part of the final settlement
agreement negotiations
and we've been part of the team
to monitor the implementation
of that settlement.
The final settlement agreement
in Kevin S
is the
road to
fixing this
system. It
is the path
to follow.
It is one of the best
settlements in the country.
It's one of the only settlements that
includes or references the
needs of Native American
Children and it
is the way forward.
The problem is the lack
of implementation
and what it shows
is that when it is
implemented, it
works. The
final settlement agreement
required one
individual to
be a representative
and a liaison with
the state's tribes in
Pueblos that resulted
in the Office of Tribal
Affairs. That
office has
enabled native
Children to have
access to their
communities,
excuse me, and
ceremonies and
traditions and their
culture. That's
the result of the Kevin S
lawsuit.
When it is
implemented, it works.
The final settlement agreement
endorsed and required the
state to work on a State
Indian Child Welfare Act
and it resulted in the
passage of the Indian
Family Preservation
Act
when Secretary V
Hill focused on,
on moving Children back
from out of state placements,
those numbers
drastically
significantly decreased.
That was a requirement of the
settlement
agreement.
There is a plan in
that agreement that if
it is implemented can
have a
significant and positive
impact on the services for
the Children that we're all concerned
about here
in June. Of last
year, we negotiated
with the state for a corrective
action plan. Part
of that corrective action plan
required pilot projects
in Doanna and
San Juan counties.
The goal of those pilots
was to
focus at the community
level, what was needed
at the community level
and how could the community
have input, get
the conversation out of
Santa Fe, get it
from statewide and
make it more manageable by
bringing it back to the
community.
Those pilots had
community buy-in.
I was part of the San
Juan pilot, Gary,
how Sepian was part of
the Dona Ana
pilot. There were
clear recommendations that were
made as a result of
nine months of
meetings.
They were comprised of not
only community
representatives, service
providers, foster
parents, but
also local
CYFD and HSD
representatives.
When those recommendations
were presented,
they were
concrete,
they were specific,
I can tell you in San Juan
County, the CYFD
staff wanted to know who
their supervisor
was.
They wanted training that
exi that was beyond a
lecture format.
That was hands-on.
How do you deescalated
a child who's in
crisis?
How can I practice
that so that it's a
muscle memory and I know what
to do, what to say.
That's what the Cyfd staff
wanted. They were very
specific.
There was the, there was
a recommendation that they
develop a mentoring program
for foster parents
so that foster parents could
talk with somebody to help them
work through a hard
situation.
There were recommendations
that the
staffing
was a primary
issue in both
counties.
There's an issue when
Cyfd
has a 20%
vacancy rate so that they can
stay within their
budget.
They need to fill the positions,
they need the people on the
ground who do the
work.
And as Betty said, there
are good people on the ground
doing this work.
I don't know how they stay,
but they
are, but they need
to be supported. The
foster parents need to be
supported. They need to be listened
to one foster
parent who wanted to participate
in the San Juan pilot,
didn't um get notice
of the pilot because her
email had, that had
changed years before,
hadn't been updated.
So it's communication within
the system, but it's also communication
in support of the foster parents
that is so
necessary.
Under the cap,
cyfd agreed
to implement the pilot
recommendations unless they were
unreasonable or
uno
impossible.
I think uh
Secretary Casados
referred to talking with
stakeholders.
If she was referring to the
pilots,
we were a lot more than
stakeholders.
She agreed
to implement the
po the recommendations that were
made and again, not
rocket science,
not impossible.
They just need to be done. The
people need to be listened
to
Cyfd, met
with the Dona Ana
um pilot
team
and Mr A
Sepian can speak to this. He was
there from what I understand
they were told the recommendations couldn't
be implemented because of a lack of
funding.
I believe Senator you said
earlier in one in
either yesterday or
Wednesday funding
isn't the issue
here.
There's funding is not the
problem, it's
the implementation. That's the
problem.
On Wednesday evening,
Secretary Casados
and two of her
deputies met with the San Juan
pilot.
Um The recommendations
were received
graciously, she
agreed to come back to San Juan
County at 36 and
12 months to report
back on the
recommendations.
I was cautiously
optimistic.
I don't know if I'm a cynical
idealist or an idealistic
cynic, but I walked out
cautiously optimistic
that the recommendations that were
made were going to be
implemented
until she referred to
the meeting
as a meeting with
stakeholders.
Because the corrective action
plan required more
than just listening.
And it all goes back to the settlement
agreement,
HSD and
CYF D's budget.
In our opinion,
needs to focus on
the settlement agreement
deliverables.
Their budget needs to be
tied to what they committed
to do,
not what they're planning on
doing tomorrow,
not what they're planning on
doing in six months.
What did they agree to do
four years ago?
And is the budget
designed to
implement those
agreements? That's our
recommendation.
We don't make that decision, we know
that, but that's our
recommendation,
the resources
to hire staff,
recruit, recruit and retain
foster parents or otherwise
address these system. Wide
issues are all
tied to the
budget
and they need to be
held
accountable.
Both CYFD
and HSD
need to be asked,
what have you done
with the money we've given
you. I've been
listening in for most of the
last two days
and I
think that a lot of those
questions are being asked by
this committee and I appreciate
it. I think
we're all on the same page
here
as Mr Hapon
mentioned, the co neutrals
are also crucial
here. They have
the expertise. New
Mexico does not need to re
invent the wheel. The
final settlement agreement
actually very carefully
tracks a lot of what
you've been hearing over the last
couple of days. The
Annie Casey
um presentation
referenced New Jersey as
Mr Hussein referenced
and Kevin Ryan was key in
that and so was Judy Meltzer,
the other co neutral.
These people know what they're doing
and we are lucky to have their level
of expertise
and their input and
their knowledge of the
state. They
don't, they don't
stay out of New
Mexico and just
read reports. They come
here and they make those
reports
they need to be listened
to because they know
what's happening in the state.
The report that you all
have is validated
data, it's not
broad, we're
developing this,
it is what is happening
here in the state and it
can be relied
upon.
We really recommend to
this committee that you
ask what the co
neutrals have recommended,
what has happened based on those
recommendations and what hasn't
happened based on those
recommendations
because they have tried to meet
with every secretary that's been
in charge of this department
and their recommendations are not
being followed.
Finally, I'd like to
speak briefly about
the resources provided to New
Mexico's tribes. And
Pueblos,
the tribes and
Pueblos were
not part of the case
and they were not part of the final
settlement agreement.
Everyone in this room
including me repre
appreciates and respects
their sovereignty
and their ability to
make choices for their
communities.
But the Kevin suit
was unique
in all of the
similar cases around the country
because it included that reference
to Native American
Children.
The tribes and Pueblos play
an important role in addressing
and meeting the needs of the, of the
Native American Children and
families involved in this
system.
Well, neither the state nor the
plaintiffs can bind or
obligate the tribes and Pueblos
to commit to any activity.
And we fully recognize
that the
final settlement agreement and
the corrective action plan
contemplate that the state
will make resources available
to the tribes in
Pueblos
right now. Tribes and Pueblos
are fulfilling roles that
are invaluable to meeting
the needs of their
families,
but they're doing it using their
own resources. In many
cases, they're doing the state's
jobs.
The Navajo equal workers
are doing home
studies
and the state is not
covering the cost, the
state in this in the
cap agreed to provide
resources to tribes and
Pueblos and those
resources are crucial
to meeting the needs of these Children
and their
families.
As I said, we really encourage
you to look closely at the final
settlement agreement and help
us ensure that it's implemented.
It's not a consent
decree, as was said earlier,
they make commitments and they're not
fulfilling
them.
We also encourage you to talk
with the co neutrals.
They know what is
happening in the state and
they have really solid
recommendations on how to address
the needs. Thank
you so much for your
time.
>> I'll be brief so we can get
to questions. I know that the
committee has a lot of
insights and questions for
us and we have been diligently
listening to the previous um
testimony. So please
do um feel
free to, to refer to what
you've heard before and ask us specific
questions um related to
what's been presented before.
My name is Sarah Crea.
I'm an attorney. I'm
represented Children in foster
care since 2001.
I was co counsel in the Kevin
S lawsuit. I'm a
member of the, the
plaintiff's implementation
team and I thank
you, Senator
and Chair Ortiz
Pino and Vice
Chair MS Thompson and members of
the committee for listening to me today
and, and really bringing attention
to this
critical topic.
What we heard yesterday
from the secretary of CYFD
was not a description of
reforms
made by a proud child
serving agency. What we heard
was a defense.
We heard about ideas and
conversations and if
and things we're looking at but not
results. We
heard the secretary say yes, I
promised to end the practice
of keeping Children overnight
on the floor of our office
a year ago when I
took this job, but
we, we've still got dozens and
dozens of Children in offices
throughout the
state.
I know of a child who was sent
back to the home where he was
sexually abused
over Memorial Day weekend
because it was better than
keeping that child in the
office here
in Bernalillo County. That was the
decision made by the
agency that we
are all asking
to do better.
What we heard yesterday was a
101 foundation
of child welfare. When
we deserve to hear a
crisis plan,
this state is in
crisis. We
are competing every year
for 50th with states like
Mississippi on
all indicators of childhood
success.
The this plaintiff's implementation
team just sitting at this table.
It's only part of our team has over
100 years of child
welfare experience. We have not
been engaged by this
agency
or or asked
about how to implement the
plan. The
Kevin S agreement was
reached with the
agency and with
HSD and we
hired these team of experts
when we say the co
neutrals have validated
Cyf D's data, what that
means. And I really want
everyone to hear this is
they have a team
of it experts
working with the IT
folks at CYFD
to make sure the data is
real. It's
not falsified,
it is accurate
and it's reliable,
that takes an enormous
amount of energy and time. And
we are all paying for it.
The we are, the taxpayers
are paying for this expertise.
We need to rely
on it every
year. They issue a report
for you.
It is based on the validated
data. They also have
traveled the state to
speak
with
staff to speak with
providers. This is
now this is above and beyond the
pilots that Gary
and theres also conducted
to have individualized
recommendations in the
community. We
call on you to read
each document produced by these
experts. They were created for
you. When we hear, when we
hear things like the
cap the corrective
action plan that
refers to a document you should
review it is it is
reduced goals because
the agency couldn't
get the foundation, get
off the baseline
of the agreement
because the final settlement agreement
is a multiyear
foundation to
build. We don't just
start from the top. We build a
foundation, we
negotiated with this
agency and with Secretary V
Hill and others,
a reduction of that.
Ok? You can't do that. We'll
reduce it to this corrective action
plan. We'll make it digestible
for you. They ignored
it. None
of it has been
accomplished.
We encourage you to
hold this agency accountable
to what it has already
promised. We hold,
we encourage you to ask the
secretary when she comes before you,
why aren't you following
Kevin us?
This is the plan. We don't
need new ideas. We don't need
an expert from outside. We
have hired them. They've been on
the payroll of this
state since March
of 2020.
When I hear the secretary
talking about
moving Children from the
office to congregate
care to the what used
to be the place where girls
leaving prison stepped
down into which I have visited
not this most recent
iteration but
in December of
2022.
And I tell you, it
is the most demoralizing
place for a child
to be, it might be
better than the floor of the office.
It is not a home,
it is not a foster parent,
it is not a person
who says who shows you that they
love you and they
care for you. It is demoralizing.
My clients have been
in these placements
and I want to very briefly
talk to you about my 17
year old client who we while
16 was
forced to live in
the office here in Bernalillo
County
last year
from August 29th through
October. Sorry,
on the floor from August
29th, 2023 through
October 1st.
During this office, state
placement, a myriad
of her rights were
violated.
She was served reheated
frozen food prepared
at the Bernal County Juvenile
delinquent Center and then
transported cold in
styrofoam. That's
what these Children are being fed
prison food.
When I raised that in
a um meeting
and I pointed out that the children's
mental health code clearly
says she is to
receive a nourishing well
balanced, varied and
appetizing diet to include
fresh fruits and vegetables.
The department supervising
children's court attorney
defended the practice claiming
that she and other children's court
attorneys had tried the food and they
thought it tasted good.
So in addition, insult
to injury to these kids,
the kind of denial we
heard yesterday
is being presented to me and
to my client's face. The
gaslighting that you
all experience
when you're you're hearing
that we've got it covered,
everything's fine that happens
to these kids.
And what also happens
is every single day
they are spending in the office.
They are asked, don't you have a
relative? Don't
you have a friend's parents
who will take you isn't
there anywhere you can
go.
That is so
painful for these
kids. How do you tell a
child?
You are garbage without
telling a child you're
garbage.
You remind them they have
nobody and that it is
their fault.
So they spent another night in the office
eating literally
reheated prison
food.
I provided fresh fruit
and other warm meals at my own
expense. And on one occasion, I
was barred from entering the office
space to deliver these
groceries in retaliation for
zealously advocating for my
client's
needs.
On September 17th,
a male CYFD security
officer. And this is, I believe a
weekend day in response to
my client's predictable,
upset and
outburst
told her what you need is a good
old fashioned ass
whooping.
The department didn't include this
in their permanency hearing
report
had a foster parent acted in
this manner. I think it would have made
the court report.
She was frequently told
she would not get outings outside
this office. Now, meanwhile, no
education provided no mental
health services provided and her
basic mental health
and physical health needs were not being
met, but they told
her you won't get to go out if
you don't go to school even though
she had documented anxiety
about school and was on an
IEP if you didn't
clean, clean the room,
what? There's no storage,
this is an office,
there's no dresser.
Um So again,
let's not focus
on, let's not allow this
agency to shift the burden
to the Children, to the
community. Um I
heard some things yesterday that was
pretty insulting. It's gonna
take, you know, um,
we're not allowed to take
Children into custody. That's law
enforcement. The, the burden
shifting that we hear from
this leadership is the reason
we're here today begging
you to look
at the agreement to hold them
accountable to it. The
one that they and we paid
for
where you're here because you
care,
you're here because you have the power
to hold this state agency
accountable. And we
call on you to support any
bill that causes
Sunshine on this
agency and its
practices,
funding for staffing and
programs that are directly tied
to Kevin, a careful
review of each of the co
neutral reports which are on
our website, Kevin
settlement.com
and a full throttle engagement
of this plan for, for
reform. We
thank you for your attention to these
Children
and we now invite your
questions
back up
here.
>> No, let's go ahead with
questions.
>> Um So I
think I'm
assuming we'll, we'll have questions
from, we'll give everybody a chance to
ask a question and
you have, uh we
take the available time, we divide it
by 20 we have
14 seconds
each.
So make it quick. Uh
But
I think I said, Representative
Chasey had put her hand up long
ago. So we'll start with you.
Then we'll work toward
Representative Vincent
and then a back
around this way. We'll just
keep,
>> so
>> we're gonna stick with the three
minutes. But, but
it's,
>> it's, >> we're gonna
stick with three minutes and
please, that includes
questions and answers
and please don't just ignore
my timer. It hurts
my feelings.
>> I'm really sad because
I have a lot of questions, madam
chair, Mr
chairman and madam vice chair.
Um Let me just ask
if I can get a quick
question. I am a
little confused. I've never been
involved when there's a consent decree.
Can the parties?
I mean, I, I assume
you're adversarial
Cyfd and
the um the
Covin team,
can you have informal
conversations where
they consult you
about what to do?
>> Of course. And also I just want to
remind everyone it's not a consent
decree, it's an agree, it
is a, it's a
contract.
>> Ok. Thank you. That
answers. >> I'm sorry. Just one.
It would turn your mic
off if you're not
speaking.
>> That answers that
question.
I just let me ask one more
question about the Children in the
office because I know that
when Children
become 14,
they can consent to
where their placement
is. What
do you want cyfd
to do if the Children
refuse
alternative placements
to the
offices?
>> I'm so glad you asked that question
because in the young woman, I
described their daily
placement, staffing, what that
means is placement
workers in Burnley. This is for Burn
Leo County and it is the largest,
we have the largest volume of Children
in care in this county, over half
of all kids in custody are in
Burnley County.
So this system
is important to
watch. And what they do
is they call every
single foster parent, including
the ones who are full every single
day. I
have other clients who
have five,
the foster parent has five
Children, seven and under. She's
single. She's
called every single day. She
finally said yes to two teens
to get them out of the office. So that's
what happens.
Other thing is they call
when, when they come before you and
they go before the court in my case and
say you're Sarah's
client refused a placement.
I'm sorry, she
refused an
office, a couch
at the shelter
from 10 p.m. to
7 a.m. That is not a
placement.
She wanted the devil. She
knew these kids
also have massive
amounts of trauma.
They don't feel they
deserve much
as a result.
They don't like
conflict.
And so they
also don't want to get rejected.
So if this is gonna be a placement,
they know isn't gonna work. Maybe a
foster family that
doesn't really want teens,
they don't want to get kicked
out. They'd rather stay
with the devil that they know.
So what you need is
buy-in from
a loving adult to
walk them through their options.
That's what I try to provide.
I'm only a lawyer.
I'm not a counselor or social
worker, but I wind up having to
fulfill those roles to usher
my client through real
options.
>> Thank you.
Thank you madam chair. I'm
wondering if the consent
decree solution
has a component to prevent
ASIS trauma or prevent
removal.
>> Well, the short answer to that
is this
and again, it's not a consent
decree but, but the
agreement
does not have provisions
for avoiding.
It's basically concerned with
the Children who are already in
custody. There
is a lot of advice
coming from the co
neutrals and from you
heard it from an Casey
when they presented yesterday as
well, um about
how to prevent that. And,
and his point yesterday,
it is a very good question because
his point yesterday was
even though it functions
like uh an emergency
room, it
shouldn't, it should, there
should be so much
layers of treatment
and diversion ahead of
that, that it,
that it doesn't
need to function in that kind
of way. But no, in
this particular agreement,
there is
not
pre-emptive or
other
kinds of provisions to avoid
foster care.
>> Sure,
I
was
chairman uh Ortiz
Pino and, and Representative
Chasey. Um
The uh that's
why I alluded to about
upstream. There is an
opportunity for individuals
who have aces before they come
into custody.
Um We can
we, if we have the managed care
organizations, truly making
sure that these services are
available and providing care
for them, let's don't wait
until they come into the
system. And that's
the type of things that Andy Casey
was talking about. And so
that's outside of Kevin,
but we don't want Kevins
to be bigger.
>> I think you just add one thing briefly
about your question for
the foster care
for the older Children. 14 and
over we, we have had
conversations about developing
a track of foster
parents who specialize
in that group. Like
identifying, they won't
be asked, they won't be called every day
to take the five year old, the six
year old, but allow
foster parents who kind of
like teenagers
who may have a lot of
problems um and
have a special track
specifically for that.
And we think that's one solution that would
help really
>> quickly. New Day was
paid on a contract by CYFD
to do just that mentor
support and train
specialized foster
parent parent placement
for the hardest to place teens
that are in the office.
CYFD cut
that funding and ended
that program.
>> I, I just comment
if all
five panelists answer every
question, it's we're,
we're going to be here. We're not going
to get everybody's and,
and I, I
regret that we only scheduled
you for the, the amount of time
we did. We should have probably
thought this through more carefully.
We may have to ask you to come back
at some point to, to finish
it up next.
Representative Kates
followed by Representative Block
and Vincent.
>> Thank you, Chairman and thank you
very much presenters just
to tag on to the last
comment. We did hear testimony
this week
positive
testimony from individuals
that have been placed in New Day
and that that was one of the only
stable placements they had
had during their time
in foster care.
Today, I do not have any
questions for this panel. I have
questions for this committee
in our leadership.
So I
was discussed
yesterday that we had
a cabinet secretary
for three hours
who couldn't put on a piece
of paper the
names of the eight
staff members that she
brought in their contact,
much less how
things are structured or
what. And I am
begging this committee
to ask
that our MC
OSS provide reports
that are reflective of the
RFP
and that we
have um
CYFD coming in
with actual
list of the things
of the Kevin Ss
um accomplishments
and where is the data
and it is written
and when we make a
three hour block of time
and they show up with not a
single thing in writing,
you send them home
because I don't know how I can
make decisions without
any real data.
Even our, our
uh data we received
at the very beginning of this
week. No domestic
violence data.
And then I find out, oh, the
10 caseloads are wrong.
It was 10 caseloads that
month. If we do not
have good data or
any, I do not
understand as a legislator
how we can make sound
decisions. And I
feel this committee needs
to be able to show some of their
muscle and,
and, and, and I'm,
I'm, I
very much appreciate
you bringing here, but that's
how I could make
decisions is
having what the requirements
of the MCO are
and then how they have met
it and what are the
requirements of the Kevin
settlement and how
they have met them and they need
to be written so that this
committee can make
decisions on
bills. And you're absolutely right.
It is not funding. I
mean, as we stated
yesterday, they had
$10 million
reverted. This year, 33
reverted the year
before only
$100,000.
And what information
after three days do we
really have? Thank
you, Mr Chair.
>> Thank you, Representative Case
Representative block followed by
Representative
Vincent.
>> Thank you Mr Chairman. Thank you all for
being here today. I appreciate
all the the work that you
guys are doing to help
affirm these kids and ensure
that they get justice
and are not treated like
trash. That really is
terrible to hear that some
kids feel like
they are trash because this
system has made
them feel like that.
And so Mr Chairman and
presenters, I appreciate that
and I, I
hear this time and time again
that the state, no matter
what administration continues
to fail these kids.
And it, it just
for me from where
my perspective comes from, it's the
government's responsibility
and the government isn't doing the job,
the government isn't putting these kids
first. So what other
options are there to
ensure that this
contract
is being fulfilled, that
was promised by
these parties. And
so I know it's, it's a big
huge issue that we all have
to face together, Mr
or Mr Chairman and
everybody. But
I just have a couple questions
for you guys that I hope
that we can get in this
horrifically tiny
amount of time at three
minutes. But
number one, if I could
or if anyone could carry a
bill to fulfill the
promises in the contract of
Kevin S, what would
that bill do and
what would we need to ensure that
we fulfill it? And it's not just gonna be
money. And then
secondarily, I want
to know did
Cyfd
do a nationwide
search or a search at
all to find a
qualified individual
to put at the head of
CYFD or
was just someone from the
cabinet who was
pre vetted by the governor
just given a cushy
appointment, Mr
chair
presenters.
>> Ok.
Thank you, Representative Block.
Um
We, we really
do believe that the
settlement agreement is
the roadmap and the plan that
can be implemented.
Um If there's
legislation that can
be developed, I think all of us
would be very happy
to work with this committee, work with
any interested party to develop
that legislation uh
so that it
actually
effectuated what
was promised.
Um And I'll be
totally frank with you.
I'm up in San Juan mckinley
County. I don't know what's going on in Santa
Fe. Um
I don't
know what kind of
search
occurred.
Um
I
>> there was a Thank you,
Representative Lock, thank you
chair and madam vice
chair. There were attempts to
codify portions of Kevin
specifically keeping Children
out of the offices. Um
The first year after the agreement,
I believe that was the first pandemic
session in 2021.
The governor and her
cabinet secretaries vehemently
a Pope came to those committee hearings
to oppose that
legislation.
>> Thank you all. I appreciate it and
we have one second until my
timer went off. So I appreciate
you guys. Thanks Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and thank
you presenters.
It's painful to
watch
Cyfd
Flail.
And, you know, I,
I've committed to
go and, and walk
a mile in their shoes
because I want to see
firsthand and
this, Kevin s,
the other commitment I'm gonna make
is I'm gonna, I'm gonna study this
and I'm gonna read the whole thing
because in this
contract
with the contract that
you have
put on CYFD
and
the tasks that you've
given them, if you was to
give them a
grade,
what would it be
on how they're carrying this contract
out?
>> Mr Chair, vice chair
members of the committee.
Uh It certainly is an
incomplete
grade right now
and in some ways
it's an f on
some of the provisions that are,
that are directly
impacted upon kids,
that we've talked about this,
this the failure
to meet these targets,
they were sent out in a
sequence
so that if you did certain
implementations that you would get
some outcomes. So when you have
only like a 13%
outcome,
that means more than just
statistics. That means like
the JTS and the other
kids didn't get those
services
so
slow
ends up being an F
for many of these
kids right
now. There's been good things that
tree has talked about
under IQUA. There's been some
other good parts that
have been able to be
done.
But gosh, the court,
you know, I just tell you, we
have struggled
ourselves,
how we could be better
advocates to
somehow implement something that
we have no control
over
because those,
those kids keep us up at
night and I know keep up a lot of
people at night
and there's such an urgency
with it. So
I, I would just say that
that I can't,
I, I, we will
give some credit for
certain parts that have been
accomplished,
but it's hard to kind of give a
grade when you
know, there are so many kids
right now just sitting there
saying, am
I am I, what's
my life gonna be like?
You know the kid I talked
about JT nine
years, There's
no happy birthday
for him.
Um Thank
you.
>> Thank you Mr Chair and thank you for
that answer
and we're
not even going to give a grade.
So that an incomplete.
That's about, that's a zero.
That's about as we, as bad as
you can get. And I, I want
CYFD to know
that I, I think
that we're all on the same page. We
want them to be successful.
We don't want them to come here and
take a rear end to
and every time they show up
and, and being able
to celebrate your successes
is way better
than us sitting here talking about
their failures.
So,
um that's all
I have. Thank
you.
>> We'll go to, we'll go to
this side of the table,
Senator Lopez. We'll start with
you. Representative Garcia didn't,
did not have any
questions.
>> Uh Thank you, Mr Chair
and co-chair and, and
presenters.
Um We need
much more time so four minutes ain't
gonna, gonna hit it for me
either,
ok.
Three
um Mr
Chair, it just,
you know, there
are some successes
but during my tenure
I've seen the good, the
bad, the ugly and the, oh my
God. And we're still
there, Mr Chair.
Um, we've had, you know, kind
of ups and downs.
Um,
but Mr Chair over the years
too, I've tried to advocate for
Children who are sexually
abused and returned to their
father.
I've petitioned former Secretary,
Jacobson and others under
a previous governor,
didn't care, didn't
matter.
And these were saying reports,
right. I've
talked to Children who are in our juvenile
justice system and their
parents
currently
because there's no services for
parents and
families,
the Children who are in the
system. And I'm talking about
juvenile justice are a
product of what we have not
done.
And Mr Chair, it's not
hopeless. I
believe still that there's always
opportunities for us to
improve.
There's no way that I could experience
and understand what these Children
go through.
I have privilege
and a lot of these Children don't have
the privilege that those of us sitting
at these tables
have.
And if you go talk to their families
and try and understand where they're
coming from because there's no
resources, there's no help
for them. Even in the school
system, in the medical
system for mental health, it's,
it's the system's issue,
Mister
Chair,
I'm not
hopeless
and it's not a consent decree.
It's an agreement,
but the only way you can come to
it is by keeping people's
feet to the fire.
And I'll say it, as I said yesterday,
Mr Chair, my frustration
is, is that as a legislature, we
can have hearings and hearings and
hearings. But ultimately, it's the
executive
who makes that final
decision?
We put money in Mr
Chair, money isn't
spent. We take
the money back, we give it, we
try and hope that there's
some movement. But
again, Mr Chair, the
legislature doesn't have that
power. I think there's
things we could change it to in the
future. But at
this point, we're still
reliant on the executive and the
goodwill.
And I know Mr Chair that in this
committee, we are committed.
I'm committed as everybody else
in here to do this work and to
continuously be
advocates.
But we also rely on those
of you in the community who have
that other
um
lifeline for our
families and
sometimes it's going to court.
Thank you.
>> Thank you, Senator Senator
Pope,
Senator
Stannis.
>> Thank you Mr Chair and thank you
panel.
I try to think
in a, a
logical,
progressive
manner
and I think that there is so
much to
accomplish
that it can be
overwhelming.
So my
thought
is,
and you might not be able to answer
this today. But my thought
is if you were to
compartmentalize,
you are best to do this step
first, then this
step, then this step,
it would help
create a support system
for what has to be done.
And could any of
you. Just one or two of
you respond to that because of
time,
>> Senator Ortiz
Pino and committees,
I I think an example of
that was the pilots.
Uh the state
has struggled with this
overwhelming like
this is just too big for us.
We're, it's hard to get this
foundation some
footy. So the
pilot was recognized
as an opportunity to get
some footing there.
And you had investment
from people
collaborating,
speaking from the
community
upwork, right? Instead of
top down, you're hearing it
from communities
dedicated to
providing services.
And I was a part of the one in Dona
Ana and they get and
we provided that report
of their recommendations
that was
rejected
and they they
put down, it
wasn't criticism unless
you think recommendations that
you haven't thought of before
as being criticism.
These were specific
recommendations about
workforce recruiting
foster parents,
you know, those type
of specific ideas
be developing
wraparound services.
So there there were
some specific things because
at the end of the day, placements
are key besides
the workforce issue at
the end of the day that that
child needs a stable
home to be living to
where they can lay their head
down. So that means
continuing to recruit
heroic foster
parents. It
requires
the managed care organizations
that have treatment, foster care
placements available for
individuals. Because at the end of the day, you
need placements home,
like least restrictive
placements for these kids
with services too.
So that the foster parents
can feel supported in the
work they're doing.
Right. So,
so I I would,
I would re I refer
to the pilots as
that opportunity that was
provided that they
embraced as saying this
is a good idea,
but the result of it
is it, at
least in Dona Ana
it was rejected.
And you look at that
report, there's a lot
of time and effort and
heart put into
collaborating.
It wasn't, it wasn't
shaming people
workers or anything. It was
about what,
what this is, what
you can do for our community
here in Dona. Ana, you don't
have to do this statewide. Just do
that. There.
>> Could I just briefly add, we'll make
sure the, the pilot
reports from Dona Ana
and from the North are on our
website so that you all able
to our public documents. We'll
also make sure the corrective
action plan, which is
that the digestible, you can't
do the whole agreement. Let's
get you CYFD and HSD
to do these digestible corrective
action plan items. We'll make, we'll put
that on the website as
well.
>> Thank you for that question,
Senator. I, I just wanted to follow
up. I'm not sure I understand really the
status of the pilots
and
they were made part of the corrective
action plan.
You developed them in
San Juan and
Dona, but they're
not being implemented
in Dona or,
or what is the status of
the, uh, I guess I was
gonna ask for reports
from the pilots at a
later hearing this summer. But
if they're not, if they're being
rejected, is there,
are there pilots to report
about. >> Well,
I Senator
P or TZ Pino and
members of the committee
I was there, Donna Ana
presented the recomm
recomm recommendations.
We provided those
recommendations to you
detailed the
verbal response
from Secretary
Casados was
not accepting of any
of those provisions
uh that are recommendations
and they have not heard anything
further from the secretary
since then. So
that pilot themselves
are trying to figure out because
they wanted to develop some, one
of the recommendations is is they
want to keep working. They want
to have a, a group that's
continue to
engage
and follow up on these
recommendations as
a community with
the department,
but they have not yet.
So they, they are trying to
decide what is their,
what should they do next
now?
Because
their recommendations
were not
accepted.
And, and
I just, last week,
it was about, it's almost a
month ago that we
met uh
with the secretary
and, and the staff there.
So that's the
status in Dona
on
>> in San Juan. We are still
finalizing our report. We
were, we started a little bit
later for a variety of
reasons. And
so we just met Wednesday
with the secretary as
in the 5th
June fifth. Um
and uh the
recommendations were
generally well
accepted.
Um and
um the way
I understood the comments were
there, there was a commitment
from CYFD to implement
the recommendations and return
to the pilot and report
back to
um the
the people involved with the pilot
on the
implementation.
>> Thank you, Representative
uh Chavez.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you for
the um
presentation. Uh
We all know that CYFD
has been in chaos for a
very long time. And
I think that part of the
problem with
implementation is that
chaos, we
don't have consistent leadership
and we also don't have leadership
that has the expertise in
child welfare at the
state level to be able to
do that. My own personal opinion
is that we really need to think
about whether or
not this
agency should really be
under the governor
because as I've seen it,
every time there's a new governor,
there's new reorganization
and um things
just seem to go backwards. I
remember there was a time when the
department was doing
well, um after they got
out from under the consent decree
and then shortly thereafter,
things went downhill.
Um One of the concerns
that I have is with
regard to workforce,
um,
again, there's
a plan but it needs to be
implemented. And
one of the things that I,
I wonder
about is whether or not
the department and asking
for your opinion on this, whether or not the
department is really truly
focused on hiring
staff that
is,
that brings the skill
with them to be able to,
you know, work with these families and
kids, for
example, are they hiring
social workers?
My understanding is
that the
department is hiring
whoever
and in terms of
investigations, some of those
positions or many of those positions
have been filled by
retired police officers,
retired police officers
are not social workers. And I
don't think that they, they might
care about kids, but
do they really have the skills
necessary to, you know,
do investigations and really
assess the family situation?
Um And then the other thing
is you mentioned a number of
reports. Um,
if you all could let us, you
know, give us your, uh, website.
Um, I wanna, we'll look at
all the reports that you mentioned today.
I know that this is probably one of
them and then who,
who should we,
um,
you know, contact?
Um, there's five of
you. I don't want to contact
all five of you with the same question.
So, is there somebody in
particular that we should,
you know, that would serve as a point
person?
>> Thank you so much. Um,
chair madam,
vice chair and Representative
Chavez. So
just to answer the first question,
credentialing of
the staffing is very
important. I
don't disagree with
your assessment. Um,
and on top of that,
so what you heard yesterday was, we're
gonna try and fill these spots.
Well, we need to go
away. That's the basement.
Ok. That's showing up in
the basement. We need
to level up. We need
to have a,
um, trauma
informed training for
these staff members, mentorship
and support for
them. It is a I
hear time and time again, if
you would like to hear it yourself. I
ask you to, um, call
on probably
privately
current and former employees. This
is the one of the largest
employers of those
with social work licenses in the
state. No one wants to burn those
bridges, but it's a toxic
work environment. And for point
person, just very to wrap
up any one of us
can be a point person. We have
an email that takes it to the
entire team. So for
question, we're very great and bounded
around taking it to the entire
team and we're happy to engage with
any, any of
you.
Oh, sorry. Last but not least,
Kevin S
settlement.com
is the website where you
can find the um
documents and if you ever forget
that, just Google Kevin S
settlement and it will take you to
our website. Thank
you,
>> Representative
Ferrari. >> Thank you
Mr Chair and thank you panel.
Um I can't
remember who it was
that mentioned that
we needed to get
LFC to
fund, you know,
everything that is
mentioned in
the
settlement.
Does
anyone?
>> Thank you representative.
Um
It's, it's not necessarily
fund everything, but
it's tie the funding
to tie the budget to the
settlement. Um
uh With at one
point um we had a
conversation with um I
believe it was Secretary V
Hill asking her,
you know, is, is
the budget
reflective
of what needs to happen
to implement the settlement.
And as
I recall, it was pretty clear
that it wasn't.
And so our
recommendation is
when the budget is
presented,
inquire
as to that
connection.
>> I think Mr
Chair and um theres
that, I think that's a really
good idea and then something
we should be um
as a committee
um working to
support and
we have LFC
um
staff that could
help us do that and make
sure that when
we talk
to um CYFD
again to and
get the information
we need. Like Representative
Kates was talking
about that we can
go through and say
these are things that are tied
to the budget and you know,
need to happen and
implement it. And I think
that you're right that that's
very important.
And also,
um I would like
to um
Mr Hausen uh
work with
you um since I'm from
Donan and
care about this issue,
um I'd like to, you
know, help get those
recommendations,
um implemented and
enforced
>> chair and Vice chair and
Representative Ferrera, we would
look forward to
working with you. I would also
mention about the finance
piece and you heard a lot
from the LFC
and their presentations
about and
Senator Ortiz Pino
remarking about the fact
is HSD
and CYFD are supposed to be
working together on all
this and $20
million came to HSD
and they didn't spend it,
spent maybe 100,000
it and Senator TZ
Pino remark it got
authorized, but it was a
lost opportunity
to build this network. We're
trying to rebuild
and nothing
happened.
And so,
you know, that's what's frustrating
is when it's being said
that they're working hand in hand
and working closely
that this
doesn't, something doesn't
happen. So now there's gonna be 10
million here and 10 million there,
but it's still gonna require
collaboration
because we're, there's such
a heart and commitment by
this legislature to rebuild
this Behavioral health services
network.
>> Thank you very
much,
>> Representative Thompson
and she'll be followed by Representative
Jones and then we'll just come right
around.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
So, um I
think I have more statements
than questions. But
I think it was
you Mr Hussey.
And that talked about the, or
maybe it wasn't the young
lady who had ID
D and was
never identified
and tell into her
teens if,
then,
and
you know, we're all about
early intervention
and, and the
fact that she was not
diagnosed and therefore
no one really knew
how to
treat her. Essential.
I mean, I have a son with autism.
I don't, I didn't treat him
the same way. I treated my son
without autism because it
didn't work
essentially. And
so we set that girl
up for that for her
entire life that we
didn't, we didn't address
those issues and have,
and then as a foster
parent that's got to, I mean, I don't
know if she ever got into a
foster home
but you get a
kid. I mean, I can't
imagine. And my,
my son is severe
but him showing up at someone's
house and they not have
any idea of how to deal
with him. It
would be, I mean, he literally
would punch holes in the walls
and ceilings and break every
window and break the
windshield in the car and,
and, and no
foster parent is going to
want to keep that.
Um, and so
it, it just,
it, it frustrates
me and angers me and
saddens me.
And,
um, but I'll go on from
that. Um, yesterday we
heard a lot of, a lot of
celebration about how they're
almost down to
200% of a
caseload. That is
not a reason to
celebrate. I
mean, it's,
it's, I guess it's better than
1000% or
500%.
But that's,
and it wasn't, we're not even there
for the whole state. So,
of course, we've got turnover
when you're expected to do
twice the work that
you're capable of doing
and you feel like you need to do
it. Moral
injury is going
to get
you out of that job
quicker than,
than low pay or
anything else. So,
and then um this
is just an idea that
I've been um
rolling around in my head
for some years and I just
like to hear
any, any input that you
might have is that a child
who has an ace score
of three or
four
automatically qualifies
for fit programs and fit
programs are much
more wrap around.
I mean, there can be a social worker,
there can be a speech and language with
all, just a nutrition, you know,
whatever and those,
those systems are much
more robust
and, and community.
I mean, basically
the whole state is covered
by some early intervention
agency. So just
just I only have 12
seconds. So
go
>> um I'll say two things
briefly. First of all, the
who Doctor Davis uh described
that client, who is my
client. It was
a he not a she but it
doesn't matter. And
um once he was
identified having
a until, you know, development
disability, he then,
which won't be news to you waited
on the waitlist for eight years
until he was accepted.
And that was eight years of in and
out of treatment
facilities actually visited every
single one where he, he
kept getting thrown out for
not responding. And he also punched
holes in the wall.
So once it finally got
identified, which is five years
into being
in foster care, then it was nine
more, eight more years until
he got on the DD waiver
and has since struggle
and, uh, we didn't really
touch on it. But wraparound services
is like huge in
terms of an
absolute for Kevin
as it keeps someone asked earlier
about prevention, it keeps
kids in home
because you can bring the
services there.
So we absolutely
recommend an
incredible and, and it's
part of the cap
is to increase the
wraparound services
available.
Um, and
if they haven't met the numbers
that we're committed to, so, yes,
we totally support that. It's a
phenomenal
one solution to what we've
been talking
about.
>> Representative
Jones.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair
and uh, presenters
are really appreciate your
perspective. I feel like
as, as
frustrated as I've been over the
last two years listening to
this over and over again and
what seems like not making
progress. The fact
that I'm not really familiar
with Kevin S
is just,
it's like another blow
to me to think that
we have something we can work
with and, and
it's just not being focused
on. I,
I was going to ask you a real
simplistic question. It's kind
of been addressed all the
way around.
How do we hold them accountable? I
mean, that sounds simple. But
how do we do that
legislation?
I think I heard someone say
something about judicial
action. Maybe I was imagining
that. But, but what
can we do about this crisis
where Children are suffering?
And I don't, I don't want to
see us,
you know, next,
next session
comes around, next, interim
comes around, we hear exactly the
same thing. I just can't, I
can't even tolerate the thought
of that. So how, how do
we proceed? Do you have thoughts
about
that
with holding them accountable to be
specific?
>> Well, I Mr chair
members of the committee, I'll start off
with the first one and that
is Presbyterian
is now gonna be the single
MC O for kids in state
custody.
I think a good thing would
be to hold them accountable.
Like how are things
gonna be different? How are
things gonna be better under this
system? What are you going
to do? That's
gonna make more services
available to kids, more
treatment, foster care homes
available, better
care coordination,
which has been a fiction for
so many, so many
years here. So I think
that's one of the things and that,
that leads to HSD
or the HC A
holding the MC OS
accountable because we
can't forget about this. This
child welfare
system is
dependent upon
services and
Medicaid services.
So that would be one
thing. The other,
the other thing is as
we try to search
is is continue to
push towards implementation
of continual
reports.
And in reference to the
co neutrals, I I
think you a
as as a
body could benefit
more beyond
the reports by hearing from the
co neutrals about
their ideas, their
expertise. Let's bring
that in experience
into the room
as to what they've done
because New
Mex, New Jersey
is, was like New
Mexico in
other states were like us.
So how do we
move? How do we
progress, how do we
implement? So those
are just a couple of my suggestions.
Representative.
>> Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr
Chair. Um
Another thing that I thought of,
I know several of us have talked
about getting into
like um
grassroots cyfd
meeting with the deputy
secretary and so forth.
Um I just feel like
maybe we should look at as a
committee having a
sub-committee that could
focus and report
and maybe, you know,
focus our energies rather than
each one of us going
different directions and maybe
not making progress. It's just my
thoughts. Thank
you.
>> Thanks, Representative
Senator
Pinto.
>> Thank you, Mr, chair members of
the committee and thank
you for your presentation.
These stories are not
that old, they're
new. I have a few
of my own, but when you
do talk to someone, you do
see that passing of the
burden that, oh,
we'll wait another year,
let them get out of the
system. They'll be out of
high school, they'll be on to
mid school. Um You'll see
it from administrators
and that's not
something that should be happening
even at the local level.
When we talk about communities
taking this on or
even highlighting the issues,
they don't want to receive a black eye
for it because it's
happening in their community.
But yet there's a disconnect.
So when you talk about all these entities
coming together, when
have they ever been, come,
brought together
I mean, we're saying, well, Cyfd
was here yesterday. Why
weren't we all in the room at the
same time? Why wasn't
Presbyterian here
too?
We've advocated, advocated,
advocated. Now we're into the
next step. Let's be
active. What
are we going to do next here
as a legislature? Because
we know right now what we
are doing year after year, what
we hear, we haven't
changed the way we do business
either. We're saying,
oh, well, we have the interim meetings
come to the interim. It is
not enough to have a day.
It sounds like we need months
but not just here in this
community, but throughout
the state of New
Mexico,
we can put money out
there. But if
they don't want to come and get it,
that's out of our hands.
Um But two, I think
some communities don't really realize
they do have gaps in their
services. They don't
realize what is happening
there and how do we
fill those holes
because they won't, like I said, they
want to shy away from
it.
And for this particular issue
when we talk about Children and the
confidentiality,
I don't know if that
seems like that's more of an
excuse to not
really uh
do anything for
them and
that's very
troublesome.
So I hope,
I think we need to change. I think
we need to do something else
besides right here and wait
until the next meeting.
I hope those of us
that are here really consider
because I know we don't
have staff to organize
this for
one legislator to
take this on is not
enough. So
I hope there's a series of
things that do happen and bring
everybody to the table so they
really can see
face to face and hear what
they have to
do. Thank you mister
Chair
>> just in, in connection
with that. If
you can stay till the end
of today, we do want
to spend a little bit of time
orienting ourselves
brainstorming about
what we would like to see done
around Cyfd.
So that
might be the time.
Senator
Lopez. Thank >> you, Mr Chair. I
have three questions and in the interests
of time and they're all very different. I'm
gonna throw them all out and see what
we get. The
first one on page 16
of the, of the Coals
report.
I see that there's an
overrepresentation
of Latinos in the
system.
Um And I'm
interested in the, the report doesn't
address the issue of why
and I'm interested in whether
there is cultural
training and
parental support for
these Children who are removed from their
home. And I
always, when we were dealing with some
of the families, when I was at
Enasa and they would be
removed and the foster
parents would get all this support and
this money and everything. And
I kept thinking, wow,
if this mother
had gotten that kind of
support, she might have made
it so one
that's a question about
overrepresentation.
Why? And is there training
of people before they remove these
Children and support for
the families before they remove these
Children? Number one,
then the second very different
question, it was mentioned
that there are companies,
a company that was owned
by a clothes company in New
Mexico that hosts these
Children out of state.
I always like to follow the
money and
I'm like, what is the
money going out of state for
these Children?
How much money
and, and how
do they make sure we don't have those
resources here?
Um And who
is this company that closed
here? And then we're sending them
out of state? That's number
two. And then the
third, this
shift in
um Presbyterian
being the M the MC
O, I noticed that last
time and I'm concerned
because these Children are on Medicaid
and already have their doctors
set up. And
it's one of the things I hear
about with foster parents
is having to deal
with all of, you
know, how hard it is to deal with
all these appointments and
getting new doctors and finding
new doctors and then new specialists
and ever. So
why the shift?
And I know you just recently
said you want to hold uh
this MC O
accountable. I'll just
tell you again, following the
money when you get,
when you have an MC O, they get
this pot of money and their
incentive is to reduce
the spending.
So it's interesting to
me that we chose another
for-profit entity,
different one to
provide care for people in
state custody
when they already have doctors.
So those are three questions
and please
go.
>> I'm gonna quickly respond to the
first question.
Um The
overrepresentation of Children
in the system, foster parents,
not our parents,
not getting the same support as foster
parents. Right now today,
foster parents get no
support.
It, it, well,
they, the, the
Children get a daily
rate um for
their care and it's minimal
when, when we're talking about support
that they need, they don't not even given
information about what the children's
diagnoses are. But
what I wanted to point out is this
really cute um
handy
pamphlet that was, I
guess handed out by CYFD
was here on the
table. I would love
for everyone to ask about this
first section multilevel response.
When families need more intensive
services, they can be referred to
CF D's multilevel response
services for case management.
I have yet in 21
years seen
a client or a family refer
to this. I asked about it in the
Dunkley lawsuit. Depositions. No
greater moment
could have happened where they would have referred
that mom, they
didn't do it. The workers didn't even
know about it. So
that's that's question number
one.
Sorry,
>> just I'll make this
really brief. I was the one who mentioned
the out of state kids who
are still going to
the the sort of mother
companies, the oversight
companies. And
there's about, you know,
at any given time there's probably
now 13
to 15, there were, there
were 60
then there was 100 and 80
before that out of
state. There's only 13
right now,
what I use that
for is just to represent
the,
so it's not the cost, that's the
issue. It's the quality of their
care. I'll just put it like
that and it's the
same at all of
those facilities. It's just,
it's sort of a fiction that we
believe if you send a kid
to a treatment
program that,
that's enough.
And so it's, it's not a huge
cost and they have made progress
on bringing those kids home
as
well.
>> And to your other question, um,
yes, we should look at the
system that we
pay a foster
parents a certain maintenance each
month, give it to the
parents when
appropriate beforehand.
Um, and we're actually part
of a,
um,
committee that I think Senator
Lopez set up looking at the children's
code and that's going to be
some of the recommendations is that
poverty itself is
not and not
a, not a GLC
and what it would take to
shift that money. It's title four
money from the federal government.
They're opening that up. I
don't know all the details, but it
absolutely should be looked at
if that is the
issue and we have
the money and it is,
it, we'll take some switching
because it is federal for
money. But
there's much more push
from the Feds in terms of looking
at these prevention things.
So that when poverty is the
main issue, they
can get $1000 a month,
they can get the food things that will
go to the foster. So
we totally agree with that and
it's worth really looking at it exploring
and see what it would
take.
>> Thank you, Senator uh
representative
Lord.
>> Thank you um
Sharon. Thank you for experts.
I feel like the building's on fire and I'm
trying to put it out with this cup.
It is so overwhelming
because there's, I wrote so many notes
or so many problems on so
many levels and
it's extremely frustrating when
CFD comes in and they
didn't give us anything to
look at any data. So
I have to purely go by what they're
saying instead of their being,
we're getting an echo. Can you turn
off your
mic?
So,
ok, so we have multiple issues, right?
We we got a kid that's in need.
The kids should be the priority in
everything. But is an
issue where the parent needs resource
or is it a narcissistic
abusive parent that will not change?
It's going to beat this kid as a pedophile.
Is it extreme extreme
abuse? How do we take the kid out? Where do
we put them? Ok. It's like a spaghetti.
Now, I'm throwing them in the spaghetti strainer.
I don't know where the hell they're going. I
don't know what is happening to them. I don't
know where the money is going. They keep, everybody
keeps requesting money,
money is going over here.
I tried to allot 20 million but there's
20 million loss and then it's back and
it's all over the place. So
there's a lot of hidden
stuff and I and I agree
with Senator Pino. I think we should have had
this. We need
a sub-committee on this. This is too
large to tackle in the short
of a time period. We need
like three days just to deal on
this and then monthly meetings
to say, ok, we all
discussed this. Here's our
wonderful note taker here.
We'll,
we'll discuss this. Is there follow
up? Did we get follow up? Did this get
handled?
Because it's like every time I come,
we're like, we should be doing this. We're doing
that, but it's not
getting implemented and
then money's not going to implement
it. So why in the hell are we sitting here trying to
drop bills when nothing's getting done and
nothing's getting done because there's no
accountability. We don't
have an ombudsman. We
don't have any oversight.
We have people doing a pilot
study who are saying, hey, this is how
we should be doing things. Nah
not going to do that.
So there's issues all over the place that
can be handled on this short
time frame period. So my
advice won't for the because
I can't be here for the, the meeting
on the what we should be doing.
This needs a hell of a lot more time
than just this. We need a lot of
time. We also
need people to
present
like CFD present. And
you guys kindly
rebuttal and say, well, what
about this? And what about that? Because you
have a little bit different
insight and how things should be
handled. But
you know, then if we take a child
and we take them out, where are we putting
them? Ok. Well, they're staying in an office.
Do we have enough mental health? How the hell do you
get a doctor appointment anymore? I can't
get a doctor's appointment. I don't have anybody
gets a doctor's appointment. We have
a shortage of doctors. We have a shortage of
health care. We have high turnover.
How do we fix the morality?
There is a big issue.
How do we fix the morality
issue? Because that is a serious
problem. And I look in here and you guys have
this great thing that home and
read and there's a whole
discussion about with the workforce and
that's not being done and we're not
doing anything to get more people
in and we're not fixing the morale
issue and it's not even the
money. It's like, how are we giving the proper
training? And it's like
every single thing is
broken.
It's like every single thing is
broken on that.
Um, the attorneys
we have the, uh, the co neutrals
are not showing up. I mean,
how are we supposed to help these
kids where we're just
saying, ok, you're out and
you're out and you're
out and I don't know what the hell
is happening to any of these kids once
they get out, I don't know,
nobody's getting the proper
care and they, the,
uh, people that have to take the
out, the proper training. As I asked
yesterday when I was really pissed
off, like, ok, what is your
criteria for moving a child?
Can you tell me that all that
stuff should have been presented?
And it would have been nice if you guys were
here for rebuttals.
But what I'm saying is we need a lot
more time. We need a sub-committee
just to deal with this issue
because it's way too much to
tackle. And I don't want
us to start drafting up
bills that
things have already been done. There's pilot
studies, there's
sign, there's data,
there's the cines, all this stuff
needs to be addressed and why we're not
being accountable. So I was
just venting and ranting
and angry that it
just, I'm gonna come back. I,
I'm same with, uh, Senator
Jones I don't want, I'm Representative Jones. I
don't want to come back here and deal with this again. I'd
like to actually sit down in a
room if it has to be over beer
and tacos. I don't care how we get it done,
but to actually discuss this,
honestly discuss
it. Thank
you,
>> Representative
>> Garcia.
Thank you,
Mr Chairman and
thank you panel
for your presentations.
Uh, I just
have one, I just
have one question.
But uh first of all, I'd like
to compliment the
panel in
terms of your dedication, your
commitment, your
devotion to this issue,
in terms of seeing the the the
the necessary reforms
happen and that
you're willing to kind of take
that additional
step in terms of
court action to kind
of make it happen.
Uh My main
concern is
uh
the oversight
and what
exactly in the
agreement is
there regarding oversight
uh especially
for non
attainable
uh measures.
And I want to
make, bring forth an
example with the
1985 redistricting
lawsuit
in our state
that kind of really opened
up legislative seats
for Hispanics and Native
Americans and
like on the east side and the south
side of the state,
we had never had an
Hispanic in the
legislature for 100 and
25
years.
That lawsuit had an
oversight, the
Department of Justice.
So if the legislature
did not take action to
kind of bring about this equity
and redistricting,
doj
would kind of
assume
leadership and, and
provide the proper
measures
to have that equity
within the redistricting
plan
if the legislature
did not meet those
goals.
So my question
is,
and DOJ
was part of that oversight
for 10 years.
They, they bailed out
in, in 1996
after 10 years of oversight
of the Sanchez Verus King
lawsuit. So, what
do we have
in Kevin?
That is of similar
nature?
>> Thank you for that question,
Mr Chair
Representative.
So because it
is not a consent degree, it
was, it was in an
agreement, we don't have judicial
oversight that way. However,
what's built into the
agreement was if
it's not meeting the goals,
the plaintiffs that's us
can initiate dispute
resolution. We did
that, that wasn't
successful. The next
was we did it again
and got the cap that we've been talking
about because that's
been
not. The next step
is to go to formal
arbitration which we have
filed and we are taking the
defendants, which they are
the defendants to
arbitration and that's begun.
We expect to be in arbitration
in August and that will
for the first time, give us a formal
court order and
then there'll be more oversight
because that has been a
concern. I do know
in Texas we saw
recently there's a similar
case and the court there
got so frustrated. They started
fining the Child Welfare
Department $100,000
a day. So the next
step is we are going to arbitration
sometime in August
and that will end up in a court
order. We'll see.
Um But yeah, that's
important. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
That's all
ahead. Thank you,
panel. >> Thank you,
Representative Senator
Rodriguez. Did you have any
questions >> Mr
Chairman at this point? I don't.
Thank you. May I just make a short
statement? Just quickly?
Thank you. Good morning to everyone
for your work and your presentations.
Uh Mine will be short.
Basically, I've heard
this for a long time
and, um, I know
Kevin a wasn't there,
um, many, many years ago
but it is today and for several
years and I can
only see the
disconnect.
Um, I have seen
that there is a lack of
that, um, that
one point, that
place where we
can bring
all these frayed pieces
together.
Uh, there's just too many
places, too many pieces,
too many different
areas that
we have to bring
into one point to
be able to succeed.
Uh As long as we
continue to have
this, I I picture
kind of like my fingers. Here's a
hand and there are all these fingers
and we just can't bring them
together into one place for
example. And I
just um I don't know
how we're going to do it,
but I can
tell you that um
there is definitely an awareness
that something needs to be done
to get this finally under
control and
underway. And I want to thank you for your
work and that's
all I have Mr Chairman.
Nothing really offered as far as
recommendations because
we have so much to do. Thank
you.
>> And I
think II I, I'll
wrap it up with a few
comments and questions.
Um
Your presentation has been incredibly
helpful,
the
if for no other reason and there
were plenty of other reasons, but
just mentioning the fact that the
co neutrals are on our
payroll.
I mean, here are two
brilliant
successful child
welfare administrators.
I mean, maybe we did, we did a
national search, we didn't find
anybody, but we've got two on the
payroll already
and we should be
using them. I mean,
the whole point of it being a
settlement rather
than a consent decree and a
court judgment and a federal
monitor looking down our
throats was to
make it a collaboration
to work together.
But the department has been very
defensive. I mean, they were defensive
yesterday
and, and the fact that they
don't give us much
information
and I'll give you one little
example. We
asked last year for
Exit Interviews. Could
you show us what the, what the
workers are saying is the
status of the, of,
of what's going on in
the department when they leave. You
do, we found out they did,
they hadn't told us they
did Exit Interviews, but we
pried that information
out and we got
copies of the Exit
Interviews
which were page
after page of black
lines as everything
except the,
you know, the, the, the,
the, the not even the name but, but
the child
welfare worker, blank
blank black black,
all everything was redacted.
Why go through that
exercise? Why just
don't say we don't want to
give you any damned
information?
That was
ridiculous.
But, but, but, you
know, and we can't really talk about
the, the people running the department
now because it's a completely
new
group of people. But every six
months, it's a completely different
group of people. That's, I mean,
here's Blaylock
is the name on here. We, we're three
secretary. We're two
secretaries away from
him. Uh,
and that's just two years
ago
and the people that are, that we
were introduced to yesterday,
we don't have their
names
and I hate to say this,
but I, I'm not sure
I want to learn their names because the
last group was names. We
learned they're all
gone.
The turnover is just
astronomical, not just
at the caseworker level, but at the
managerial level,
I, I think
we ought to make a point
of inviting the because the co
neutrals would be available to us as
resource people to. We ought
to invite them to another
meeting. Maybe our meeting
in
we or we
all weed
everything already. But at
some point, we'll, we'll work
out a time to invite
the co neutrals to, to
meet with us to give us and
we'll invite the, the department
back at that meeting to,
to, you know, to be there with
us. We really need to find
out what's the most helpful thing
we can do. I proposed last
year a thoroughgoing
restructuring not
of the department. I don't care
what the divisions are of the
bureaus or the
regional managers,
but of how we make
policy in the
department and what we, how we make
policy now is behind closed
doors in a cabinet
meeting. Nobody
knows what goes on in the cabinet.
We don't know if
HSD and, and
CYFD are really collaborating.
We don't see the fruits
of collaboration, but that
may not be, I mean, it just may
take a while to germinate and
produce fruit,
but it's going
on behind closed doors in a cabinet
meeting.
Um I
thought if we had a
commission and
the meetings were open public
meetings that the
policies made by the
commission would
be to that
extent, much more transparent,
much less defensive,
much more prone
to be
supported by the public.
And the big thing that the department
lacks right now, I will tell
you is public
support. They can't
recruit foster parents because
foster parents don't want
uh I don't know
the, I see it on TV.
I, they can't recruit workers.
They can't fill the four e
vacancies that they have. Pay
for your and pay
for your a stipend. They
can't fill them because I
don't know,
public support is
just lacking for
the department. How will we restore
that is the key.
So maybe the commission
idea is not the way I,
I, you know, II I
thought that would, that
might take a step in that direction.
I'm open for other
ideas. We could,
we could pursue that.
But I do think we, we, we
can't just let it go at this.
We just have to keep
asking for information,
availing ourselves of
what's been done
and trying to
find out how the pilot's working.
Maybe. I mean, it sounds like there's some
great ideas, you
know, grassroots
tangible hands-on
ideas that if
implemented would make a
difference.
There's got to be ways to recruit.
Although I, I would say,
you know, and I know Dr
Davis's comment about
the foster home
being, you know,
you've got
to
have a caring
environment that, that, that,
that, that the child can grow
up in. I don't
know how to find foster parents
in an era where we've
made two parent
working families the
norm. And if you
want to survive financially,
you gotta have both your people
out there holding two
jobs and
who's left to be foster
parents, you know,
maybe, maybe single,
uh retirees
out of. I don't know. But,
but it's just, it's
not the old days when
there were a lot of
when I start off as a child. Well,
we welfare
worker, several of
my foster families were
in, I was in Doanna
County were in, uh
Salem and these
little farming communities
up the valley
and, and they had big
farms and they could take six
or seven kids and
there were plenty of bedrooms
because they had six or seven kids
in the room. They were all grown
and that's not what we're seeing
now. I mean, we're not seeing,
you know, these
people that just love being
parents who are got
big hearts and available.
There are some but not as many
as there used to be and
it's, it's just, it's a different
world. But the key would be
what we heard yesterday from the guy
from Annie Casey,
the upstream work
and the, and the broadening
work so that we're not just
providing services for the
kids in our custody,
we're providing services for the
community and we're
heading off the need to provide
foster care
that the ultimately,
I mean, I, I don't
think it's a losing game to try
to keep up with the need for foster
families by recruiting
more.
We've got to reduce the need for
foster families. Ultimately.
That, that, that has to
be and that's what they did in New
Jersey, those data he showed
us and New Hampshire,
both
the number of, of, of kids
needing foster placements went down
when they put, put the focus
upstream
anyhow, lots of ideas,
lots of things. You
have another question,
Mr Chair, do we
invite HSD
for these
presentations for this
week? Since they are
intricate part of the
we are, we
have behavioral health
is one of the big topics we're going
to do. We
already, it, they'll be
here in July and
August.
Well, I mean,
the behavioral health services
that they provide are the ones that we want
to make sure are
integrated
and, and the Medicaid
issue. I mean, we, we,
you know,
we did hear about the
turquoise care already, didn't
we? And they'll be providing a
more detailed report
in July on, on
turquoise care and how that on
how they what they think
is the reason for going for
the single MC O
for all the kids in, in state
custody.
We'll see.
I mean, I, I don't know if that's a
good idea or a bad idea.
It has
some,
some value, I guess. Uh
It, it
certainly having
four separate MC OS is pretty
complex right now.
But if we go
to
um
the state credentialing
and the network being the same
for all the MC OS, then it
obviates the need to have a single
MC O but, but
that's, that's another
matter.
Ok. I, I could ramble
on for a long time. I don't, I don't
want to just
talk incessantly
here. Um Gary
one last comment, >> 11
la chair members of the
committee, one last
comment
in the midst of our despair,
we are hopeful,
we are hopeful. This, this
can be fixed. Reform
requires
persistence,
vision
and on behalf
of the team, we're gonna be
here at your next meeting, the meetings
after that, we're, we're in it for
the long haul. We've been here for
four years and there's
frustration
with the lack of progress,
but we remain committed
to support
improving this system of
care for kids and supporting
CYFD and HSD
and achieving that
the only thing I will add to
this is to punctuate.
This is
once again read to you the quote
from Martin Luther King over
60 years ago.
And he said we are
now faced with the
fact that tomorrow
is today,
we are confronted with the
f fierce urgency
of now in
this unfolding conundrum
of life and history. There is
such a thing
as being too
late.
Procrastination is still
the thief of time.
Life often leaves us standing
bare naked and dejected
with a lost opportunity.
The tide and affairs of
men does not remain at the
flood. It
ebbs. We may
cry out desperately for
time to pause
in her passage. But
time is death
to every plea and
rushes on
over the bleached bones
and jumbled residue of
numerous civilizations
are written. The pathetic
words too
late.
There's an invisible book of
life that faithfully
records our
vigilance
or our neglect,
the moving finger
writes and
having writ moves
on. We
have this opportunity.
We need to persist.
We don't for some of these
kids, it has
been too late for
others. It's getting
there. So that's why
I encourage us all to
devote the energy,
the passion, the
wisdom to
building a better system for
our kids and
families.
>> Well, your, your
presentation today
launches us hopefully on
that path and we really appreciate
everything you've said. Thank you.
So much. And
we, we have another panel now
on the community
from the community partners of
Cyfd, some, some of
the community partners
we're going to hear from Robert
Chavis at youth
development.
Please. We, we have to keep,
keep on and incidentally,
we're not going to break for lunch.
We, we think we can wrap
it up and go home. >> I'm
sorry, can you please take
your conversations
out?
>> So we're going to hear now from
Robert Chavez from
YD I
Sarah Penn from New
Day and Jennifer
Thompson from PB
and
J,
what are we doing Timewise
over
about ready to wrap it
up?
We're just one hour
late
and they're starting at two in
here. So we don't have
any, we don't have any. We'll get
out of
here.
Thank
you.
Yes.
Who's, who's gonna kick it
up? Robert? Are you, are you going first
or does it
matter?
Why don't you go ahead and
start
and it needs to be turned on.
So you push that light
on there. You
got it. Ok. So >> red lights
on. Not off.
Ok. Well, good
morning, Mr chair madam, chair
members of the committee. Thank you
for inviting me to share
about the services that we're providing.
At YD I
um
it's hard, there's, there's a lot of noise behind
me. It's hard to
talk
the
presenter.
Yes.
Thank you. Thank you.
So at, at YD I, we've been
providing services in the community
since 1971. We
started here in Bernal Leo
County, actually Dead
Man's corner um
to address um
um substance abuse and gang
per uh intervention. Those are our
first services and
since 1971 we've been
growing services
from within
Burn Leo County and to 10
0 counties. Because
what we've learned over the years
of providing services, we started
off providing service to the two
young young adults,
youth, right? Youth Development Incorporated
YD I but what we
learned is in order to
make a difference to a young
person and a child,
we really have to work with the
entire family. So
even though we're youth development,
we've been the last 1015 years.
We've been expanding to more family
services from anywhere
from individuals who
are, don't have Children
to pregnant moms
to grandparents,
raising their Children. So
we have a variety of services.
Um At YD I, we have
uh about 520
staff right now should be at
about 5 55
60. But with some
vacancies and new programs, we
do have some openings there.
Um I mentioned we're in 10
counties, so we're in pretty
much central New Mexico.
Then we're in Eddie County,
we're in Doanna County,
Sandoval County, Torrance,
Cibola, Bernalillo, Santa
Fe and Edie
County. And the type of
services that we provide in each
county varies pending
on the need, the
financial resources to provide
the services and
our mission is to partner with
families to help solve life's
problems, right? Um
We do it by offering a
supportive environment
for families. Um
We also make sure that
um we, we have proven
results. We've been doing it 51
years every, it seems like
every month we have some type of audit
happening from some type of funding,
we have over 50 different funding
sources for the agency. So
we're con continually
being audited
and reviewed for our
services. Why
D I is broken up to four
service divisions,
early childhood and education,
right? So under early childhood
and education that we
have 29 early childhood
centers across the state,
we have uh 20 here
in Bernalillo County.
10 up in Rio
Reon, Taos County.
Ok. Um We also
have home visiting. We're one of the largest
home visiting providers
in the state. We have federal
home visiting from head early head
start. We have state home
visiting and we have a
nurse, family partnership and
evidence-based uh nurse home
visiting program here
as well in in early childhood
development. The
second division we have
within um yd
I is prevention intervention and
behavior hall. So
prevention and intervention in
behavior hall, there are a lot
of our shelters, our
outpatient counselings, our
crisis services
um are within that
division. Um We
have a new program that will be starting.
Well, we started hiring staff child
first is another evidence-based
program we're bringing in
to, to, to
provide uh
much-needed behavioral health
services to our Children. And
families. The third
division we have is education,
employment and training.
So with the education,
employment and training, we hire,
we hired 350 young
adults last year where
they come in and work with the development
and gain experience in
different industries throughout
Central New Mexico.
Right? So, um
that's one of our largest programs
in there. We've also a youth build
provider. So we're now training
kids, uh young adults
on exposing them to
trades and trying to
get them um based
on their interest going
into, into those careers
or trades. We've also
been doing a lot
of violence intervention and prevention
under that department now.
So what we've been doing is hiring
therapists and case managers help
decrease violence, right? We
find that violence escalates because
there's some type of trauma in the household.
So under our education employment
program, we've been doing a lot of
those. We've also been doing
a lot of reentry work
under that division.
So in early childhood,
you know, it's really comprised of
seven different programs
and that's where we have about 300
of our current 520
employees that we have.
Um I mentioned the counties
we serve and those are
basically center based services
for Children in need of
them. So what we do at our head
start centers and early childhood
centers is we do
um assessments for behavioral
health and we make sure that those kids
who need those services are,
are, are receiving them. We do
health vision, we do health
visions, hearing
examinations, heights,
weights to make sure they're
trending where our young
people need to be doing in early
childhood. So it's everything
within home, early childhood. But then
we also have home visitors and,
and service specialists
assigned to those families.
Because when we're in our classrooms,
addressing the needs of the
child, we're also
assessing what are the needs
of the families. And then
we're providing support to help them
use that whether it's education,
whether it's it's high school equivalency,
whether it's job training, whether
it's it's providing housing
support. Um And
in that division, like the
population is usually
prenatal to five years
old. Um So
I've mentioned head start.
Um early head start is a
form of head start. We've been
transitioning since there's been an
expansion in preschool.
We've been transitioning a lot more
to early head start. That is six
weeks to three years of old,
three years old. So a younger
population, we've been transitioning a
lot of our centers to, to provide
that service just because of the increase
in early childhood across the state.
We feel that's another area
where we could continue to
provide support.
Um We have Pre
K New Mexico, pre K
services So head
start has income guidelines
that we have to adhere to federally.
It's federally funded, it is about $60
million we get from health and
human services. So with
state pre K, it's allowing
us to serve
families that don't have
that other qual
otherwise qualify for head
start in our centers. Right.
So it's really expand,
expanded the number of
families. Uh, we can
serve. Um, we also have a
pregnant women's services program
that provides home
visitation um
to pregnant women um
by case managers,
um early head start program
again, that's home visiting for
our families who have early
preschool age Children.
We have um nurse
family partnership again. I have
nine nurses on
staff now that we
work um targeting
mothers or pregnant moms
who have a history of substance
abuse um in
Burnel County or Reri
County. And we're going to look
at Valencia Counties on our road
map next. But basically
we have a half of nurses that work
with the prenatal,
all developing the
relationship on what
the mom needs
um as they're going through
pregnancy and then post
pregnancy. And that's a
very high impact of
our, you know, program with
us as our nurse family partnership.
It's, it's a different type of home
visit when a nurse uh shows
up bringing the doorbell in their
schmock to, to come
in and do this family assessment
and stuff. So that's a new one. It's had some
great evidence-based
model. It's a great program.
Um Our prevention and be
health programs that we have.
That division has 22
different type of programs.
Um um
130 23
staff positions.
We have those services are
in Bernal Leo Sandoval,
Valencia, Torrance, Silla
Edie and Santa Fe County.
Um So their ranges,
their services and and
our prevention, our
prevention intervention,
beh behavioral health
services division, a
really a range of
services for
um working with
kids who are coming out of foster
care, kids who are homeless,
right? Transitional living crisis,
stabilization services,
we work with, we have adverse
child experiences. So we have
staff that work with families
who are who, who support
families who had some type of
trauma in their lives or had some
type of violence, some type
of neglect or abuse
that's happening. We also
have our community-based
prevention intervention
program. Again, more
family support services
for um
youth families that
have Children 0 to
18. Um And again,
they just provide intervention and
stabilization services.
Um For Children, we have
individual coun counseling,
outpatient services for
families. We have an
independent futures program which
is case management to focus
on housing 16 to
24. Um That's
where we do a lot of transitional living
or independent living skills.
And then we have a neutral corner
which provides supervision, uh
supervised visitation
for families who
need exchange services.
Or if there's even you're talking
about parents who foster
care parents. If there's exchanges
or if there's or that are
necessary or sometimes
the visits with the mom and the
parents. We're able to
provide that oversight at our
Neutral Center.
We have our Amistad Crisis
shelter. It's one of our legacy
programs for youth development. We're
doing been doing it for years,
short term emergency
um shelter services for
youth um ages 12
to 17. Um
Casa Hermes, Hermosa
is a transitional living program we
have for youth in the community.
Um Those are for ages
16 through 21.
Casa North is another housing
program that we have for youth
involved in child welfare,
juvenile justice.
Um and and
those are for ages 16 to
23 summer
house is another um
crisis driven facility
for price stabilization.
Those are used with higher acuity
levels that need some
more support. So it's more
24 7 care one
on one on two kind of
staff match staff ratio to
help them support. And
then Florida, this is a transitional
living apartment complex. We
acquired one thing with housing
shortages when we had folks
exiting uh
foster care or in the
kids reentering young
adults. I call them kids because I'm getting
older but young adults
who are reentering the community
housing was difficult. So
working with different legislative
partners were able to get capital
outlay to purchase a 26
unit apartment complex
where we could actually have not
have, we're the landlord and we're able
to let folks come in and
live with us. So we teach them all the
support services they need.
Um So that's prevention
intervention and behavioral health.
Um And I thought
there was a clock somewhere. I'm trying to make
sure I stand time, but I don't see the
clock. So and
I'll just let me know,
education, employment and training.
That's one of our third division with
us. So that one has 13 programs.
We have 40 staff in there and that's
when we employed 350
youth this past year
um we serve Bern Leo Sandoval
and Torrance. So we do
um alternative education
through uh through higher
ed. We're able to provide a GD
program, high school cli
program that we graduate
students, uh adults who need
their high school diploma. We
have our workforce development
programs, which I mentioned
earlier, we have a mentoring
program so we can tie uh young
adults with mentors if needed
if they're interested. We
talked about our violence prevention
program we have within
um our education
employment and then our reentry
services that we provide. So we
start working with
incarcerated who
about our nine months to be
released and then we start doing their
assessments and making sure they have
all their benefits, their housing
stabilized, what we're gonna do, what kind
of follow up they did they
need. So that's an education
and employment training.
Um Talked about a
B er adult education.
We have hope mentoring again. Those
are uh it's a younger mentoring
program for 8 to 16 year olds
that provide group mentoring. It matches
Children and youth to adult
mentors.
Um Petrol
cliff going on now, we
hired eight youth this
year to um
uh renovate
or create new paths in the
petrol cliff. So they gain job
experience and with the hopes of
getting into the Forest Forest
Department, fresh start
re residential
treatment. Um We're able
to pay young folks who are in
transitional living who are
looking for a place to live but
yet cannot afford
them. We're able to provide
housing support where we could pay
six months rent up to
$10,000
total for them to get
into a place stabilized.
Then we help them with the job, the
management to support independent
living. So that's under fresh
start. And then our job
mentorship is actually a partner,
a partnership with the city of
Albuquerque where federal
pass through where we
actually pay the youth who are
participating in their mentorship
program at, at Albuquerque
Public Schools.
Chances and project evil
are programs that we have
that are reentry, right?
One is funded by uh
federal funding and
one's funded by the,
by uh
the
um city of
Albuquerque. And there in
those programs, what we've done is
we've used peers, right?
When you look at our substance abuse
programs and our, our reentry
programs, we hire folks
peers with life experience
who have served some
type of crime befo uh
served time before
to be able to work and with folks
who are reentering the reentering
communities.
Um
youth build I mentioned again
and we're just getting
ready to get a new peer support
services program.
Um
And that's yd I and
30 seconds. So a
little longer than that, I'm
sorry, it feels that way when I'm
presenting to 20 people.
So any
questions about the organization or
anything, >> we'll,
we'll come back with, with more
specific questions for you.
But after, but could you just
go over the funding chart?
>> Funding chart? Yeah, you could see.
Right. If you look at our funding, we're over
40 $40 million in
funding. Right? And it
tells you of our, of our
funding, 23 million
is federal. You look
at the state funding as
9 million a little bit over and
then we have unrestricted funding. Those
are foundation type funders that
provide us funding and we have
private funding, different, different
donors, different fundraisers,
different things that hand out privately
or um city
funding. Um, and then
county funding. So that's a
makeup. So like we said,
we have a lot of different funding
sources because we
like our services, right?
Um We try to integrate as much
services. We have many entry
points. So anybody,
you could have a mom and
get into early head start, you
could have them in our GD program,
you could have them with the nurse,
sign home visits. So
what we go out and do is everything
we do as an organization is based
on the assessment and this, I'll
get to more of the financing. So when we
look at our assessments that we
do from individual to set
to family to, to
community, then when we
find gaps, we go out and
find the fin gaps to field
the funding. So we built
in many, we have many different funding
sources that provide the services
to provide those integrated
services. So I'm not sure
Mr Chair, I hope that answered your
question. >> Does
your home visiting program get
Medicaid
>> um home visiting
um there
are home. Ok. Our, we
have the three so state home, they're
funded by E ce D.
One of >> it would be the
nurse partnership, the >> nurse partners.
Um We are nurse
partnership program
is, um, is a
Medicaid funded program.
The first start up and we have some
start up money from the national office
to begin and then Medicaid, that's
one of the few Medicaid
programs we have.
We, we don't, it's
not our funder of choice, Mr
Chair.
>> And did you have a question
or? >> Yes, I
did. Thank you. This is
really an impressive amount
of work and an
impressive
um
impressive in terms of where
you are. What I'm curious about
is how many people
individuals were being served
and how do you measure the outcomes
of the services that were
provided? >> Yeah, we could touch
and we say touch like
provides comprehensive service
to about 6000
actually just touch
like a referral,
short term they come in,
maybe we don't hire them. We're
up to about 11,000 of
families a year.
So >> how do you measure the
outcomes? >> Each,
each outcome is measured
by each program, each program we
have has a scope of work.
So and each scope
of work has deliverables
and outcomes that must be achieved.
So it really varies
on the program requirement,
the scope of work and then how
the families um are
doing through our relationship,
right? Are we retaining, you
know, you could I know we're
providing good services when our families
want to have more of our services.
I wish they didn't need our services.
But however, when they're saying,
hey, did I feel comfortable
um discussing
what issues we need and, and
when we're seeing their individual
family plans um
or their partnership agreements
as they're moving along
and progressing towards those,
those family or
individual outcomes. So
that's how we see the
achievements we have and
we have, but it just
varies per pro
program.
>> Um I, I think that that
would be in, in a future
report or maybe if you could just direct
me, you probably do these
reports because I know nonprofits have
to do this all the time.
Um I just
would be interested in, for
example, your peer
mentoring. How do, how
does that result in a higher graduation
rate or do
you know the nurses, the
nursing visit? Just just
however you measure your
outcomes, it would be good
to know your
success rate with, with
the outcomes that you
have measured for yourself.
Thank you Mr Chair.
>> And, and if you'd like Mr Chair members,
I could come back another time and just
speak about outcomes as
well
>> or, or you could give us the written
information. I, I just
because it's good to
know about the service, but it's
also great to know
how it's doing.
Thank you, Mr
Chair. >> I think we're going to hold any
other questions for White until
after we've heard from New Day and
PB and J and then
we'll, we'll go around and
people can ask a question about
anybody. So,
and just >> a reminder
that this space is
reserved at two o'clock for
someone else. So we cannot,
we probably should be done by
130.
>> Um So next,
we have Sarah Penn
from a New
Day.
>> Good morning, Mr
chairman
and the committee. My name is Sarah
Penn. I'm the Chief Program
Officer from New
Day. Thank
you for the opportunity to
speak with you today about the critical
services provided by New
Day. Our organization
is dedicated to supporting
at risk youth through a
variety of essential
programs aimed at
ensuring their safety, their
stability and overall
well-being. Today, I'll
provide you an overview of
our youth housing
supports our shelter
services, our
drop-in center and
Life Skills Academy along
with some key statistics that
highlight the impact of our
work. First,
let's discuss our youth housing
supports. New
Day offers a range of housing
programs designed to provide
safe and stable living
environments for youth
who are experiencing homelessness
or at risk of becoming
homeless. Our
goal is to ensure that these young
individuals have a secure place
to call home while they
work towards independence.
Over the past year, we housed
100 and eight individuals
across our four housing
programs. We
currently have approximately
70 young people housing
apartments throughout
Albuquerque.
Next are shelter services
offer immediate short term
housing solutions for youth
in crisis. The shelter
offers a secure refuge
where youth can access basic
needs, receive emotional
support and start
planning their next steps.
Over the past year, we have provided
approximately 20,000 nights
of shelter to youth across our
housing programs and shelter
services.
Our drop-in center is a
crucial resource for youth
who need a safe and supportive place
to visit during the day.
At the drop-in Center. Youth can access
a variety of services
including meals, hygiene
supplies and recreational
activities. In the
past year, we've recorded a
total of 4170
visits to the drop-in Center
of these visits. Approximately
2000 included a provision
of the meal, accounting for
50% of all visits.
Additionally, the drop-in Center
has met a total of
4125
individual needs for the youth who
come through our doors.
Our life skills academy is another
vital component of our services.
This program offers workshops
and training sessions to help you
develop essential life skills
such as financial literacy,
job readiness and personal
development. Through these
efforts, we've successfully built
protective factors which are
elements that enhance the use,
ability to thrive and
succeed in life. On
average, we conduct 26
life skills classes per month,
providing consistent and
ongoing support to the youth that we
serve to
give you a broader perspective on
the impact. Um
Here's some statistics from the
past year,
we served a total of
885 youth
across all of our programs,
86% of the youth
in our housing programs maintained
or successfully transitioned to
stable housing. This
high percentage reflects the
effectiveness of our housing support
initiatives in helping
youth achieve long term
stability. In
conclusion New Day is committed
to providing comprehensive support
to at risk youth throughout our
housing programs, shelter
services, drop in
center and life skills
academy. Our holistic
approach addresses immediate
needs while
also equipping youth with the
skills and resources they
need for a brighter
future. We're
grateful for your support
and look forward to continuing to
improve the lives of young people in
our community.
Thank you.
>> And
could you just explain
quickly where your money
comes from how you're financed?
>> So we're, we
have a diverse
group of, of different
finances. We have federal,
we have state, we have,
we have county
and then we do a lot of fundraising
to be able to offset the
additional expenses to be able
to operate.
>> And is your state contract
with >> CYFD? It is.
So CYFD funds
our shelter services
and we have a smaller
grant of
less than $20,000 for a
drop in center from
CYFD.
>> And then we have the
co executive director of
PB and J Jennifer
Thompson.
>> Ok, good morning,
Mr, chair, vice
chair and other members of the
committee. Thank you for
having me here today.
My name is Jennifer Thompson.
I'm a licensed clinical
social worker and I've had
the privilege of working at PB
and J for the last 22
years. Um
This has allowed me to see a lot of
changes in the system
and how, how it's impacted
the families that we work
with. And we
have currently have three
sites, one in the town
of Bernalillo, one
in the Southeast Heights and one in the
South Valley.
Uh PB and J
is currently serving
Bernalillo Sandoval in
Valencia County. And we've been in
operation for 50
years
with the ambition of to
grow and develop
Children to their full potential
in nurturing families within
supportive communities.
We do this by providing
parenting education,
child development,
life skills, case
management, and
transportation.
Our emphasis is on wraparound
services for the whole family.
Currently, we have about 80
staff uh
between the three
sites and we
serve about 1200
families a year.
Um PB and J has grown
organically over the years,
consistently changing to
meet the needs of the community.
A PB and J staff for
trauma informed diverse
college educated individuals.
Many with lived experience
dedicated to providing
support and change to families.
In New Mexico.
The staff understand the importance
of developing relationships
and trust with families
which allow them to provide
more comprehensive,
meaningful services to families
based on the family's
own unique needs.
They are trained to assess the family's
needs and work together with the
family to develop
a plan for treatment.
Uh PB and J currently has
13 different programs
funded by the state City
County and one federal
contract. Um These
services are provided in the home
and community including the
schools correctional
facilities at YD
DC M DC.
The new Mexico Correctional
Facility in Los Luns
and the Western correctional facility
in grants. Uh The
goals and the majority of our
services are 100%
parent involvement, concrete
support with connection to
resources, increasing
parity, stability and
improved uh child parent
relationships.
Uh PB and J is currently
working um to
re-establish our therapeutic
preschool program which
ran successfully for many
years but was discontinued
due to changes in funding.
The pre, the PB and J
preschool operated three days
a week with approximately 8 to
10 families attending
four hours a day with
both the parent and the
child.
Parents and Children. Birth to
five were transported to
PB and J
on an each
morning. And this
different uh from the
current New Mexico Pre K
and that this was ongoing
parent, child interaction
throughout the four hours.
Um The the families
participate in a classroom
setting, learning
the skills they need as
parents as
well as increasing the bond with their
child. They were served
breakfast and lunch in a family
style setting and then transported
home at the end of the
day.
Each family also received
home visits to address their home
environment and to allow for
more comprehensive
services.
Overall.
In this program, the families
received hands-on
intervention, allowing them to
learn new skills
while having direct access
to support from
qualified trained
professionals as well as others
families struggling with similar
challenges. They not
only learned parenting skills
but they also learned about the
child's development,
always strengthening
the relationship between the
parent and child.
This program was focused on
optimal development, family
safety, health and
stability. This
used to be referred to as the
core for several decades.
This was the heart of PB and
J. The
majority of PB and J families
are involved in the CYFD
system. The therapeutic
preschool worked collaboratively
with CYFD to provide not
only support and connection
for resources
but a way for families to have
regular visitation with their
child. If they were in custody,
often these families were referred
to another PB and J
program when their Children
are ready to reunify
with their family. And
this allowed us the opportunity
to know the family prior
to them being reunified. So we'll
be able to understand the
challenges that may come up
once the the reunification
process
started
another program that
um we are currently working
to re-establish and is drastically
changed over the years. Is our program
for incarcerated parents.
Uh Currently, our M DC
program works with many CYFD
families supporting the
visitation with
parents while they're receiving
services. A case
manager connects with the
caregiver in the community
going into the home, assessing
any needs and providing access
to available resources.
The worker is able to facilitate
the visit with the
parent and child via
tablet. We are working
to get the in-person
visits uh
reestablished.
Uh This has
been in, this
is systematically allowed Children
access to their parents and has often
decreased the recidivism rate
as indicated by a study
in the New Mexico Sentencing
Commission in March
2012, the
program was discontinued in
2011 following a
change in administration which no
longer allowed for family contact
visitation. At
that time, we had a family
visitation trailer in both Los
Nunes and Gratz. We
also had an overnight
visitation trailer in grants
which allowed mothers who the
majority of the time have limited
or no contact with their Children
during incarceration.
The opportunity
to have interactions
with their child before they were
released.
This allowed them to practice
being a parent on several
occasions before they were released
to to care for their
Children
because the majority of
mothers that are released from
prison have had limited or no
contact with their Children.
And then they're expected to
take over the full time
caregiver role once they're
released.
So in terms of
support, um increasing
to support to community
providers is one way to decrease
the burden on our already overtaxed
child welfare system.
Also, with the focus on
evidence-based programming,
it's important to allow for
additional funding to support
the evaluation of
programs.
The majority of fun of
nonprofits are also functioning
with limited administrative
funding to support anything outside
of direct services. This
leads our service providers with
additional duties outside of an
already challenging job with
inadequate pay.
An improved system would require
better communication, workforce
support and training and adequate
information sharing with
providers as well
as more available resources
for substance abuse and
housing. PB
and J is dedicated
to being part of the solution and will
continue to work to be a
positive change in the community.
Thank
you.
>> Well, very good. Now we will
go to the committee for, for
questions. And so
we have representatives, Kates
and Jones.
OK. Let me, uh
first of all, we have Garcia
Kates and Jones. Garcia had
raised his hand up earlier.
Uh So we have Garcia Kates
Jones, Chavez
Ferrari,
Anido Lous.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you panel.
I'm still chewing away at the
crunchy
bar.
You know, you guys did some excellent
work
Historically,
I'm done.
You've always been uh
focused
in those communities that need these
services from
the very get go. That's
been your foundation
in terms of your
programming.
Um
And, and actually my four
kids kind
of went through YDIS
early childhood
programs,
you know, from,
from the very beginning.
Um
you know, Robert,
um
I have some questions regarding
um how
A YD I
utilizes our
um
manufacturers
settlement
agreement.
Um
Are you
pursuing funding? Are you
getting funding
from that settlement agreement
regarding some of your
substance use
disorder programs?
What is the status
of YD I in regards
to uh
uh utilization of the settlement
moneys?
So,
>> and let me refer Jack
Jack's my vice president of
Prevention and Behavioral Health.
So on the, I'm gonna have him
come up here and help me with this. So,
on the settlement dollars you're talking
about because there are several are those
um is that
crisis stabilization,
Jack, is that what we're thinking we're
getting funding from or which
programs?
So I, yeah, I,
I don't know them as settlement
dollars. I'm having trouble
with the settlement. I, I see
them from CYFD in
regards to, you
know, either state general fund,
federal or federal funds.
So that's
where do you
know, >> we, I,
as far as
I'm,
>> oh, I'm
sorry,
>> Mr Vice Chair. Thank you.
Um, Jackie, I'm from
YD I, so,
um, we do get a
lot of funding from CYFD.
Um, and, and a lot of these
fundings are, are
usually contracts that we've
currently, that we have
had throughout the years.
And um
and I would assume that in some
of the contracts that we currently
have are
indirect results
of, of the uh the settlement
itself, we
have um child
abuse prevention programs
within seven different
counties that we
help. Um In
the past years, we serve about
3 to 500
families. Um
What I can tell you all,
I I in terms of
success in trying to keep
those families from
coming back into the
system into uh
getting reported from
sky. Um We
have a 90%
success rate in the first six
months and then a
90% success
rate in keeping them
out uh longer than
six months uh from
getting involved with the system. We
have um
uh fostering
connections, funding
for you that are in the
foster care system
um that we currently
um get fund
for our Talaya
program for young
adults.
Um
Our success rate
in that program
is that
90%
of young people that have
graduated and
are able to maintain
their own apartments and
living independently
and not get involved in the system
again. So some, so
those are some of the funding that
are coming through Cyft
that are, that
can be related to
um
to the settlement. >> And I'm
gonna ask, we
really need to stay
on time. I'm sorry
to cut it short, but
we don't have this
building >> long. Thank you, madam
chair. Thank
you,
>> Representative Kates,
followed by Representative
Jones. >> Thank
you chair and, and then thank
you presenters. I'm a big
fan of all three of your organizations
and have used them professionally
in referring for 20
years. And so I do very much
appreciate your work.
I do you have a couple of questions?
Several of them only require a
two word answer. So
please
keep them brief.
What time
period? What does it constitute a
short term housing? Is
it three days?
3090
days? What is short term
housing?
New Day? Sa
Sarah
>> short term housing for shelter
is 90 days
maximum.
>> Thank you so much.
So all three of you
have contracts with
state and city and
county.
How long is your
typical contracts
with them? Are they one year,
two years or five year
contracts?
>> Our contracts on average are
three years with annual
>> renewals.
>> Is it for three
years with an
>> ours are
typically four years
annual renewals. >> So
when the legislature or the
voters approve a minimum
wage hike or additional
benefits such as paid family
medical leave and you're in
the middle of a contract year.
Does your rate increase
as those benefits are
required?
>> Not necessarily,
it takes some time for us to
advocate and,
and the organizations
needs not where it needs to be to make those
adjustments. So, no, >> thank
you. So it
would be to have a bill
in place that would help
follow the
benefit for
your rate even in the middle of the
contract year. And my
last
question
is, what kind of
jobs or job
discovery or
employment training
does YD I provide,
do you have contracts like private
contracts with
manufacturers? Are
these city contracts to
provide crowns
keeping? Is
it with CNM? What
kind use job corre?
>> Well, we we partner with workforce
solutions. So we look at the
areas, the sector strategies
that are prioritized based
on vacancy future
high, the market
trends. Um So
those are the type of industries
that we're looking at, right
it,
nursing,
teaching those type
of professions based on
forecasting. >> So
it's training and discovery.
I do see that your great
picture here with the solar
panels. And I thank
you so
much. I'm
done.
>> Representative Jones to be
followed by Representative
Chavez.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair
and thank you all for your
presentation. Please
>> turn off your mic if you're not
using
it.
>> Yes, thank you. And I
just, I have questions
specifically for
you, Robert um
on
the nurse family
partnership home
visitation that
just really jumps out at me
because it's what I imagine
Cyfd doing
with the Navigator with
you said you have a focus on
pregnant women who
are, um, having
substance use disorder.
And so can you tell me more
about that? What kind of service
is that? How often do, are they
seen? Do you contract
with CYFD?
>> No, it, like we said, it's a
Medicaid, uh, paid for
service. We had to, we had to
go and work on that
work to be done to make it a Medicaid
paid service. But
um we, we received referrals
from, from all
entities. I I heard you talking
about the MC O SI think that's a help
needed. If we can get more from the MC
OS, that would be great. But
basically this evidence-based
model there, it's a national model
that was staged, their, their national
offices in Denver,
studied by Harvard over the
years. And we were approached
to think about the uh
bringing NFP to New
Mexico based on
the indicators
that we have in our state.
And so we did that. So we
basically hire a nurse
and a supervisor.
We send them through the national
office for curriculum
um for to
implement their curriculum
that has proven you,
Senator
Lopez wanted some uh
impacts. Well, you can
go ahead and nurse that in their families.
Harvard's been studying this for
years and it shows
when a nursing, if he has
them, there's families have less
risk of substance abuse,
less risk of living of a
domestic violence environment,
a lot less dependence
on state support
and the systems. So that's what
interests us about it because
it was a gap that we
have. So basically, we had
to apply for an application to become
a provider. They don't accept everybody,
they accepted, worked with
the state on the funding
aspect of it and
then had to train the nurses.
Our nurses actually are on board
with us about three months prior
before seeing a client because
of the intense training. And
then there's the supervision. They
see our, they could see a
minimum of our parents.
Each nurse has a capacity
of maybe
2020
parents or 20 single
moms assigned to them, their caseloads,
1 to 20 they'll see
them at a minimum of two times a
month based on the and they're
in person. We don't do virtual
training unless it's absolutely
necessary, but
it's at least two times a month.
But we find that they're
that it's more than that. And
then we also do socialization.
So we bring all the
first time moms together to
build a support group. So each month
we pick a different topic and we'll do a
socialization. And I
think that's why you're building
that, that peer
support group with,
with first time pregnant moms
as well. So I think that's why we see some
positive outcomes.
I answered your question.
Representative Jones. >> Yes,
it did. I'd like to find out more
about that and, and about
outcomes as well. How long have you
been involved in
this >> programs?
We've been 3,
2.5 years right
now.
>> Ok. I'd like to get your
contact info so I can find out
more about that. Thank you so much. Thank you,
Mr Chair. >> Just, just
a comment about that. I think there are a
couple of other agencies
in the state that use the nurse family
partnership model.
I thought one was
in Silver City.
>> There's only one
U and M was doing,
it was doing it. You are
currently our provider
NFP. But they were
focusing on families that
work in the medical system.
And that's why we were approached because they
wanted a community based organization
to provide Dell services.
So we're the second,
we're the first one that
does child first and
NFP, that's another evidence
based program that's, that works
together. So there's only two
>> and, and just to
tie things together
when the Navigators get
hired by
CYFD for, for
the car a program. This
would be one of the resources I would
think they would be
able to hook families
up with. That would be the
connection
Representative Chavez to
be followed by
Senator Representative
Ferrari.
>> Thank you Mr Chair.
So, um I actually
have a question for each
of the folk who are
here. Um
New Day. Um
I've been to your drop-in center
and I think it's a great place.
Um You said that you
get 20,000
from CYFD,
which doesn't seem like a lot.
Are you gonna be requesting
more
funding from
them?
>> Um So are
there, there isn't an
RFP or any funding
that's related to drop in
centers um that
we can actually apply
for, um our
original funding came from
Bernalillo County. Um
And that uh
that ceased to exist. And
so now City of Albuquerque
is our primary funder.
Um And so we're working
with our local city
council to see if we can
increase funding at the drop in center
in Albuquerque. We're in the
middle of that. >> So you don't
get funding from CYFD.
>> It's an educational grant,
I think it's $18,000
it's through next generation.
And so CYFD
is attached to it,
but it's primarily around our life
skills coaching. It really
doesn't have any um
attachment to the services
that we do for basic
needs like food
hygiene
showers.
Um It, it's, it's
completely separate and there's
not an offer for additional
funds that would expand
that. >> All
right. And then for both
um uh
yd I
and New Day, both of you
provide housing
for youth. So
do you have a waiting
list?
>> Uh We have four housing
programs that are related
to semi independent
and um
permanent supportive housing
and we have waiting lists for all of our
programs.
>> Um We do not have a waiting list
for our programs right now on
housing. >> Ok, thank
you. Um And then for
PB and J you said that in
2011,
um, the
program that
allowed you to work with,
um, parents who were
incarcerated
ended.
Um, and, and so
when did it start up
again?
>> Oh,
it started up again about a
year, I'd
say, um, almost a year
and a half ago. >> Ok. And do
you have a contract with CYFD
to do that work?
>> Yes, a small
portion of it. Yes. A
small
$60,000
is covered by.
>> And when did that
start >> this
year that started this
year? >> Ok. Thank you. Thank you,
Mr Chair.
>> Thank you, Representative
Representative Ferrari, followed
by Senator Sil
Lopez. >> Thank you, Mr
Chair. And
my question is
regarding YD
I and can
you tell me I tried
to see where you listed,
Donna County. Can
you tell me um what
programs are in
Dona
>> Antonian County? Unfortunately,
we have one programs, one of our
counties had the lease and that
one and just is expiring
where, what we were doing. We had
funding from the Kellogg Foundation
to work with the, the
immigrant population
to ensure that they
had training as they go
through the citizenships uh
process.
So, um that's
what we were doing in uh
in uh Dona Ana
now.
>> OK. And I
don't think you listed
that in any of the other programs,
did you? >> No, because it
was expiring
representative.
>> Ok.
Ok. So then, uh,
what your budget,
um,
money from
Las Cruces. Donna
County? Did you want to
extend it?
>> Um Yes, we,
yes, we're trying to work on extending
that right now.
But Donan, what we also have
on our road map is nurse family
partnership had taken that
is on our way to,
to, uh, to
Dona Ana County. That's probably one
of the next counties that's behind
Valencia. But,
um but there
was an effort
to extend it. We just couldn't find any
funding to do that work.
>> How about the federal government,
Mr Chair?
>> Yeah, we constantly review
all the federal funding
opportunities from the federal government
and for that specific program, we
didn't find any that fit
that specific
request.
>> And I'm talking about the immigrant
training. Yes,
and >> we didn't see
and we haven't been able to identify
any to keep that going. No, we have
not. >> Ok.
So, have you approached
the
county
on both of those programs?
>> No, we have not.
>> Ok. Do you want help doing
that? >> I love to
help doing that. I don't know
the, the commissioner. So,
absolutely. >> I know
a
few. Thank
you. That's all you get
with you afterward.
Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, Representative Senators
Lopez.
>> Thank
you.
Um You indicated that
Medicaid was not your
favorite funding source
and I can understand that.
Um But in addition
to that problem of how
difficult it is to deal with the paperwork
and everything. How do you serve
or do you serve individuals who are
not Medicaid eligible?
>> We do, um,
we have a contract with
the, with CD
YFD to be able to provide
those behavioral services to
nonmedicated
eligible individuals.
And, and let me explain the
reason why it's not a choice,
it's not really the paperwork,
you know, we, we experience our credentialing
and go through it. It's where it
puts the risk on the provider.
So I'm being asked, my
agency gets asked
to work with the hardest serve families,
right? And by
the way, the billing system is
set up, um I
take all the risks because if
they don't show up, I have staff,
I've hired, I have benefits. I have to
pay, I have rent all the
fixed costs. So if
I'm working with the highest
population that needs the
support, if they're not
showing up, then we have
the potential to run deficits
and programs which we don't have a lot
of restricted funds available
to make up those gaps. So
that's why it's really difficult. We
have to go through my board. We
worked on, we have a pretty
rigorous program and
sustainability. We
did it with our family partnership
because we had two or three years of
start up. We had E Ce D's
commitment to keep us going
as we were getting started
with most Medicaid programs.
We don't have that luxury
because, you know, we're
going to pay for the services based on what's
showing up. So that's why for
us, we try to, we're very
cautious because we just can't
risk
having
any type of deficits within
our programs. >> So
it would be better if instead
of fee for service, you got
a contracts,
>> it would be better if a grant
type funded. And cy
it was real, was real good this past
year. Um We needed open
crisis stabilization and most
of our other services are bed per
night ra or different ones.
But again, that population is real
hard. So we said that, you know, give
us a grant monitored by our
outcomes and what we're doing.
If we're not doing what we need to do,
then you can send the grant
to another provider or, and our
contract. So that took
the pressure off us worrying about
no shows which in a, a
high runaway
population that it,
it, it mattered, right? So
we did move, they were
open to, that was one of our most
recent contracts where we went to cost
reimbursement and more of the
monitoring based on outcomes
versus the unit
based per
night.
A >> absolutely.
And I should have started
by saying I admire the work
that each of your agencies
um do so much.
Um And thank you for, for
sharing it. Um II
I, the comment
I I wrote this down,
you need more money for evaluation.
It would be nice to get that.
Um How can we help
you? Because
that's the only way we can ensure
our families get better
and better services and the
agencies develop
better and better programs
is by that evaluation.
So how can we help you
make sure that you have the funds
necessary to evaluate
your programs and,
and build them
better Mr
Chair.
>> So I think that just
ensuring that we had funding to
support those, I think that's the
best way because I think once we had
the funding, we'd be able to do it.
It's just about that. It's, it's
very expensive
to fund theu. >> So
the suggestion would be when the state
give you contracts, they should
include
money.
That >> would be great.
>> Ok, thank you. I
appreciate that. >> And then
also a comment to that,
I think um
if you add the funding, when you look at a
three year contract or four year
contract amounts
predetermined, but the
cost to do the work increasing
when we want to our staff,
right. We do wage compensation
studies. We try to pay, we
pay 92% of
benefits to keep folks.
But when our contracts stay flat,
it's hard. Right. And we're having
to look within our budgets that
we go. So if there are
increases to departments, it would be
nice as a provider if
they would also increment
because inflation, all those
costs are there. But our contracts are
staying flat and that makes
it a challenge with all our
contracts. So any type
of that support would be greatly
appreciated.
>> Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Anybody else?
My question
of
now, I had a question for PB
and J um
and I, I'm
particularly
interested in the therapeutic
preschool.
You indicated
that it had stopped and you're trying
to restart it. Have you,
have you actually gotten it going
again or what's
the current status? >> Well, at
this time, we receive
money from the Bernon
County and so we're doing,
it's not the same,
the same version of it. It's a
smaller version.
And so, right, we
just were able to restart in
terms of it's their
parenting classes. So it's, you
receive a parenting class, the
kids receive a class and then
they meet together for a short
period of time. So
it's a little bit of a different model.
That's what, so what we've
done finally, since we're able to
have more in person things
now is we started
just a smaller group of people
to, to do so. One
day a week we're doing
that, we're practicing that
model and that just started within
this year. And >> have you talked to
CYFD about resuming
it and, and maybe getting a
contract with it because these are
the families.
I would think that, that they
are struggling with the
resource you provide would be
one that would be extremely
beneficial to those families
and to the department.
>> Right. And it was
funded by Medicaid
that was used Medicaid funding
before the environmental risk
funding was cut for
families. That's how
it was supported previous to
this. And so once
all the the funding regulations
changed is when we were
not able to sustain it.
>> I think, I think it's
worth going back to
Medicaid and CYFD now
because they,
we've gone through the cycles and,
and there was a period where
Medicaid was funding everything
and then they said, oh, no, you
can't do that. So they're funding
literally only
medical care and
now they're coming back and the cycle
is, is, is the
opportunities are broadening. I
think to get funding
for particularly
you indicated they were families
known to CYFD.
I'm assuming that means these
aren't kids in the CYF
DS custody. These are some of
the neglect,
possibly kids
that of cases that didn't
really get picked
up but could be
receiving services
to prevent them from ever
having referrals
in the future. >> It's for
both, for
both.
>> So I, I would hope you can get
that started again. Are you in your new
facility? >> We
know it's, it's
starting to be built right
now. >> How
will take >> another
at least another
year?
So they at least cleared the
ground so
far?
>> Very good. Any other, any
other questions? Yes,
representative. >> Thank
you, Mr Chair. I just have
one other question and for
y
for your behavioral health,
you provide behavioral health on an
outpatient basis as well. Is that
correct? We do.
So, do you guys have a waiting list
for
that?
>> We do have a slight waiting list
for that. Representative Chavis.
>> Yes. And so do
you, when you have a waiting
list, do you refer out to
other agencies
or? I
mean, I don't know how long your waiting
list is. We >> do we
do we make sure we refer
out, we try to make sure families
go, but we also keep them on our list
so we can follow up and, and
in case an opening comes up, we can
also serve them,
but we are making referrals
out. Ok. Thank
you. But the Behavioral
Medicaid is a small portion
of our business. That's one again, it's
one of those things that kind of, we're cautious
on how much staff we
hire because of them, the potentially
not showing up and so
>> forth. Ok,
thank >> you.
Well, thank you all. Thanks for
being uh such
effective partners
for CYFD,
uh and for
the youth and the families of this
community. Thanks so much.
So members that concludes
our, our um
agenda. I wanted
to go out of public
comment and we have several people
who signed up for
public comment.
Um I also
want to remind you because some of
you may need to start
thinking about lunch and so
on that. At two
o'clock in this room,
the office of the superintendent
of insurance will
be uh holding a town
hall on the issue
that we've raised
ourselves in the past and have
identified as something we're
concerned about. And
that is the,
the, um,
how, how to put it of
the issue of uh
uh
health care
hospitals and
clinics
becoming
um, subject
to takeovers
or mergers
with the large
equity firms and,
and, and, and
what the impact of that might be
on services
with the idea that maybe
we should be fostering
some kind of greater state o
oversight
of that of that activity.
And so she's gonna have that hearing
here in this room and we're all
invited if you can
stay. Uh,
so here's who we have on our
schedule. I've got
um, Sam
Wolf with fall falling
colors
and he'll, he'll
be followed by Alison
Endicott Quinones
with advocacy
Inc
>> Good afternoon,
Mr chairman, madam, chair
committee members. Thank you very
much. My name is Sam
Wolf. I'm born and
raised in Rio, Riba County,
Tiara, Maria and El Rito.
I'm currently the
chief operating officer
and general counsel for falling
Colors Corporation
Falling colors is
serves the state in a couple of
different ways. One, we are the
data partner on the Kevin
project helping to deliver
that verified data that was
discussed today,
helping the state to develop,
develop those metrics
that show unfortunately, as
we all know less progress than
we wish towards those metrics,
but actually demonstrating what's
really happening so that this committee
and everybody else involved can
see where we're going.
Our other capacity is
as the administrative Services
Organization for the,
the Interagency
Behavioral Health Care purchasing
collaborative. That
means that we work with
CYFD BHS, the other
agencies to help
to deliver funds to
the providers. We were
brought in in that capacity in
2017 after the
shake up and the Arizona
debacle, there were only
about 100 providers in the
entire network statewide. At
that point. Over the past
seven years, we've grown that to
over 608 100
if we count individual schools
that we contract with,
including the three excellent
agencies that were just up
here just now.
Um In that capacity,
I want to make a brief
clarification to some of the
statements that I heard yesterday
and an invitation
we provide, we
are a pass through agency that
means that money doesn't go to
falling colors. It goes through
us out to all of those agencies.
We are able to contract
with those agencies and
to develop data based
on where that money is going,
we can show where that's going.
So a number of people made comments
about wanting to know where's
the money going. Where is the hard
data, how we see this?
That is data that we collect.
So when a statement is made,
that money may be moved out of the
falling colors contract,
that doesn't mean it's not going to
us. That means it's no longer
available to those 800
providers around the state that
are delivering behavioral health care
services. Of course, it
may be being moved into another
program or something that we don't have
oversight of that we don't participate
in. But I do want to be clear
that money is not going to
us. It's going through us to
all of those 800
providers including the
three that were just up here.
Another area that
I want to just clarify
is decisions about
allocation. So we do not
ever make a decision about
where funding should be allocated
to. We participate
in the process of moving that so
that a certain age, certain
provider might be
allocated $50,000
for a particular project. We make
sure that they can't bill over that.
We make sure that their billing
is tied to the
rules around that
allocation. Um But
we don't make that decision. What we
do do and what we can make
available is data
about how those programs
are being funded and utilized.
So if two programs are
each allocated a million dollars,
we can show halfway through the
year that one of those
programs is going to be out of money
by April 1st, we can
show that the other one given
current spending is going to
have a reversion of 30%
of their funds. We make that
available to the agency
leadership so that they can make
those decisions, see
how they should make, how they should
reallocate that
I would be honored to
meet with anybody on this committee.
Anybody else, you know, who thinks that
this data might be interesting,
show you a demonstration of our
system, show you the kind of
data that we have a
number of you made comments about
wanting to see it. I'll stick
around for a while. We can
show you a lot of that
information. We can answer a
lot of the questions that were raised
today with hard data.
Thank you all very much for your
time.
>> I think, I think we would
be very interested in having a
presentation on
what's happening with behavioral
health funding and, and,
and uh
sharing the data that
we >> would be absolutely
delighted to make a
special meeting for anybody
on this committee, >> we
will be meeting in
Portelli in
August
31st.
So if you could make it to
Portell, that would be a great
opportunity. >> We can make that >> happen.
We'll have Mr
Da work with
you on that. >> Ok.
Thank you very much, Mr Chairman
members.
>> Then we have
Allison
Endicott Quinones who
had spoken yesterday
but had more to say
and, and we've invited her back
to say it again or to say
different things again
or to say better things,
whatever.
>> See,
thank you, chair and members of the committee.
I appreciate your time. I know it's
very limited. Um I
do have lots of things
to say pages, but I'm going
to cut to the
chase, which we've
heard a lot about
what do we do? How do we fix
all of these problems? How do we
even pare out what all the
problems are? And I think
that the one biggest
key is
removing the
confidentiality and the
sequestration of our
cases so that
all of you can see
what the problems are in our
system. You cannot
fix something you can't
see right now.
Our system is mirroring
the dysfunction and neglect that
we're supposed
to be fixing, but we're
not doing that and none
of you and the public
do not know what all
those pieces are
that are failing. And the only
way to do that is to
open up Cyf D's
data and
also the courts.
Um I know that Representative
Marian Matthews
had, uh, it
was in, in 23
she had HB 10,
which was supposed to change the
confidentiality statute
for CYFD
in order to make significantly
more information
available that
build. While wonderful,
did not go far enough
because the problems, while
we can easily target
CYFD, I have
pages of all the issues
there. You
can't, there's also
other factors. We've got the
behavioral health piece
and we have what's going on in the
courtrooms. Additionally,
we don't have eyes
on to ensure that
all of us who
are participating in this
process, who are part of the
system are held
accountable. The thing
that, that opening
up these cases, opening
up system can
do is not
only make you
all aware of all the problems
that need to be addressed so that
they can be addressed,
but also raising
our all of our
practice. So that
because we are being
watched, people
who are watched, behave
well, relative
to those who have the
shroud
of,
of, of that,
of the, the
sort of the veil that
covers our system
using that sequestration
and the lack of
confidentiality.
So 32 a
433 is
the the disclosure
slash confidentiality statute
that needs to be reworked.
So that the only thing that's
not available
is what is what you see
under HIAA as
being the personal
protected health
information, the
the identifier information.
So no, no names
or security numbers, those,
those types of, of
identifiers. But
all the rest of the information
needs to be available. And
then under 32 A
for 20
that involves the courts.
Right now, there is a
provision that allows the
media to attend
court hearings.
However, the courts
do not like that. And as
a result, they are,
they use
that to,
they narrow it so
much that it is
nearly impossible for
the for the media to
actually report
anything and put so many
restrictions on it. Additionally,
there needs to be ahead
of time and much like
you're going to see with the issue raised
by the cabinet secretary.
Sure, you can go to
CYFD, you can do a
walkthrough and it is a
dog and pony show or a
horse and pony show, whatever the phrase
is, they
create what they
want you to see and when
the court has the same
opportunity to, to
have, if someone's coming in,
they too can do what
they need to show in
order to show that things are
going the way they are. They
would like it to be
perceived
confidentiality.
As you know, there's a famous
Louis BRANDEIS quote
regarding
Sunshine being the best
disinfectant, we need
to disinfect our system
and to do that, we need light
shining on it. I have
all kinds of other stuff. I'd love to
share. Can't do it
now. But um because
I'm sure I'm out of time, but
thank you very much. >> Are,
are you on the
Senate Memorial
Five Commission.
>> I am not, I am
on the children's code
revision task force,
but I am not >> on that. And
are they taking up the confidentiality
issue? >> They are not. They decided
that because a bill had
been, that HB 10
had been, had
been offered and would probably
be in some form offered
again. They decided not to approach
or deal with that subject.
Which is really
unfortunate
>> is, is your
commission
>> um Mr Mr
Chair and we
have had some
talk about it on the task force
for the children's code,
but because of funding,
um we're kind of cut at this
point to end this month of
June, but I've been looking
for some additional funding to see
how we could at least extend it
through November so that
we have maybe some more time to take
up a few of these issues um
to discuss it. So,
stay
tuned.
>> Thank you very much,
Alison. >> Thank you very
much uh chair
and, and all of the committee
and is is it
possible for me to just give you
one quick example of some of
the failures of our, of
CYFD itself? What's going
on with the shortcomings of
our um
of our uh the
lack of, of
employees, the lack of
staffing. I have a
shortlist. Um
I just wanted to let
you know. So right
now, the statement that
we are up to up to
speed or even
close. That was
represented by the cabinet
Secretary is not correct.
So we have overloaded
individuals as
retention is really
low retaliation
against those who speak out is
high. There's a lack of
support and knowledge,
institutional knowledge is all
gone. There's forced
overtime. They're neglecting
their own families. These workers
are another reason they leave.
They're permanency is
delayed for these kids because
they, their reports aren't done.
Hearings are delayed.
There's not
no one showing up for
court CCAS or their
client, the
workers.
And then as an example,
with regards to the things that don't
get done, I have one case
where she hasn't, her
dental, her dental
situation was such that not only
her teeth rotted, but it went all the
way up into her skull
and her adult teeth
over a year, she still
hasn't gotten her dental surgery.
They haven't. She also is
involved in a criminal case
and see why failed to transport
her to all the appointments for
the das office as a victim
witness. They failed to get
her into therapy for a year and she
ended up in UN M
psych hospital. They failed
to transport her to school
repeatedly. So she would miss
weeks at a time. The
Children don't, she doesn't get
visited in the whole monthly
as required by law. And that
happens in most of my cases.
There's not also
not documenting the
disclosures of sexual abuse
that she made after
she came into custody for
neglect. So none
of those are being documented or
investigated. Nothing
is being cross reported
either. And,
and one other piece is that not
as it pertains to her, but
in general, they're not reporting
missing Children. Those are
just some of the examples of what
we're seeing. Our system is
failing and we need your help.
Thank you very
much.
>> Thank you. Now, there
are several people that may
be on
Zoom
and I'm gonna read your name
out and if you want to
say anything, make
public comment on Zoom.
Here's your opportunity.
If not, we'll just go to the
next name because we're not
clear exactly who wants
to speak. But
Melina Archuleta from
UN M Health
Sciences.
Are you
there?
Good. Did you want to say something in
public
comment?
Thank you. That your time is
up.
Thank you very much,
Miss
Melina Archuleta,
Melissa Beri. You're
next. Do you want
to say
anything?
Are you still there? Um
Melissa,
we'll go on then to
Laly Violante
with New Mexico.
Can
OK. Thank you. Violent.
Uh How about Monica
Mu Muda
policy advocate at
NMK or I'm I'm
not sure where but policy
advocate.
OK,
>> thank
you.
Your, your time is
up.
>> So,
Monica, thank you very much.
The um um
the issue you're bringing up is
one that I hope Cyfd is
taking notes on and possibly
one we might want to hear
more about in the future, but
we'll wait to see what the behavioral
health um uh
purchasing collaborative
decides to do about that
too. So, thank you for
bringing it to our attention.
Finally, we have
Marlene
Lira.
Thank you very much
Marlena and I'm sure
Representative Ferrari is going to
make sure we, we
deal with the issue of uh
increased alcohol taxation
in this committee and in
the uh Revenue
Stabilization and Tax Policy
Committee. And
as will Senator
Cil Lopez,
uh we have one other name
on the list uh
Tenneco or Tanika
Sosa
Gonzalez.
Mm
Thank you for pointing out the
inadequacy of our
technology.
Yeah,
too late to do anything about it
today, but it's
good. But
Inga in last and where are we
going next? Tafts in Tafts? I'm
sure we'll have great
technology.
Um
With that.
Uh Just a reminder that
the superintendent of insurance
will be holding that hearing here
and at two o'clock,
uh so if you want to grab a bite
and come back for that, that's a
possibility. Uh
We, we had also said we
might spend a little bit of time
talking about
what to do about CYFD,
but I frankly,
I, I, I'd rather mull it
over in my head, but if you want
to say something about it now, or
somebody has some brilliant
ideas. Representative
Chasey, you have a brilliant
idea.
Um Just
>> thank you, Mr Chairman.
I, I don't have a brilliant
idea, but I had
so many questions of
the um the
Kevin uh panel.
I'm wondering if I could submit
them and maybe
if others had
questions or
suggestions,
then maybe we could
share those among
um committee members
and unfortunately I,
because I had to meet with the speaker,
I, I missed a couple of
comments and I heard Senator Sel
Lopez made a really good one.
And so,
um, I, I
just would appreciate
that just because I had some
specific questions
about the settlement
and what it means for
the Children or
the future.
So,
>> ok, and, and keep in mind
we are gonna have the,
whatever they're called, the co
equal, co
neutrals, not the
co I think
she said co mingled at one point,
but I think she said co
neutrals, uh come
back, we're gonna try to get them to,
to, to come give us
a presentation again.
But in the meantime, if you have
questions, I would suggest
we all send our questions
to Xander
who will, who will then,
uh you know, put them together and get
them out to us so
we can have a
more a
fuller
discussion of it. Did you
want to come in?
>> Thank you, Mr
Chair. I mean, I'm
sure that I share the frustration
of many in this room
and, you know, it feels
like,
you know, we're doing what we've
been doing again. I mean,
since I came
in what
year? I
don't remember.
Um, but
it's, we're, we're hearing the same
information and the same
problems and the same issues.
And so I
guess in my mind
really thinking
about
how do we approach
this in terms
of
bringing in
folks who
really have the skill
to manage this agency, the
experience.
Um And
really thinking about do we
need to move it out? You
know, as your bill proposed,
move it out from under the
governor because it
really, every time there's
a governor, we see
new
ideas and new
reorganization, but it doesn't
fix anything. We're
doing the same thing constantly over
and over again. Um
And I think that the progress
that was
made under the dissent
decree,
um
once the department was
out from under that consent
decree,
um
once there wasn't a court order
anymore, everything just
went to hell.
So, and, and
it's harming kids
and we're back to
harming kids again. And do we want to
keep doing that?
>> Um
>> Well, um Mr
Chair, not on that specifically,
but what occurred to me is one of
the, one
of the facts that was
discussed
is that CYFD
and I think it might have related
to Children staying in the
offices and
recruiting a certain
uh cadre of
foster parents who are
willing to take
people,
you know, on a temporary basis, the
older students, but
then they got their funding cut. So
I'm thinking we also
have questions. Does LFC
know this because
they don't want to be cutting those
things that
they would actually make
some
improvement
>> that I, I think that's a
really good question, Mr
Chair. I, I
do know that there
is sort of this
subcomittee
of child welfare
or Cyfd I can't remember
the exact name of it right
now and, and of, of
LFC. And so we
probably should figure out
who they are and what they're
doing.
>> It's a,
they,
they're meeting
Tuesday,
Tuesday in Carlsbad, the
Child welfare sub-committee,
but they meet for like an hour and a
half. I mean, their, their
sub-committee will meet for an hour and a
half. Yeah.
Yeah. Uh,
Senator,
>> thank you, Mr Chair in
addition to supporting those
really great ideas.
Um I think it would be
good when we have the co
neutrals to
ask the director
to come because
in looking through this report, the,
the secretary, yes, the
secretary to come and, and
speak to us and to
bring
because they have
verified data and
they show in each,
in each step
where,
where the agency fell short
and where it met its goals
and it met its goals in a lot of
planning and in a lot
of, uh you know, a lot of
the things where it met its goals was kind
of putting things in place,
but then the execution
isn't there yet.
And so it would be good. I,
and I apologize, I wasn't
here for the, for the
secretary's
presentation, but
that would give us a sense,
a better sense of where we
are with,
with this because
um it, it's very, very
long and, and I actually
think that if, if I were the
secretary, I would actually make a chart
and say these are the,
these are the objectives
and this is what we've accomplished and
this is what we still need to accomplish.
And this is the plan
for accomplishing
it. I mean,
I'm, I'm throwing out that suggestion
because it will give us a better handle
of where to put our focus
in and where money needs,
whether it's money or
policy or whatever
needs to be
developed to,
to meet the
requirements.
It's I'm not saying that's a brilliant
idea, but it would help me
understand this better. Thank
you
>> of having
the inviting the
secretary to be there when the co
neutrals meet with us.
I think we're talking
about Rio Rancho was that we were
talking about,
we could do, we could do that the co
neutrals as soon as portal.
Oh, ok. If
they're available
so we could meet with them in
portales and then
if they're not available, then
we'll try it at one of the later
meetings,
representative,
>> you know, as the chair
on.
Um I was really
taken by a statement
that the secretary made
yesterday.
Uh kind of got me
thinking,
but
it was kind of not necessarily
a statement made out of
desperation,
but more out of kind of
a collaboration
I think.
And then, and the secretary
basically said,
um
kind of seeking from
our the committee,
how they can
bring
more
foster families on
board.
And so that
these meter believe
that the
department has no
system
in terms of identifying
or even recruiting
foster families.
And, uh,
I had a AAA
model
foster family in my
district.
They both
are
Uh, and
I think the department could have
learned from
them,
uh, in terms of kind of
profiling,
uh, their
case
because what they did,
they were an older
couple, they
started fostering,
uh, in their fifties
and sixties
and went into their
seventies
and they would
take,
and, um,
uh,
they would take kind of
the,
the, the
worst of the
worst.
They take a,
a, a,
um,
twins
that were physically
abused
as infants.
The parents placed
them on the stove
burner.
So their buttocks
were kind of,
uh,
harmed.
Um,
these are the kids that this
couple take
would take, they would
take us to
foster.
They took a child that
had spinal
bifida
and they ended up adopting
her as one of their
own and they had five kids
of their own.
They took a k, a child
that had, um, alcohol
fetal syndrome
and, uh,
and all, and all those
complications that come
with that in terms of
growing.
And, uh,
they took a child,
they took Children
basically
infants,
five years of
age that were
sexually
abused.
In fact, uh,
when they brought this young
girl into their
home,
apparently a trigger
that brought about the abuse
was when daddy would
ask her to sit on her
lap.
So when Mr
Montoya,
um
because of a uh
because
of a situation
where he was trying to kind
of
of
create a pattern
of love and
respect.
Uh for the first time
when that child sat on Mr
Montoya's lap,
that was, that was
the trigger for
her to go
into the
sexual
scenario with
the dad.
So the child started
kind of
of um
reaching out to Mr Montoya
in a real sexual
way and
that brought up that brought
about that.
No, this is not
good. You're
not gonna do this,
you know. And,
um, you know, and
Mr Chair, I, I
think there's a lot of people
out there like
Mr and Mrs Montoya,
but the thing is that the department
has no, has no
process in
which to identify these
people and bring them into
the loop. And I think
that the department needs to reach
out to the church
communities,
kind of a rural
families
that have different settings
in terms of,
of uh
traditions with
agrarian
cultures,
you know, where Children can kind of
appreciate
a different setting than what
they've been used to, especially
when it comes to the Children that
are, have been physically
and sexually abused.
But that kind of really makes me
wonder that
I think we're leaving out a lot of
people
that can be foster parents,
but we have
no mec mechanism
to basically bring them into
the loop. And
I think by kind of
creating profiles
of families
that have proven to
be model
foster parents
and how is it that they
became to be that?
I think that's what we want to
learn and,
and, and, and, and, and make
that like the template
in which we kind of reach out to
the public.
So I don't know
that that
really kind of makes me
wonder Mr Chair
that maybe the
department
uh in terms
of being all encompassing
in terms of how to
define
um future
foster parenting and
foster
parents.
>> Good points.
And then Representative Thompson,
you have another
issue. >> I do
thank you, Mr Chair.
But in terms of the
subcommittee's been brought
up over and over, that would
have had to be in our work
plan and it would have been
approved by a
legislative council
and this, this committee
previously had a behavioral
health subcomittee and the
developmental disabilities
subcommittee's. No
one showed
up to those if
we didn't just weave them into
our regular. So,
um it sounds like a great idea,
but I'm just wondering how many
people really want to sit
on a or can
even sit on another committee.
But, and then another
thing is I'm disappointed that
our LFC staff are
not here. This is the part
they need to be here for
if the if or
maybe they are.
But I would like, I
would like all of
them to
uh to stick around and
to hear what we do and to hear
what we're thinking and,
and I know you don't belong
to this, although
someone in leadership told
me just act like they belong
to us. So that's what I'm
doing. But I want to request
that, that they,
they stick around for the whole
time and, and
if we have questions and things like
that and then Mr Chair, the other
issue is the
um Sandoval
Regional Medical Center.
Um I have met
with multiple
types of providers from
their um physical
therapist, nurses,
uh radiology
folks all and they
are, they are panicked
as we've heard.
Um, they, they
got rated, um
with the lowest possible
grade by, I believe it
was C MS.
Um and
they're, they're, they're now
in negotiations
>> and they, the,
the
management doesn't
seem to want to negotiate
with the folks that they're
paying them way too little. They're
having them do things that are
considered unsafe by
the national boards of
those. Like in
radiology, you're not supposed
to do certain procedures
without a second person
and they just have to
do it because there's no second
person. And
so, um, what I'm
>> recommending is that we hear
from them >> and that
we also send one of our
famous strongly
worded letters to
the administration at
the hospital and tell
them that we,
we hear what, what's
going on and we'd like
to like to
have you go to the
bargaining table
with good faith
and we, you know, we may have
to have you come in
and talk to us and tell us why
things are so bad out there.
So thank you Mr Chair.
So, >> so you are you moving
that we do the letter? >> I
am.
>> Um the only thing
is that the, the
letter, the sample
letter and I think
everybody get a copy.
>> No, the
sample letter is a bit
too.
Um It's
got claims in there that we can't
necessarily.
Yeah. So, so what we're
gonna, what I'm gonna ask
Xander to do is to,
is to make a legislative,
let you know our strongly worded
letters that we do. Um
And you know, maybe use this
letter and I did make
copies for folks, but when I looked
at it, it's like, mm
I don't think this should come from
us but, but so that's
where that is. So I'm making a
motion.
>> Ok. Uh Let's see, uh
Chasey Kates and
Chavez,
>> I'll be on another
topic right after this
motion,
>> Kate.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and thank you,
vice chair. Yeah, I do
agree on the
rewriting of the letter. I
strongly support
this letter.
I will say that
this communication has been
going on since 2022.
The governor
has
indicated
it. They have
lost 18
lawsuits. The hospital
has against the
providers
and they are
in the hole
financially
maybe due
to their very
expensive legal bill. I'm
not sure, but
I am asking
the
committee to not
just address
this letter to the
CEO, which we've been doing
since 2022.
But UN M Regents
needs to be who
is now overseeing
the hospital since
January of this year.
The regents
are supposed to be making
these decisions
and this letter will need
to go to them as
well.
>> Mm
Yeah. >> So I, I have a
question. So,
so there are two bargaining
units at Sandoval Regional.
So I think what we should
do, I'm assuming
that they're giving
both bargaining units
the same kind of difficulty in
negotiations. So I
would request that we
include both of the bargaining
units. I can.
Yeah, I can.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And I think the other piece too
is that UN
M is notorious
for dragging
their feet and
going to court
no matter who's
organizing
at UN M.
So I just wanted to
say
that
>> you
and thank you, Mr Chair
and Representative Kates. If you could send
me all the people
that you all
want to this sent
to so I can have that list as
>> well.
Oh, ok. Thank
you.
>> We are scheduled to meet
in Rio Rancho and one
we were trying to decide
which, which
local to
which venue to, to
choose and Sandoval
regional could be one.
And that might be interesting.
Uh Also the,
um, what's the
Presbyterian Russ,
Russ? And also,
then both the UN M
branch and
CNM Branch have offered
to host us there. So
that's a decision
that
you might want to weigh in on at some
point. We, we don't have to
make that decision yet. That's
in
November. So
we got a couple of months but, but
that would be an interesting op
option to meet there.
Representative Chasey.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. I just
having looked at some
presentations with
Representative Kates that you had
earlier this week
and some
folks noting that our
LFC staff or
this committee were
not present
today or all of
yesterday. >> They
were, they were here, they
just left before public
comment, >> but
apparently they were not
here all day
yesterday. According to
Representative
Jones,
I, I guess I just wanted
to ask if
perhaps directors
or, um,
deputy director,
um Courtney
would, if this
committee would say how important it
is for them
because we had some data
apparently from
CYFD that
came from LFC.
That didn't make
sense. And I've
always relied
on LFC
on their analysis
from >> CYFD was because
we have nothing to look at.
We had a verbal
presentation that
rattled up numbers and
things
that
>> thank you,
>> Mr Chair. I'm sorry. I know we
weren't but I got several
things. One is, is
we had a presentation
by LFC that
made conclusions
such as alcohol
and drugs are the highest
risk factor when
there was no data for domestic
violence. Now,
why wouldn't they say there's no
data for domestic
violence? Because
and why
wouldn't we not have the
LFC analyze
these numbers instead of
me that would
say we
are
decreasing?
Our, we have open
these many FTEs,
we have all this
workforce that hasn't been
done, but yet we're down to 10
cases. So
I did go to,
to Cyft and
ask them and they said, oh no, our
slide says 10 new
cases this
month. I I'm
just saying that that's OK. People
make mistakes,
but I am
concerned that the LFC
is not finding them
and putting them in part
of their presentation
like we don't know why there's
10. So
that would be my concern.
I also, we,
we talked about earlier and I
know we went to a different subject
matter about,
about the co
neutrals. I think
that
here's the thing. We've got data in a
lot of different places. I'd love
to have a white board
up where we're, we're
asking questions
to figure out what it is
we can do to
help our
Children in New Mexico.
And one is, that's
wonderful. We have co neutrals.
Do any of them live in New
Mexico?
I know that some of them weren't able
to make a zoom meeting because
east coast time was not
good for them.
For us.
>> We shouldn't have those co
neutrals. We have those
co neutrals. They are our co
neutrals. We pay
them, they're available
to us. Are you saying we shouldn't
use them
because they're not from New
Mexico?
I mean it, I'm sorry
to, to, you've made the
same 0.3 times,
you made it on Wednesday,
you made it on Thursday and you made it again
today that the LFC
data is flood. I'm
not sure why repeating it another
time is going to help representative
and, and the thing about the co
neutrals, if they're, if they're
available, like
the guy from uh uh Annie
B Casey, any E
Casey, let's use
them. I mean, the, there's no reason
not to say let's use them.
We've already paid
them
the >> No
II I, I'm OK
with that chair. I believe that
that also helps with.
Maybe that's what makes them
neutral.
>> Well, but I think the reason they're
selected is because they've, they've done
this in other states,
they've resolved, they've made
great progress in other states.
Can we learn from them
or do we have to find
somebody living in New Mexico who
has done it in another
state?
>> I just wanted to clarify what
we said about LFC not
being here yesterday, I
did have questions
when Cyfd was presenting
that I would have liked to ask them, but
I didn't see them there and
I never saw them again. So
that, that was my experience,
maybe they were here somewhere and I just
didn't see them. >> So
LFC has been here every
day >> yesterday
afternoon. I didn't see them. That's
all that's and I, I
had questions
so
it might have been
>> just >> rely on
any opposition to the motion
of sending a strongly
worded letter to
the regents
administration of U and
M
close the park >> in
you.
I, I'm not opposed to it. I'd
like to see it before it goes out
though just
to make sure everything's
correct.
Yeah, that wasn't my
intention.
I don't want to delay
it
>> with that.
I think we've, we're ready
to adjourn any other
issues. >> Thank
you, Mr Chairman. I just want to say
thank you. I know it's difficult. There's
so much stress, long days
and uh you run a good
meeting and, and I just
want to thank you for that and thank all the
members too, for your ideas
and your comments and all it's
we have to stay together
here, big issues. Thank
you, Mr Chairman. >> Yes. And
thank you all for your
patience with us
and with that, we'll call the
meeting to adjourn
the meeting and
