Uh, guests in the audience and
presenters. Let's go ahead and
our 3rd day, our final day of
our Indian Affairs Committee
meeting.
And we will reconvene.
Immediately with agenda item
number 14.
Which is legislation endorsement
committee discussion.
You'll have to pardon me. I have
to excuse myself from 0.
A.m. to 10:30.
So with that, who do we have
first redistricting, please come
forward.
Introduce yourselves and you may
begin.
Thank you, madam chair. Thank
you committee.
I am not representative of the
House District 30.
OK
Yeah,
see you later.
I see.
I
The executive director for the
Human Rights Commission.
Not want to wait a minute so
things can be distributed, or
should I just begin?
All right.
Um, this
to you and you all should have
in front of you, uh, for your
consideration for endorsement, a
joint resolution to put before
the voters of New Mexico, the
option to create an independent
redistricting committee.
In the last redistricting cycle,
New Mexico in 2021, created the
citizens redistricting
Committee.
Which is commonly called the
CRC.
And that was a huge step forward
for New Mexico.
Um, but it wasn't complete. The
statute was incomplete because
there was not time to get the
constitutional amendment done
that would allow it to be truly
independent.
That's why we're bringing this
proposal forward to finish the
job.
New Mexicans deserve fair and
transparent redistricting.
Um, and that's why we continue
to bring this forward.
The letter of support would give
you an idea of the breadth of
support across New Mexico for
this initiative.
And to be absolutely clear.
There is no proposal.
For independent redistricting
that will remove all of politics
from the process. It's just part
of the process.
But this does address the
inherent
Conflict of legislators drawing
their own districts.
As you've often heard, voters
should choose their legislators,
not the other way around.
So, right now?
Um, the 2025 session is the
midway point.
We have 5 years before our next
census and our next
redistricting process.
A constitutional amendment needs
time to go before the voters.
And then we need additional time
to create the enabling
legislation to make it work.
So now is the time to address
the issue, so that we are not
facing the pressure we did in
our last redistricting cycle to
get everything done in time.
Um, if you look at the
resolution.
I'll take you through it briefly
and then Mr. Gorman will have a
few words about the broader
picture.
Section one, the change is the
deletion of, uh
Part D
And then the new language is
section 2.
And section 2A addresses the
composition and the selection of
the commission. RCRC is 7.
This proposal increases the
commission to 9, to better
reflect the diversity in
geographic distribution of our
state.
It's also proposes a hybrid
selection process.
The 1st 6 of the 9 would be
selected randomly with a
weighted statistical method.
Again, to reach the diversity
and geographic distribution we
need for New Mexico.
And then just to ensure the
diversity of that commission,
those 6 would select the final 3
from the applicant pool.
The enabling legislation.
is where we will lay out the
prohibitions on who can serve
and who cannot.
This original proposal was 12
pages. We cannot add 12 pages to
the Constitution. So this is
short, direct, lays out the
guidelines and the enabling
legislation will fill in the
blanks.
Section B lays out the
parameters, the guidelines for
um
Section B is more of the
selection and composition,
Section C lays out the
guidelines and the principles
that we use. These are the same
principles that our current CRC
uses. This just
Codifies it in the Constitution.
And section D gives the
commission legal standing, they
need to defend their maps in
court, should there be
challenges.
And with that,
I would like to allow Mr. Gorman
to address the committee.
Madam Chair and members of the
Indian affairs and Committee.
Go there.
I want to talk about the
Areas of
Recommendations that the Navajo
Nation has had in the past.
And also um our participation in
the redistricting activities in
the past couple of cycles.
My, my office the nomination
Human Rights Commission.
Has been assigned in the past to
Represent the Navajo Nation on
redistricting activities. We
went through two cycles, 2011
and 2021.
And we have participated
intimately.
In the Utah, Arizona, and New
Mexico redistricting activities.
And for the new state of New
Mexico, we've also been a party
to the
Senate Bill 30 304.
In the past, I believe it was in
the.
2021 session.
That created the
Citizen redistricting
commission.
And then uh in 2022, I believe
it was the House Bill 4.
And also created the Voting
Rights Act.
And enshrined the Native
American Voting Rights Act.
Uh, in the state of New Mexico.
These are very, um,
Advance ways to protect uh
Native American voting rights.
And you as a committee have made
these recommendations.
And been a party to the passes
of these bills.
And my office has been a party
to the
Redistributing task force that
was established in 2020 and has
offered recommendations. There
was a report submitted.
Uh, to the New Mexico
legislature.
And if I recall correctly,
recommendation 6 was to
establish an independent
Uh, redistricting commission has
made uh by the redistricting
commission.
And you've
Incorporated many of those
recommendations into the passage
of the previous bills.
So
We have found that as the body
that deals with redistriting,
um, there is a need for the
creation of the independent
redistricting commission as
based on of our experience from
the Arizona side of the Navajo
Nation.
Arizona side of the Navajo
Nation is slightly larger than
the New Mexico side.
Uh, and where they have the
independent redistricting
commission.
Established in 2000.
And yes, um, politics will never
be removed from all of these
activities and politics has been
a part of the independent
redistricting commission
activities in Arizona, including
all the way up to the US Supreme
Court when appeals were uh
Submitted uh to the court system
and the establishment of the
independent redistricting
commission.
But nonetheless, Navajo Nation
has had the opportunity to
recommend to this body.
Uh, and then New Mexico
legislature by resolution in
ABID 623 back in December.
The need to protect the voting
rights of the Navajo voters.
At the county state level, and
this was in reference to the XB
4 and the implementation
thereafter.
It also referenced the need to
protect the voting rights of the
Navajo people when considering
the redistricting uh principles
and the establishment of the
independent redistricting
commission.
Likewise, my commission also
passed a resolution in January
of 2024 supporting the need for
establishment of the independent
redistricting commission.
At the moment, my office is
working with the uh Navajo
legislature, uh, the New Mexico
caucus to incorporate additional
uh information and wording to
continue with the
Support for the establishment of
the independent redistricting
commission.
I remember reading Professor
Sanchez's report after the uh
2021 redistricting activities.
In his report, he referenced
that based on his survey across
the state.
70
percent of the respondents
support the establishment of the
Independent redistricting
commission.
And we were, my office in Nanajo
Nation was intimately involved
in, in our conversations with
Professor Sanchez and when he
was drafting the report. And
thank you very much and we seek
your support for this particular
measure.
Yeah
Madam Chair.
Who takes over?
Thank you. OK, madam chair.
I appreciate that. 22 other
things of note that I would
point out on page 2, line 21.
This is different than the
proposal that was brought forth
in the last session in that it
does not apply to congressional
districts, federal congressional
districts. This applies to state
legislative districts and other
districts within the state like
the public education.
Mission districts. Those are
what is addressed by this
independent redistricting
commission in this proposal.
Um, I wanted to make sure you
caught that difference as you're
skimming through this bill.
The other thing that I believe
is, is very important on page 3
lines 19 and 20, but really,
page 3, all of section C.
These are the redistricting
principles of the Voting Rights
Act of our Native American
Voting Rights Act and the key
shall not result in minority
vote dilution would now be
codified in our Constitution.
Um, and with that, Madam Chair,
I think we'll stand for
questions and get to it.
Representative Blanc.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I feel
like it's deja vu because uh
we're in the same committee and
we're gonna miss you because
you're going over to the Senate,
but Madam Chairman, I just had a
few, a few questions, and I
guess not really coming from a
place of
Like total nonunderstanding, but
just.
to get it on the record to
affirm your intent, I suppose.
So, Madam Chair, I guess just
starting on page 3.
I believe.
Going to line.
Um
Let's go line 11 to 14. We're
talking about how the Secretary
of State shall administer the
process. So, Madam Chair, and I
was gonna call you Senator
Representative. I'm wondering,
sorry, Madam Chair. I, I hope
I'm not predicting the future.
Maybe I am, you never know. But
I'm wondering, uh, Madam Chair.
How will this be administered
randomly.
Like, I, I guess enabling
legislation would need to be put
into place, but I just want to
make sure the names that are
being put in, I don't know if
we're doing it in a hat or a
lottery or some kind of
Way that we're randomly choosing
it. How does the public
independently verify that it is
indeed being done in a random
and fair way, Madam Chairman.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
Representative, you are
absolutely correct. That will be
in the enabling legislation. If
you want to look at what
We were proposing, um,
Look at how Joint Resolution 10
from the last session that lays
it out in detail, but that
enabling legislation, battle
will have to be.
Done in our house and our Senate
here in the legislature to firm
it out. The intent is that the
Secretary of State's office
would send out applications.
Running numbers, it looks to be
about 0.4% of our voters because
we want electors.
In this set, they will qualify
their geographic location, their
voting address that they are
certified, um, voters and then
narrow it down to a pool of
about 120 evenly split between
the two major parties and then
not the two major parties.
And statistically weighted
terminology refers to waiting
for geographic distribution and
ethnic diversity.
So all of that would be in the
pool, and then the random
selection would take place in a
public forum. That is not new.
It is already done by our
Secretary of State's office for
several of their processes. So
live streaming public process
random selection.
Great. Thank you so much, Madam
Chair, and uh that, that clears
it up a little bit. I appreciate
that. I just wanted to make sure
that we were all super clear
that that's the intent, right?
We want that. And I think that's
good that we clarified that we
both agree on that. So, I know
that there's some, I would say,
vague language, but it's a
constitutional amendment. So we
can't be like super specific
like on the, the X of January
we're gonna do X and on this
date we're gonna do that. We
don't want the ballot to be 100
pages, even though I would
totally be OK with that, but
You know,
I like to read things, I
suppose. So, Madam Chair, I know
we say like traditional
redistricting principles
sufficiently large, uh, minority
group.
geographically compact. I know
these are quite
Normal terms, but I don't see
anywhere here specifically
talking about communities of
interest.
In that verbage, I mean, maybe
it's somewhere else, uh,
enabling legislation, but I'm
wondering communities of
interest are we also focusing on
those such as
Like community that could be
chopped up in half, for example,
if it's a neighborhood that half
the neighborhood is in Grandma's
district, the rest of it is in
uncle's district, and they have
two different representatives.
How are we going to talk about
communities of interest in this
dialogue, Madam Chairman.
Madame Chair and Representative
communities of interest are
definitely considered
traditional redistricting
principles and would be included
in the enabling legislation.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair, that
clears it up. And I don't know
if you had anything to add to
that, sir. Oh.
Thank you. um.
There, there are concerns
expressed by, for example, the
community of Azuni.
As to how at the moment they're
split.
Um, in, in two districts.
And they prefer that as they
consider themselves as a
community of interest that they
prefer to be a part of one
district. So those are some of
the areas of concerns that have
been expressed uh in, in the
dialogues that we have had with
other indigenous communities.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you for that. And I appreciate
that because in the last
districting redistricting. I
know, and I'm, I have another
question in here about the
congressional, which I think you
said doesn't apply to
congressional, but
Uh, regarding Mescalero, for
example, which is close to my
district. They're in two
federally, they're in two
different congressional
districts, right? They're split
kind of in half. And I think
that is a conversation that
needs to also be considered why,
why was that?
Enabled in the last
redistricting and if Zuni wants
to be together, I want to make
sure that we don't have everyone
be monolithic and say, well,
everyone wants to be together,
everyone wants to be in two
different districts. How do we
find that? And I guess that that
is a conversation probably for
enabling legislation, but I'm
sure you probably have some
thoughts on that?
Madam Chairman.
Madam Chair and Representative,
that's correct. Communities of
interest need to be able to
speak to their own communities's
interest directly, some may want
to be in separate districts, as
happened in our last
redistricting session, and some
may want to be unified. That is
part of the meeting process and
the public meeting process and
the representation of those
communities of interest in the
selection process that all has
to happen in the enabling
legislation, and I look forward
to the creation of.
that within the next 5 years.
Thank you, Madam Chairman. And
then I guess just a question,
maybe not specifically on the
resolution, but it ties into it
and this is the last question I
promise. So, regarding the curr
CRC.
With the enabling legislation
need to strike the current CRC
since we are creating a new
redistricting commission and not
a committee. How does that work,
uh, strategically or
In practice, Madam Chairman.
That is also a decision that
will have to be made by the
legislature.
Whether to repeal the entire CRC
or leave it in place for
congressional districts or to
create the enabling legislation
for the independent commission
and have their maps be sent to
the legislature for final
approval and changes the way the
CRCs work.
That is something we will have
to decide.
Thank you, Madam Chairman.
That's all.
Thank you, Representative
Representative Little.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you so much for the information
this morning and I'm bringing
this forward. Um, my question,
Madam Chair, is on uh
It would help me to, uh, and I
think uh my colleagues.
To clarify, if I could get some
clarification on item C on page
3,
Uh, let's see, and it may have
been answered.
Earlier, I, my apologies, I was
listening to the responses, so I
kind of lost my question there,
but um,
No, I believe my question was
answered. Thank you very much.
Appreciate the explanation you
provided earlier.
Thank you. Any other questions
from committee members.
Representative Lujan. Thank you,
Madam Chair. Uh, thank you for
bringing this word.
Um, I'm a bit familiar with
this. I was a new legislator,
um.
Um
When we had the registered team,
uh,
done in
reported a lot of this. So what
are, and you may have gone over
this and I apologize. What are
the main differences from this,
from the previous legislation
you had regarding creating the
commission, Madam Chair.
Madam Chair and Representative
clarification. Main differences
between this and the CRC or main
differences between this and the
2024 proposal. The latter, Madam
Chair.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
Representative. The main
difference is the removal of
congressional districts.
The rest of the changes are
minor, um, what was not there in
2024, that's also important is
establishing the legal standard
of legal standing of the
commission.
Appreciate that, that's all I
have. Thank you very much.
Senator Lucas.
Uh, thank you. Thank you, Madam
Chair, and um,
Thank you for your presentation.
I apologize, I missed a bit um
earlier.
And is of course, um, Madam
Chair, you know, these measures
have been brought in front of
the legislature many a time.
And in my previous role, I
served as the chair of Senate
Rules Committee.
And over time, um, I have also
been honored to serve as
co-chair of the redistricting
Committee for 33 different
redistricting, um, times.
Yeah
And as we know, um, Madam Chair,
redistricting is political.
It's not supposed to be, and I
know when we've had the
attorneys in front of us and
such, they say this is not to be
a political endeavor, but it is
the reality.
Um
And I know that we did.
OK, the measures come in front
of us in different format forms,
so I know this is a a little
crafted a little bit different.
Um, so I think it'll be
interesting, Madam Chair, for us
to have a discussion this coming
session again.
Um, but I always have some
concerns.
Um, and, and just because of the
nature of the business we're in,
that's political.
Um, politics has and drives
everything that we do. And as we
become more polarized.
It is even more so that we have
to have caution.
As to what it is that we put in
the Constitution.
Um, because the Constitution is
very hard to change when
something is placed in, and we
know that, whether it's the
United States Constitution to
amend it through constitutional
amendments or even for our
state.
And Madam Chair, there's been
discussion about having a a
state constitutional revision
commission, um, Senator
Cervantes and others have
proposed that over years and it
still hasn't passed either
chamber.
Um, and I'm not saying yes or no
to this again, but still some
concerns that I hope as we go
into session that we review this
because part of it when you
create a commission, um, and I
know this time we had the the
legislatively created committee.
Which did the work of what
previously the legislative
committee used to do. I chaired
that along with Mary Helen
Garcia, Representative Garcia,
and who were the state house
representative persons with me,
and we traveled much as to what
the committee did this year, so
they took kind of our role out,
which was good and had, you
know, some persons who traveled
to state and did what I call a
lot of hard work where you go to
the communities and listen.
Um, part of the, the issue,
Madam Chair, is
Getting interest and
participation of community
because the persons who still
show up at those community
meetings that the committee
commission, whoever, are still
political.
We can't take politics out of
redistricting. It ain't gonna
happen.
Because of the life of politics
that we are currently in, we are
polarized.
OK, I'm just letting it sit for
a little bit.
When I first started, this may
have worked very well. This was
30 years ago.
Where we are leading to at this
point, I believe the legislature
still needs to maintain.
A, a role in this and not just
adopting what was proposed by
another commission who was
appointed.
On the persons who are appointed
to this commission, and I've
mentioned it before.
is
You can have one Native American
representative on that
commission, that's only one.
Out of the others who are on the
committee.
You know, and I've asked you
this before about having some
verbiage in here about to
reflect the demographic makeup
of the state.
Right?
Um
You have to have preferences in
here to make sure that Hispanos,
Native Americans, and all the
others are represented on the
commission itself.
And you also have to look at
gender.
I mean, you know, those are
important things, especially if
you're going to put something in
the Constitution, that's
reflective of that.
Um, the other concern is too, is
Oh
Well, I won't go into it because
there's just so much and we'll,
we'll have the discussion when
it comes to us in committees
anyway, but these are just some
of the concerns that I have.
Um, to have something in statute
is much easier to change and
amend.
Because if you make a mistake in
the Constitution.
Oh my
And we're stuck with it.
And then you have to go back and
try and change it, Madam Chair
is pretty difficult to do.
Um
And there's a whole, you know,
slurry of other issues, and I, I
mean.
I just have concerns.
Um
And yes, it may may have worked
in other states. It may have, it
may not. I don't know, but it
still gets down to be political.
And I appreciate.
The input that was given from
the Native American community
with the maps that they proposed
for us to consider.
I really do, um, because of the
actual work in coalition
building of all of the tribes,
right, the nations.
Pueblos, I mean, everybody
worked together and I thought
that was so needed for us to
have when that came to us in
session.
Um, and I believe what also
affords us the opportunity if
the commission proposes
something that is not of value
to our communities in the state.
The legislature can't do
anything.
And yet we are elected to
represent our communities also.
So where is our voice?
Yes, of course, yes, it's
self-serving and such, but, um,
Madam Chair, this whole new
world of politics that we're in
changes the concept for me.
And again, I'm just sharing this
because we'll have a discussion
when it comes in front of Senate
rules and judiciary and goes
over if it starts in the house,
depending.
But I think these are serious
concerns for us to keep in mind.
Um
You know, for the next
generation that's coming up. How
is this going to affect them?
We're older. We're moving on
with the next generation that's
coming up. How does this affect
them?
So some questions I wanted to
ask Madam Chair.
And no comment needed. I just
wanted to share some of my
concerns that I have.
Uh, because I've seen it come
and go over the last 30 years.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator.
OK, so my turn.
Um, the input given by Senator
Lopez.
You know, that experience of
being in office to seeing the
changes.
This particular redistricting
was um historical in the sense
of having the tribes nations and
pueblo's voices heard.
But that really came from this
support of the governor.
Did the maps that the
redistricting commission came up
with match the maps that the
tribes nations and pueblos came
up with.
My recollection is they did it.
So how much input was given by
our tribes nations and pueblos,
and I'm just making that a point
because this is the Indian
Affairs Committee.
And
My understanding is Arizona.
Does Arizona have an independent
redistricting commission?
So even after they generated
their maps, my understanding is
that Navajo Nation practically
had to go into litigation.
Um, with some of the districts
are not litigation, but had to
stand the line.
In Arizona?
That those maps were still not
decided for quite a while out
because they were still trying
to negotiate.
So, you know, in some areas, um,
I don't know about what other
states I think there does still
need to be more discussion on
this, especially when we talk
about our indigenous tribes,
nations and pueblos, having the
right makeup so that um their
voice is really relevant in a
commission.
Um, there was a young lady that
I met up in the South Dakota, I
believe.
Very, very gerrymandered state,
her district is practically her
reservation.
How is she supposed to get
support with the rest of the
legislature when nobody else but
her.
She's the only one that has skin
in the game to do for her
community. Nobody else, there's
no leverage there, um, as far as
even voting.
Uh, within her legislature.
So, and I don't know if they
have an independent
redistricting committee there.
Our commission. So the more
discussion has to be had.
Um
But I believe New Mexico has
come a long way, like you said,
this was something very
historical. There was a bit of a
Afraid there cause we should.
My understanding was to be here
for a couple of days but didn't
turn out like that.
But that was important. It was
very essential that we got it
right.
I think we got very close. I
know there was some pushback on
the congressional districts, but
that's where I think um if we're
gonna do this then.
Why shouldn't it be all of it.
If we really feel like this is
the way to go, to put it in the
Constitution, then it should be
all the redistricting should be
considered.
If we really get this right,
then we should have 100% buy in
um by the legislature.
So, um,
A chair is back, I will.
I don't know if you want, um, if
you have anything to say about
the redistricting, um, this
particular bill.
Thank you, did, uh, do we have
any more? OK, we don't have any
more comments from our committee
members, Representative Lujan.
I would say this cause
Um, I've been involved in
redistricting. I actually worked
for, for the census. I, I've,
I've worked in different
capacities and you know, when I
initially came in, I, I fully
supported, you know, the, um,
independent commission.
And had a lot of questions and
we got this hybrid, right? um.
And then after going through
this and being a legislator
myself and seeing some of the
You know, one district in
particularly in our state that
is the most affluent district.
I'll give a comparison.
Become 30% more affluent.
Um, why did that happen?
And so I think having a hybrid
and taking some of the, the, the
concerns and questions that
Senator Lopez has, I think we
need to really, really fully
flush this out because I think
the work that you did, I was
following you. I was engaging
in, in uh a lot of the
community, um, meetings even
though you didn't know I was
there I was either by Zoom or
was there um in person.
And I'd like to say you did an
amazing job. I, I fully
fully support that that
structural interaction and
engagement.
Um, and some of the feedback we
got, like we heard from, from,
from, um, I believe then
Representative Georgine Lewis
led the the legislation for the,
the federal um maps and the
federal redistricting, and it
got really heated.
Um, so I think we, I think that
a hybrid and and the way that
things are going, I think we
need to, um, we need to flush
that out. We need to consider,
you know, how, how this
commission is going to be
appointed and really fully
represent, but I'd also like to
say as a legislator now for 4
years.
We know our communities, we have
engagement, and we deserve uh uh
a voice in this process.
I think that that is, that is,
that is part of why we, you
know, we are legislators and
representatives, senators were
all representatives of our
communities, and we should know
them, and we should have that
engagement as well. I know that
I go to every extra mile to do
that myself.
And I feel like my voice is a
representation of my district.
But I'd, I'd say that, you know,
for all the good things that we,
we did with this commission and
this hybrid system we created,
we need to, we need to have, we
need to flush this out a little
bit more, but I'd say that
You know, the that comparison
with that one district that is
the most affluent in the state
and even regionally.
To become 30% more affluent.
was not the intention of what we
had planned with having um a
commission.
And then coming back to the
legislature. So I'd just say
there's caution. I hear that
cautionary voice here and I'd
like to respect that as well.
Thank you.
Representative Block.
Thank you, Madam Chairman, and I
appreciate the the input from
the committee and I think all
the work that the CRC did was so
cool, right? Like, I attended
every CRC meeting, and I, I
listened to all the testimony,
and I think that is like the
gold standard of what we're
looking for. We're looking for
community engagement, and we
want people to show up. And I
know that there's an argument
that says people who attend
meetings are more politically
inclined than people who don't.
But I don't want to put people
in a box and say, well, just
cause you weren't able to go to
a Zoom meeting cause you were
working, that you didn't care as
much as someone who may have had
the day off or someone who's
retired who has more time to do
that. So I do want to make sure
that we don't devalue people's
voices just cause they weren't
able to show up in person, cause
a lot of times they, they sent a
lot of emails and I'm sure you,
you read through all of the
testimony that that we heard,
and people truly care about how
their district is made up. They
care about their neighborhoods,
they care about
Their communities, their tribes,
their nations, and they don't
want to be split up or or put in
a box, for example. So,
I guess my final comments, and
I'm sorry to, to keep on having
questions about this is, I do
think that there's like kind of
a poison pill in this spill that
I just saw now, and I think it
might have been in previous
versions, but the poison pill is
on page 3 at the bottom.
We're asking the legislature.
To
Give away the power which I get.
I love that. I, I will give away
as much power to the people as I
possibly can, right? But when it
comes to the voting address of
the incumbent.
And saying that that cannot be
considered, I think that would
probably be a really hard pill
to be swallowed because I know
that was specifically something
that they wanted to provide for
in the last redistricting.
So I think that's something
that's kind of, I mean, I, I'm
totally
Supportive, I will vote for it.
I don't care if they, if they
take my district away from me
and I, I'm in a different
district. I'll run in that
district cause it's my community
still. But I think that's
something that may be hard to
swallow for some legislators,
not me, but some people.
And then also I, I do think it's
really hard to swallow as well
for me, the congressional.
Removal, taking away the drawing
of congressional districts in
this.
Independent move because if
we're looking for true
independence, then it should
include all districts, because
if we're gonna have a
A discussion, a dialogue on
redistricting and making
changes, but it's like, oh, it's
only only state house, state
senate, and PEC but not
The congressional districts that
represent those smaller
districts within them. I think
that
It's kind of a turn off for me
and I
I'm inclined to support this,
but
I would be more inclined to
maybe
Support it as a without wreck if
we even do that and
In a
Interim committees, but I think
that's just something to to be
considered. So I know that
that's a lot to throw at you. I
don't know if you had a response
representative, but
Please tell me I'm wrong. I hope
I'm wrong.
Madam Chair and Representative,
you have put your finger on the
key pieces of this proposal.
Um, the conflict between
legislators literally drawing
their own districts is the
inherent conflict of interest
that this proposal is trying to
remove and make independent.
That is why 70% of the New
Mexican population has stepped
forward and said they wanted to
be independent. That is what
makes this proposal a bold step
forward in restoring the public
faith in our democratic
processes and
Right now is the time we have to
think about that.
I am
Dealing with constituents right
now who, with many expletives
included are saying to me, don't
send me mail, don't call my
home, don't canvas.
Because it doesn't matter. I'm
not gonna vote. It doesn't
matter.
And my heart is breaking for New
Mexico. This is a bold statement
of good faith in your government
to restore these peoples faith
in democracy or at least take a
step in that direction and say,
look, we are removing our hands
from meddling in the maps.
That
Declare and determine our own
voters. We are taking our
addresses out of the mix.
There's no protecting me.
There is
Serving the communities of
interest.
In drawing these maps.
And that is an essential piece.
The congressional peace is
removed because that needs to be
federal legislation.
That has to apply to all states,
it needs to be independent.
Um
But that's a federal independent
federal piece of legislation
that needs to pass.
And I hope I've addressed those
two concerns.
Madam Chair.
back to you.
Thank you
I appreciate it. Sorry, Madam
Chair, I just, uh, I think
that's good. I mean, I agree,
but I also think there, there
are states that do have an
independent redistricting
commission and it includes
congressional races. So yeah, of
course, we want the feds to do
something, but it takes
literally an act of Congress for
that to happen, and Lord knows
that's not going to happen.
Sorry, but I think it's the
state's responsibility to do
that.
And also I'm, I'm a big
supporter of this idea, right? I
was a co-sponsor of Senator
Jaramilo's bill last year, or
resolution last year, because I
think that's so important that
we do it, but it's cause it
included congressional races,
and also because I think
It transcends the legislative
political power plays that we
that we deal with day to day,
right? No matter who has the
that roundhouse during the time
of redistricting, one political
party or one set of individuals,
whoever they may be left or
right. We just want it to
transcend those lines so that
communities of interest are
always included. So I think, I
don't want to come off as like
hostile to your legislation, but
I do want to say that it
definitely is important to have
this conversation.
But
If it's going to be fair and
equitable, I think that needs to
also be congressional races. So,
That's just my two cents,
whatever they may be worth.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative, uh,
Representative Allison Chennai.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Oh
My question is on the wording in
the title.
It states proposing to amend the
Constitution of New Mexico to
provide for the creation.
The key word is the creation.
Does that mean that there is
currently not an independent
redistricting commission.
We're creating something.
That we're hoping.
That they will address the rest
of the contents of the 3 pages.
How do we know?
That the people that we select.
are going to satisfy the content
of the rest of the resolution.
So that is my question.
We establishing a board that
we're hoping will do what we ask
them to do in a sense.
I think the title is very, very
broad.
It there's a specifically say
The, the, this is what the uh
The commission will do. It says
we're going to create them so
that we hope they do what we
say.
In the outline of the
resolution.
Madam chair and Representative,
yes, it is the creation of a
commission that does not exist,
it cannot exist at this point
with our Constitution as it
stands because of section D on
page 2.
Um, but that's why the next
section lays out in the
Constitution, what this
commission wants to do. This
commission will sign an oath to
follow the Constitution and will
follow what is laid out here in
sections A, B, C, and D.
It is not a hope, it is a
constitutional requirement, and
the reason that it is in this
resolution is to make sure that
it is in the Constitution and
must be followed.
There are many pages of details
and how this would work, that
would still have to be created
in enabling legislation in
statute that the legislature
would create.
And then the commission would
have to follow that law, both by
constitution and law, they would
have their parameters to get the
job done.
Well thank you for that and the
way I understand this
resolution. Is that or going to
establish a commission.
Why doesn't it?
Just go that far. We're gonna
establish a commission. That's
it.
All the comets that have been
made.
Positive or against it? How do
we know that's going to be
complied with.
Um
Before we established the
commission.
How do we know that?
Everything that's mentioned for
the past 30 years is not going
to be nullified.
Why doesn't our resolution just
say we're going to establish a
an independent redistricting
commission.
Period.
Why does it outline what the
rest is expected of them.
Let's just have a resolution
that says let's establish a
Independent redistricting
commission.
And then after they're selected,
then we issue another
legislation giving them.
But, um, outcome we desire, the
public.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Would you like to respond?
Madam Chair and Representative,
I'm not sure what sections of
the proposal that the
representative is, is
suggesting.
We strike, so I'm not quite sure
how to respond, Madam Chair.
Madam Chair and members of the
committee.
There were some points raised
about the indigenous
Um
The quarter of the state.
Essentially designated the
northwest quadrant of the state.
Uh, where a lot of indigenous
peoples and communities are
located in, in New Mexico.
When we talk about paragraph C
on page 3.
Um
It talks about protecting
minorities.
Uh, in that paragraph.
Haven't had the experience in
redistricting the past couple of
cycles.
I've always made the point that
When it comes to minorities, we
will always come to.
A certain point in the whole
process.
People can do whatever they want
to with redistributing plants.
Throughout the state and which
for whichever plan that they're
developing for the house, the
Senate, the Congress.
We have the Voting Rights Act of
1965.
And that voting rights Act
protects
Minorities
And we as minorities, classified
people.
have to raise those concerns
and, and I have done that.
Through the whole process of
redistricting.
I raised those concerns about
section 2.
Of the Voting Rights Act.
You cannot ignore it.
Whatsoever.
And I think we did a pretty good
job the last round in 2021,
especially when we had the uh
Justice Chavez.
As the chair of the
redistricting citizen
redistriting committee.
He knew ins and outs of the
Voting Rights Act.
Part of our responsibility as
mappers. I'm a mapper.
And draw these maps.
is that I also have to raise the
conditions of the, of the Voting
Rights Act.
There used to be section 5.
Which was preclearance, that's
done away in June of 2023, 2013
by the US Supreme Court.
But just this year in June.
The Supreme Court considered
Section 2
Of the Voting Rights Act.
And it did not take that away.
Matter of fact, in my opinion,
it validated section 2.
And the Supreme Court case that
came from, I believe, North
Carolina.
So in, in those conditions.
Um, I'm gonna be an advocate
raising the concerns for
section.
See in this proposal.
And it's my responsibility to
ensure
That when we go through the
process,
Uh, that, that section too is
respected.
On the Arizona side, we do the
same thing.
Yes.
Um, the population has decreased
all over.
Particularly from Navajo Nation.
But also in 2020 when the census
happened, there were concerns
about um less count because of
the pandemic.
And you as a legislature created
the sliding deviation.
And, and that was the positive 3
to a -7.
That that was a play throughout
the whole process.
So when you look at your
legislative districts on the
northwest quadrant.
With the probably with the
exception of one.
All of them are below the -5.
And, and those were the
consideration of this particular
paragraph C.
And, and that is to respect the
Voting Rights Act of 1965.
We all have to. There's no way
around that unless
The federal government takes
that away. Uh, so, and then the
other area of the points in this
proposal is the size of, of the
body.
And, and yes, we are very
concerned. Our presidential
nomination raised a point about
not having a Native American on
the citizen redistricting
Committee in the past.
Um, and yes, the, the larger the
size, the better opportunity for
Native American to serve on, on
this body.
OK
So that's why we do support the
elevation from 7 to 9.
There's a better opportunity for
Native American to be appointed.
Yes, if Americans applied for
the positions, uh, in the, in
the round of 2021.
They weren't selected.
So the, the intent here is to
ensure that the geographic
demographic representation is,
is applied in the selection of
The body that weed and
commission.
And it took 3 cycles on the
Arizona side.
For Native American to become a
member of the independent
redistricting commission.
Thank you.
Thank you. Any other questions
by committee members,
Representative Little.
Thank you, Madam Chair. So let
me begin, uh, Madam Chair, by
thanking all of my colleagues
for their input for the points
that they've made, uh, and the
contributions they've made to
this discussion.
Um
What I'm looking at is that, uh,
having been part of the
redistricting process in 2021. I
recall very vividly the reasons
that we actually got to that
point and that was because, and
this one I think is important to
point out.
That Madam Chair, this was the
first redistricting maps that
did not get decided by a judge.
Previous to this, the last 30.
Years or more, uh, I may be
mistaken, but the last.
Uh, every
Every redistricting proposal uh
cycle that was established that
was drawn up by the legislature
was challenged in court. It took
even longer, and no one was
happy with the results, as I
recall, um, the discussions
being put forward. So this
experience of 2021, Madam Chair,
I look at.
As the experience of what
worked, what didn't work.
Putting this, I'm looking
forward to the continuation of
all of these points being
discussed.
When we get to this bill in our
committees, and I think that
there's some very important
considerations that have been
offered this morning and um um
I'm hopeful that we're gonna
keep in mind that this process
did result from those
legislative actions and um
Uh, Madam Chair, I, I
Don't require, uh, I don't think
there's a response that's
required. I just wanted to make
sure to point this out, um.
Having been on that side of the
table, it was very important uh
to me to bring this up.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, thank you for your
presentation.
the chair.
Um, would you have any closing
comments?
No, madam Chair, I appreciate
the conversation and the time in
the committee and the feedback
on this bill, I think many of
the incredibly important issues.
Having been raised, will need to
be addressed in that enabling
legislation that is where the
nuts and bolts will be created,
but we can't get to that point
without a constitutional
resolution that allows the
commission to exist.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, committee.
terrible
Learning further action.
Thank you for your presentation
and have more discussions in the
future.
We will move on to the Health
councils, please come forward.
And you may begin.
Good morning, Madam Chair and
members of the Indian Affairs
Committee, Valeria Alarcon here,
executive director at the New
Mexico Alliance of Health
Councils Backbone organization
and advocate for 33 counties and
currently 10 tribal health
councils. Thank you, um, on
behalf of all of us across the
state for this time and
opportunity to connect with you
about the critical work of
county and tribal health
councils. As you know, for over
30 years, they have been the
Lifeline for New Mexicans
serving communities where they
are at. Health councils as you
have learned, um, are very much
the connective tissue of public
health in concert with NMDOH and
in the context of public health
in New Mexico, we have a
centralized regional public
health system. And in essence,
health councils operate as an
extension to the Department of
Health.
And they are also an
instrumental partner obviously
in improving the health and
wellbeing of our communities
across counties and tribal
communities, and their work is
not only deeply aligned with the
North Star with the Department
of Health NorthStar, but there,
their work is very pivotal in
achieving this shared goal. And
if, if this is the first time
you're hearing about the North
Star, um, it is essentially a
shared goal in becoming the
healthiest state.
in this nation by 2040 and
that's a, a very quick
turnaround time. Um, I think it
takes all of us in our own ways
to work together to serve
communities.
And I'm happy to answer any
questions you may have.
OK.
Committee members, do we have
any questions, concerns,
comments.
Representative Little, so, um,
uh, could you, uh, Madam Chair,
uh, I would, um,
Appreciate some um expansion on
the
$43 million.
is going to be expended. Did I
hear through?
2040.
Am I understanding that
correctly?
Thank you, Madam Chair,
Representative Little. Um, so
the, the call for reinstating
recurring optimal funding based
on HB 137, which stipulates the
role function of county and
tribal health councils. As, as
you may know, health councils
were defunded in 2010. Um, it
has been an uphill battle. Um,
we are so grateful to the
steadfast leadership of
Representative Allison,
co-sponsors, um, who this year
were
So successful in um securing a
one-time year allocation of $3
million which is keeping about
109 positions uh stable this
year in public health across
county and tribal health
councils. To your point,
Representative Little, the $43
million is uh a request for
recurring funding. The reason
being when we think about public
health infrastructure, health
councils need to be uh
So
in the sense of their capacity,
operations, programmatic
services, intervention
prevention efforts, cross-sector
collaborations with behavioral
health, other state agencies,
care service providers, various
key partners to really bridge
the gap in accessing uh primary
care services and essential
resources uh to excel and live a
happy, healthy life. The other,
um, just
ation here is that although we
have been very successful in, in
thanks to our colleague
Geraldine Antonio, tribal
liaison at NMHC in concert with
NMDOH and listing, um.
Currently 10, uh
Tribal health councils, Pueblo
of Acoma, Pueblo of Cochiti,
Pueblo of Nambe, Pueblo of
Pierre, Pueblo of Sandelfonso,
Pueblo of Santa Ana, Pueblo of
Santa Clara, Pueblo of Santo
Domingo, Pueblo of Tesuki in
Canoito Ben of Navajos. We're
currently enlisting new
partnerships with Pueblo Poaque,
Zia and Zuni, and we still have
9 remaining pueblos that we are
uh
string collaborations and future
partnerships in addition to our
nation as well. So that 43
million gives us that buffer to
take care of our tribal
communities that we're still
building relationships with.
Thank you. Thank you for that
response. Um, actually, I was
just, I had forgotten. Thank
you, Madam Chair, for allowing
the question, um, uh, I do now
recall, thank you for the
reminder that this was to
re-establish this funding stream
that had been discontinued in
2010 and in the ensuing, what is
this 14 years, uh, the, the, um,
Efforts by your organization and
the rest of the tribes to make
up and do as best as they could
in this in this time period.
Actually demonstrates the
necessity for re-establishing
this fund, um, within the
department, um, so thank you
very much. That's, that's all
that I have, Madam Chair. Thank
you.
Thank you, Representative Vice
Chair Pinto. Thank you, Madam
Chair and members of the
committee.
So yesterday we had the New
Mexico tribal behavioral Health
Providers Association.
That was here in um been working
for many years, um.
is
So one of the things in my area.
is if we duplicate services.
Um
And they really need
coordination.
And that was one of the the
biggest things that really um
helped this last I think year
with our um Four Corners detox
and uh.
Not Center.
That they really got together
and, you know, um, try to fill
those gaps for us. We still have
a long term.
Uh, services gap though.
Are you in coordination with
them, and will they be able to
dip into this funding, um,
That, that the way it's written
here.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um,
Senator Pinto, yes, uh, we are
very aware of the great work of
the New Mexico Tribal Behavioral
Health Providers Association.
We're in partnership with Cindy
Sacomman and we exploring ways
in which we can collaborate so
that we can be more well
coordinated at the local level,
connecting people to resources,
and of course, one of the many
partners that in this case,
let's say tribal health
councils, uh, coordinate
services.
um, whether it's NMDOH and or
our new healthcare authority,
we're also in conversations with
them to really take stock of how
many CHW's healthcare.
Sorry, care, healthcare workers
in CHRs in our tribal
communities within our, the uh
tribal health councils are
currently licensed so that we
can partner with these state
agencies to really address the
Medicaid, Medicare population,
and in our tribal communities,
you know, we provide home visits
to sit with our families, our
community members, our elders,
and in some cases translate a
lot of these medicaid, Medicare
services to make sure that
that they are supported in
navigating the services and also
in uh accessing those services.
We're also in collaboration with
the Behavioral Health
Collaborative.
So, Madam Chair, members I'm
specifically talking about that
particular association because
of their response to my
district, and, you know, I don't
know what really um but it it
was very important that
response, um, especially after
when we have a dramatic um
episodes happen out in the area,
um, so I'm gonna hold you to
that if I support this.
And so, thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, colleagues, uh, what
is the pleasure of the
committee?
Madam Chair,
I motion that we
Oh
support this legislation because
what was not mentioned was in
addition to the 9 pueblos in the
community of Tohejili. They also
operate in 33 counties and
McKinley County, headed by
Christopher.
Christopher Hudson, Chris Hudson
is thriving very, very well, and
they have gone beyond just the
health care. They went into
housing some of the homeless
people, so it is very beneficial
in our areas, and there's plans
to open satellite projects in
other uh communities, so, uh, my
recommendation to the committee
is to endorse this, and
I think uh maybe we should add a
wording in here that says
recurring.
For the past 6 years I have been
running with the legislation.
I've been sponsoring legislation
every year since 2019 to get
appropriations for health
councils. Let's not continue
making resolution or legislation
every year. Let's make it a part
of a reoccurring process.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Mr. Madam Chairman, may I
interject on that for just a
moment. Thank you. And I, and I,
well I support uh tribal Health
councils and I have uh openly
requested uh the balances to be
released that are just been
sitting there at the Department
of Health and so on and
appreciate them very much. I
wish we could request recurring.
Let me tell you how this works
in a bill and appropriate
general appropriations bill like
this one.
Uh, we can't find future
legislators and legislatures,
both.
Um, and so what we do is we put
um I know because I tried it
before, so they stopped me.
Um, a long time ago, I learned,
but um, what it is is the way
this is gonna work is it would
be, for example, if it's
endorsed and it passes this
committee, then it goes on and
it's going to reach the finance
committee, uh, and when it does,
what happens is it's temporarily
tabled.
Uh, because the first question
that comes up is, is this money
and house bill too?
If it isn't in House Bill 2,
then where is the money gonna
come from?
And so it gets temporarily
tabled, meaning that it's going
to be set aside just for further
Research and review to see where
we can come up with some of the
money if it's not in-house bill
too. Now you can proceed to work
with the um house Appropriations
Committee also initially because
the, the LFC recommendation of
the budget goes into house
appropriations and then house
appropriations gets the bill,
which is House Bill 2.
And um and then maybe you can
get some funding in there, so
when it comes into finance, the
finance committee will get a
hold of it and support it, but
um.
Yeah, so just to tell you, I
just didn't want your bill, uh,
representative to be stopped
because it's recurring and we
can't find, they told me at the
legislative council of future
legislatures. Thank you, but,
but it can proceed as written
just as it is, and they'll know
that it is non-recurring and um
and then in any amount future
can be recurring. Yeah, if you
have junior bill or in the grow,
you can do stuff like that
recurring. I, I mean.
For 34 years and then you, you
prove it works and they'll leave
it in recurring.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator.
Representative Little.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um, I'd
like to understand more, uh, as
a new, uh,
Newer legislator. Uh, Senator,
uh, Senator, uh, Rodriguez's,
um, um,
Information that she shared
about how it uh would be very
difficult, if not impossible to
make it recurring at this point.
My question then is, you made
reference to we could not, uh,
current legislators could not
commit future.
Um, you, we can't bind them.
Thank you very much. Um,
Can, because my question
referred earlier, Madam Chair,
to whether this was for a period
of time, a long period of time.
Mm
Might it be
Uh, would it be uh during art
would having it for 2 years
established for 2 years,
spelling that out that that be
received each for 2 years. Is
that
Might that be allowable?
Uh, based on the uh information
that you shared with us and if
this requires a deeper
discussion to for, for me, the
newer uh legislature working
with appropriations, I'd be
happy to um get some education
on that. Yes, yes. Thank you.
Would you like to respond to her
question, please.
Thank you, Madam Chair
Representative Little. Um, what
I, what I know to be true.
Um, in reference to HB 137, that
stipulates the role function uh
of county tribal health councils
in concert with NMDOH. I think
it's section 6 letter D of HB
137. Um, the original state
statue that
Funding is to be allocated for
health council's operation,
administration, um, in
activities, in concert with TOH,
so, so.
That's what we sort of anchor
ourselves in. It's this original
state statute, and then
moreover, within the context of
public health. They are the
connective tissue of public
health infrastructure. We have a
centralized system for regional
offices.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I just
have received information that
pointed out uh the um balance
would be carried through 2026,
which actually is exactly on my,
my question, so thank you, Madam
Chair, for allowing me. Thank
you. Thank you.
OK. We have a motion to move um.
To endorse and we have a 2 by
Representative Little and
Senator Pinto. Um, do we have
any opposition to this motion?
Seeing none, uh, your, uh, your,
your, uh, your, your bill is
endorsed your.
Draft bill is endorsed.
Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
members of committee on behalf
of County and Tribal Health
Council. Thank you. With that,
we'll move on to liquor tax.
Uh, please, please begin. Thank
you. Yeah.
Good morning, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. Nice
to see you again, um, Cindy
Sockerman.
We're going to be any sacrament.
I'll do a quick introduction for
myself and then I'll pass it to
um my colleague.
Cindy Sockerman, um, evaluator
and also director of the Tribal
behavioral Health Providers
Association.
Good morning. Um, thank you,
Madam Chair and members of the
committee for having us today.
My name is Marlena Lira. I'm a
substance use researcher and
President-elect of the New
Mexico Society of Addiction
Medicine. Thank you so much for
having us and pass it back to
you, Cindy.
So before we start, we do want
to recognize and acknowledge the
fact that we are meeting today
in the unseeded ancestral lands
of the Pueblo, Navajo and Apache
people, and we are um extremely
grateful and humbled um for
their current and past work.
We want to quickly recognize
some of our um legislatures and
our co-sponsors on the bill, um,
additionally, we would like to
also recognize some of the
sponsors that have been bringing
up the conversation around
alcohol throughout the session.
Our our first main point is that
New Mexico leads.
The nation in alcohol-related
deaths.
And we have since 1997. We have
ranked 1st, 2nd, or 3rd since
'81.
And it sounds like a lot of
folks are familiar with our
overdose rates. We were, we are
the 6th highest in our state for
overdose nationally, and yet for
alcohol, it is twice that rate.
Youth drinking is also
associated with increased rates
and increased harm.
And in our state alone, 21% of
New Mexicans indicate of youth,
indicate first drink before the
age of 13.
next slide.
This graph just demonstrates
that between 2019 and 2021,
there has been an increase of
31%.
And we reached our all-time high
in our state in 2021.
And after that, we still have
had over 2000 deaths.
We know that alcohol related
deaths is something that can be
preventable. And when we hear
about goals like the North Star.
Addressing alcohol-related harms
is should be key in our state.
Um, next slide.
Cost of alcohol consumption in
our state is
Really high.
We have data from 2010 that
shows $2.2 billion. That's 2.77
per drink in over $1000 per
person.
And if we adjust for inflation,
that, that number increases to
3.1 billion.
Um, next slide.
One of the main things that we
have on in, in one of the slides
is how accessible, very low-cost
alcohol is in our state.
You'll see there's a photo that
shows um
Vodka for $4.29.
And that wasn't at a gas
station.
When we ask youth, young adults,
what they drink, vodka is there,
um choice. It's a higher content
alcohol, and it's also extremely
inexpensive in our state.
Um, folks talk about, um,
alcohol consumption in young
adults and, and how binge
drinking or heavy drinking might
look like and how impossible it
might be for them to drink at
higher rates.
But when you're out in the
community and you hear about how
much they're drinking, they can
reach those heavy rates.
Within 3 days. Um, next slide.
This is a very important slide,
especially for this committee
because we're talking about
We're talking about um looking
at race and ethnicity in New
Mexico.
In that table, you will see the
column on the left indicates
that
Indigenous communities are most
likely to abstain from drinking
alcohol.
And they're also the least
likely to report light or
moderate use, and yet when you
look at the column on the right.
You'll see that they are most
impacted by these
alcohol-related deaths.
Not a lot of people think about
alcohol consumption that way.
We hear, we constantly hear
throughout our state that
there's high levels of drinking
within the Native American
population, and that is just not
so.
Next slide.
The paradox of harm.
And I'm just going to read this
because I think it's important
to understand that when drinking
the same levels of alcohol,
disadvantaged populations
experienced greater health
harms.
And healthcare expenditures from
alcohol compared to advantaged
populations.
And although the upper income do
more of the drinking,
marginalized communities are
mostly impacted.
And that's for a variety of
reasons like structural violence
or um social determinants of
health.
Next slight
Um, so alcohol taxes are
considered a strong public
health um initiative. It's
supported by the World Health
Organization, the World Bank,
our own Department of Health and
the Bloomberg, um, task force.
Next slide.
Um,
the next slide just really
focuses on the current structure
of our alcohol taxes, and
there's a lot more information
about that in our slides.
Um, and then the differences
between um wholesale taxes and
um
sell taxes.
Both of them increased the price
and reduced consumption.
Um, but one has to be adjusted
for inflation.
And also one is sales taxes is
also paid by the consumers. Next
slide.
I'm gonna go through some of the
other slides and pass it on to
my colleague, um, there's a lot
more information about our tax
structure within the slides.
Thank you.
Thank you. So that raises the
question, what does New Mexico
need to do to finally move the
needle on alcohol related harms
in the state and health
disparities. So we have two
ambitious goals, which is to
pass legislation that.
One decreases population level,
alcohol consumption by 5 to 10%
and number 2, raise 200 to $250
million in annual tax revenue to
stabilize funding and bolster
public health investments for
prevention of excessive alcohol
use and treatment of alcohol use
disorder and related harms.
So, the bill that is under um
your consideration today for
endorsement is a new proposal.
It's, we're calling it the
hybrid alcohol harms alleviation
Act, and it has two parts.
The first part is to adjust
alcohol excise taxes for
inflation to account for the
inflation that has occurred
since the last time they were
increased and this, this
actually goes back to 1994,
because that's the last time
that alcohol taxes were
increased in New Mexico. So over
30 years.
The second part of the bill is
to introduce a 12% sales tax to
further discourage alcohol
consumption and generate stable
revenue. So, next slide, you
might wonder, well, why is the
proposal changing from previous
bills.
This hybrid bill
Is a combination of several
excellent ideas that have come
from the 2024 legislative
session.
Um, it maintains the excise tax
and updates it to current
values, which is consistent with
with all other states that do
not have um state monopolies of
alcohol sales, um, but it also
introduces a sales tax, which
has been encouraged and
suggested by representatives
Kadena, L Lente, and Parajon, so
that higher cost beverages, um,
yield greater taxes.
This proposal maintains and
actually increases funding to
existing programs in the statute
like the local DWI program, the
drug court program and
Farmington, and it also includes
the creation of a new fund, the
alcohol harms alleviation Fund,
wherein 25% of that fund would
go directly to tribes, nations,
and pueblos or the
implementation of prevention and
treatment programs, including
culturally relevant practices.
And furthermore, it meets the
two goals that we outlined
previously of reducing
consumption and also generating
stable revenue.
The next slide, how would this
bill change the prices of
beverages. I'll, I'll walk
through two examples. The first,
if you go to the next slide, is
the example of a price change on
a lower cost beverage, so this
is a picture of vodka from
Walmart's website, um, it costs
$7.98. Um,
This bill would increase the
cost of this example, vodka
beverage of about $2.50. So it
would be a a modest but
meaningful increase on the price
of a lower cost beverage, and
then if you go to the next
slide, there's an example of the
price change on a higher cost
beverage.
And this is um uh an expensive
scotch, uh, that's $110 retail
and this beverage would see an
increase in price of about $15
so that kind of shows how higher
cost beverages would see the
greatest increases.
Next slide. So what are the
anticipated public health
impacts.
This policy would decrease
alcohol consumption and raise
stable revenue for effective
programs and infrastructure,
depending on the model and the
assumptions that one uses to
estimate the impacts, um, it is
expected that population level
alcohol consumption would
decrease from about 4% to 11%,
and somewhere between 206 and
260 million would be raised
annually for public health
programs.
Um, and I'm providing those
ranges just to kind of give a
sense of the potential error
because again it depends on the
modeling assumptions.
Next slide.
So what can New Mexico do with
over 200 million in annual
revenue. Um, I mentioned we can
stabilize and increase funding
to existing programs, create the
alcohol harms alleviation fund
with 25% going directly to um
nations, tribes, and pueblos. If
you go to the next slide,
there's a, a list of sample
programs that have been
requested by state agencies and
community organizations, and
just to touch on the last um
presentation.
And this bill is definitely a
way to provide stable funding
for the health councils and the
Alliance of Health councils
going into the future, which are
so desperately needed in our
state.
Gonna move on in the interest of
time. I want to address a few
frequently asked questions that
have come up in past legislative
sessions. The first is, would
alcohol taxes be
disproportionately paid for by
and hurt marginalized
communities. Next slide.
So, it's actually a a commonly
known fact within the alcohol
literature and substance use and
prevention literature, that the
alcohol industry argues that
excise taxes on alcoholic
beverages are anti-poor and
regressive, and this is a quote
from the World Health
Organization, um, but this
argument does not take into
account the alcohol harm
paradox, which my colleague went
over a few minutes ago.
The harms from alcohol impose a
financial burden on
disadvantaged groups and these
individuals have high costs of
medicines, outpatient visits,
transport, diagnostics,
hospitalization, which need to
be paid for out of pocket
commonly if there is no
insurance. There was a modeling
study done on a pricing policy
in South Africa that estimated
that the policy would result in
almost a 50% reduction in
catastrophic.
Healthcare expenditures among
the um lower
SES segment of the population.
And next slide.
Furthermore, since most of the
alcohol in the state is consumed
by individuals who are white and
individuals who are higher
income, but.
The highest mortality is seen
among individuals who are
indigenous, Hispanic, and black.
Individuals who are white and
higher income would actually pay
the majority of this tax. And
furthermore, underresourced
communities would benefit
directly from all of the public
health investments and programs.
Um, Scotland recently
implemented a pricing policy and
actually found that um the
lowest income neighborhoods
benefited after implementing a
price policy, um, kind of
showing, showing this effect.
Next question, wouldn't it be
more compassionate to
underresource people, not to
intervene. Um, one might wonder
if it's cruel to make alcohol
less accessible to individuals
who are facing extreme hardship,
um, while this might come from a
place of compassion, this
actually enables more harm and
is really antithetical to the
very compassion motivating this
idea. This is um trying to
incentivize healthier behaviors.
through the use of market
forces. It's not, you know, in
including um police involvement,
criminalization, anything like
that. This is really trying to
use economic incentives to
encourage people to change their
behaviors. Next slide.
Why should we increase alcohol
taxes when it won't change
everyone's drinking patterns.
This is something that's come up
frequently. Um, I'd just like to
reiterate that the goal is
really not to stop all alcohol
consumption. This is not an
attempt to bring back
prohibition. The goal is really
to reduce population level
alcohol consumption and um
We would expect to see small
reductions, and yes, it may not
impact everybody, but the logic
of saying that this policy
shouldn't be implemented is
almost similar to saying,
Arguing against, say, an assault
weapons ban because it won't
stop all gun violence, right?
Um, we're not, we're not trying
to stop everything. We're trying
to, to make reductions.
Um, next slide, we know that New
Mexico is different from other
states and would increasing
alcohol taxes work here.
Well
Alcohol pricing strategies have
resulted in health benefits
across many, many jurisdictions
and diverse cultures and the
laws of economics, I would
argue, hold in New Mexico, even
though we are different in many
respects from other states and
New Mexico is actually benefited
from this same principle with
tobacco taxes and we've also
implemented taxes on cannabis
that we've entered the
recreational market.
So we are pretty confident that
taxes work for cannabis and
smoking, um, so they can work
for alcohol here.
And then lastly, couldn't we pay
for these public health
interventions from the general
fund. And while that is
possible, that's really only
half the battle. Um, what needs
to happen is a decrease in
population level, alcohol
consumption, and just allocating
money, throwing more money at
the problem, um, really would
have minimal effects on
population level behaviors. So
thank you so much for your time,
um, and we welcome any, any
questions or comments.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Representative Locke.
Thank you so much, Madam
Chairman. Thank you for the, the
presentation today. A few
questions, just clarifying. I
know that we're talking about
the data that we're using to
track.
Which states, for example, have
higher taxes, lower taxes, and
where those alcohol harms fall.
So from the statistics I've
seen, at least from the states
that I've looked at, such as
Alaska, they have the highest.
Amount of taxation on alcohol,
but they have not reduced any
harms.
In this, in these last few years
when they have raised those
taxes. So I'm just wondering,
Madam Chairman, how do you, how
do you factor that in as well as
other states that may have
Lower taxes, but also have very
low harm rates as well. Yeah.
Thank you, Madam Chair,
Representative. So you're right,
Alaska has implemented tax
increases and the issue is
really um inflation. Remarkably,
Alaska has done at least 2
alcohol tax increases that I'm
aware of, and it actually saw
29% decreases in mortality
following both of those, um, tax
increases. So Alaska actually
has benefited from um implement
ing higher alcohol taxes, but
because those taxes have not
kept up with inflation, the
effects dissipate over time and
this bill would account for
future adjustments for
inflation, so every 3 years, the
excise tax would continually be
adjusted so that the public
health impacts don't dissipate.
Thank you, Madam Chair
Representative.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you for that
clarification, and then other
states I've I've seen as well,
and I, I hate to go into the
weeds here and stuff, but I see
places like Colorado, they have
pretty high tax. I think Texas
there's like 240, which is lower
than ours, um.
So I'm just wondering, madam
chair.
I see this, the statistics are
looking different in different
states, and I know it's, it's
all different data that we're
getting and also with the death
rates. Is that what we're
primarily looking at death rates
or also uh
You know, hospital visits,
things like that related to
liver disease, things such as
that. How do we track that? Or
are we just barely on the
surface looking at death rates,
alcohol related versus not
alcohol related. Madam Chair.
Yeah, thank you, Madam Chair
Representative, um, yes, as you,
you pointed out, an excellent,
um, point or issue which is that
alcohol does more than um cause
cirrhosis and death from alcohol
use disorder. It's very
prevalent in suicide, very
prevalent in homicide, gun
violence, and here in in our
state as well, motor vehicle
crash fatalities, domestic
violence, child abuse and
neglect. So, and crime.
as well, so many of the, the
really critical issues that our
state is facing and trying to to
mitigate. Um, you raised the
point that states can have
different levels of taxes and
that those may or may not be um
directly correlated with the
harms and part of that has to do
with the actual cost of alcohol
in a state, and there are
unfortunately not amazing um
data available on the cost of a
standard drink.
For each individual state, um,
But if you have a high tax and
it's a sales tax, but your
alcohol is, say, 20 cents per
standard drink, even though that
that tax rate seems high. It's
really not going to to move the
needle on consumption because
the the floor price of the
alcohol is is so low. Um, I hope
that answers your question.
Happy to try to clarify or speak
with you further about it.
Thank you Madam Chair and thank
you both and I appreciate the
answer. I, I do think that's
something that we should
Definitely look into and I know
you probably have, so I don't
intend to try to diminish your
research cause it clearly you
have done your research and I
appreciate that. Uh, so, I guess
another question that I had just
quickly, I'll try to be as quick
as possible, madam chair, is
regarding the businesses that
will be affected by this, in
this legislation, is there any
kind of
parachute or something to help
those businesses that may be
having lower
Business numbers, less people
coming in to buy products
because of this newly
implemented tax, especially in
the lower income places like we
talked about.
Something that is in rural New
Mexico that may be selling
alcohol, but
You know, it's, it's catering to
more to lower income folks, and
if these people want to buy,
let's just say some a 6 pack of
beer or something, and it costs
more money. Are we doing
something to help these
individual businesses and
stakeholders.
In having to
comply with this new law, Madam
Chair.
Thank you, Madam Chair
Representative. Um, so as I
mentioned, the goal is not to
reinitiate prohibition. We're
talking about a, a 5 to 10%
reduction in consumption
overall, um, that said, um, the
provision allows small
distributors, I think craft
brewers, small local wineries,
small distillers in the state,
um, they are held, um, I'm
forgetting the word, but
they're, they're not gonna be.
Impacted by the increase in um
excise taxes. So they are only
going to be experiencing the
sales tax and then again because
the sales tax is based on the
cost of the alcohol, um, a, a $1
beverage would only generate 12
cents in revenue, whereas, um,
a, you know, a $100 beverage
would generate $12 in revenue.
So, um, the re
inhalers that that sell lower
cost beverages, um, would
actually be collecting fewer
dollars if, if that. Thank you
so much.
And, and thank you for that. And
I guess I think that's important
to look at probably just
Worlds and I, I, I don't know if
you said we're holding.
Smaller distillers harmless? Is
that, and then what about those
businesses that are located in
very rural areas or small
businesses, for example, Madam
Chairman.
Did you
Um, Madam Chair and members.
One of the things that we don't
normally also consider is that
with alcohol taxes and in
increased funding for prevention
and treatment services, there's
an increase in job opportunities
that are solid, that are that
provide um insurance, great pay,
and address the public health
needs. So I want, I just want to
make sure that that's
considered. And in addition to
that, we know that there's a
very small percentage of the
population that actually has
really high alcohol consumption
where we might say
alcohol use disorder, that
population normally does not
change their substance, their
consumption rates. And so, in,
in terms of the impact that
you're seeing, we're not
expecting a huge impact.
In, in that consumption from the
higher population, it's really
impacting prevent, prevention
and decreasing a moderate amount
of drinking.
Thank you.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair. And,
and I, I think it's good to look
at all those factors, right? I
think it's super important to
see, OK, well, if we invest this
and this helps 5% of the
population will affect a
majority of the population in
some way, and I think
It's good to not look at bills
just as bad, good, but look at
long-term policy implications,
so I appreciate that. I, I still
am very hesitant to, to support
uh this cause honestly I have
not read every page of your
bill, and I, it would be a
dereliction on my duty to vote
on something that
I didn't read every page and
every word, but I think it's
important to have a conversation
about, especially those rural
businesses, I think also talking
about the people who do buy
alcohol versus the people who
don't buy large quantities of
alcohol, I guess if you wanted
to a fancy bottle of Lagaulin
like you had, which I've had
before. It's very good, by the
way, but, but man, I'm sure it's
different than buying, you know,
a 6-pack of PBR.
It's so different and it's so
different the demographics that
do buy it and don't. So I think
it's, it's a, you have to put it
in perspective and I appreciate
you for bringing that.
perspective-driven approach, and
I definitely would be um
Looking forward to seeing your
bill and the actual session in
the 30 day, I'm sure it'll come
to this committee at the
government committee. So I
appreciate that, Madam Chair,
and I appreciate both of you for
having a a good presentation
today. I don't know if you had
any closing things on my
questions, but I appreciate it.
It
OK.
Oh,
please, thank you, Madam Chair
Representative. I just want to
thank you so much for your
thoughtful questions and just to
highlight that really it's the
higher income white individuals
who do most of the drinking in
New Mexico and would really be
bearing the the majority of the
costs from this, um, and I'd
welcome any further discussion,
representative block, so I
really appreciate your time
today. Thank you, Madam
committee members.
No further discussion. Do we
have a motion?
Endorsement
Do we have more a most emotion
for endorsement of this
legislation.
Oh, you made a motion.
a
Pardon me,
there is a motion on the floor
for endorsement by Vice Chair
Pinto and a second by
Representative Allison, do we
have any opposition to this
motion?
We do, so let's please call
roll.
OK, uh, let's see who's here.
I'll go through and you can give
me a yes or no vote, uh,
Representative Allison. Yes.
Uh, Representative B block. No.
Representative Little, yes.
Senator Lopez is gone.
Senator Rodriguez.
Uh, vice chair Pinto.
Cherry Johnson. Yes.
5 yeses, 1 no. Thank you. So
your legislation has been
endorsed.
Good luck. Thank you so much.
Thank you.
That's it for our agenda today,
ladies and gentlemen,
colleagues, I do want to thank
the county and tribal Health
councils for providing a
Doughnuts this morning and Drew
Sutter provided coffee and
bagels.
