Along with that, with some
additional flooding that took
place over the weekend in
Roswelle. Uh, there's quite a
bit that we have, uh, to
consider as we move forward.
And the information that will be
presented today, of course, will
help us to get a better handle
on where things happened to be
when it comes to the hermit's
Peak Caff Canyon fire, and of
course the Riodoso fires, and
then along with that, uh, some
of the other unknowns that have
been occurring, uh, primarily
because of the uh the recent
rains. I know in Las Vegas we
had uh uh quite a bit of rain
over the weekend as well.
Other members will probably hear
some of that later on, so, uh,
this is very appropriate. It's
timely. More importantly, as we
prepare over the next less than
90 days to get ready for a 60
day session. Uh, the real key is
going to be how are we going to
address these type of issues
here in New Mexico. So as you
take a look at the uh
subcommittee agenda, uh, we're
gonna be talking about the
status of the major fire
recoveries, as I mentioned, uh,
we'll be
dealing with the uh property
insurance in New Mexico, that
status and some of the reform
options.
And then lastly, with the uh
subcommittee discussion of some
of the preferences, the
thoughts, and the direction, uh
that will uh be brought forth by
the members, and then of course
with our LFC staff, the key
there is going to be how they're
gonna help us put together if
you will, some of the framework
for some of those
recommendations as we move
along.
I don't know if all the members
have a copy of the uh the
agenda, if not, it doesn't look
like uh
I see that there, so I will have
those copies, uh, brought to you
shortly. I know that uh our
staff does an excellent job in
ensuring that the agenda does go
out uh by email and so here we
go, the copies of the agenda are
gonna be there uh available to
you.
Before we uh get started with
the presentation, if the members
would briefly introduce
themselves and uh if you do have
uh something brief that you wish
to go ahead and talk about in
terms of uh how the fires and
floods have affected you, please
do that uh with your
introduction and the reason I
bring that up because I
As I look around the room and,
and, and the table of the people
that are here. I've seen you all
out there in the field, uh,
whether it be in Riodoso,
whether it be in Las Vegas, some
of the other areas, even the
Santa Fe and moving on into some
of our uh smaller communities,
so what we're gonna do is get
started and if I will, I think
I'm gonna go ahead and start uh
with my left uh representative,
please. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
My name is Debbie Sean. I
represent House District 21 in
Bernnolio County. Um,
So I, in, in Albuquerque, so
this fire, it doesn't really
affect directly me, but we did
um go and do a tour of the
Hermit's Peak not long after the
fire, so um I understand what's
happening.
Thank you. Really appreciate
that. Thank you very much,
Representative.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Harlan
Vincent. I'm the representative
out of Lincoln County District
56.
And we have been impacted quite
a bit by the fires and the
floods.
And things are moving along and
last time we all met in, in
Mescalero, we talked about
The red tape
And the red tape is so thick.
That I want to share an
algorithm with you.
When you put in for a project.
You literally have to take
about.
5 steps.
In order to to even get it going
and then you have to go to
another algorithm. And when
you're talking about 30, 40, 50
projects, it starts to wear,
wear people out.
And um,
We have lots of stuff happening
in Lincoln County.
And they're hauling a lot of
debris off and moving a lot of
debris and uh it literally looks
like an army of ants around
there, uh, there's gotta be 100
trucks and it's starting to take
shape again. It doesn't look as
devastating as it did when you
guys were there, um, for LFC.
And then
You know, I just want to mention
our friends from Chavis County.
And um,
You know, we've been praying for
rain. I just, I don't know if we
didn't pray for the right
amount. It came pretty fast.
And uh,
You know, there was reports of
I've heard 6 inches, I've heard
8 inches.
In like an hour.
So, um, lots of devastation over
there and Chavis County was real
good to Lincoln County, and they
showed up to help us, and I know
right before I left.
People were are Lincoln County
was starting to head to Chavis
County to start helping them
with food and all the things
that they need, so.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Representative Vincent, I really
appreciate those remarks and a
couple of things that you
brought to light there, uh,
number one, of course, the roads
because of the uh the heavy
trucks, the vehicles that are on
those roads. The other aspect
is, so where is the debris, uh,
being placed, and I know that uh
is a big concern in your area,
particularly with trucks hauling
uh a lot of the debris into some
of the.
Places that are that are farther
away, so there might be the need
to look a little bit closer to,
to your county and of course to
the area, uh, our hearts go out
to you and to the people there.
I know you've continued to go
ahead and be a very strong
individual bringing forth, if
you will, the need for
rehabilitation and trying to get
People back to
Some level of normalcy.
Representative Chatfield.
Thank you, Mr. Jared Jack
Chatfield.
Uh, state representative
District 67, Colfax Curry
Harding Quke, San Miguel and
Union County, which chairman.
My uh
Our son and daughter-in-law had
traveled to Rosville for the
NMI, uh,
annual get together.
And they spent the night on top
of their car,
uh.
Very uh
Terrible flooding down there
and, and like I say, there were
other people in town for the.
NMMI reunion and, and uh so.
Uh, it certainly had an effect
on us.
Um,
It rained at my house a lot, but
I live in the sandy ocean.
And it, it didn't.
didn't harm anything it helped.
Helped to put some, some water
down.
Uh, my heart goes out to the
folks that, that were negatively
affected by the fires, by the
floods.
Uh, we traveled to the Calf
Canyon and um
Hermits peak fire.
Before the last session, we
appropriated $100 million to
help in that in that instance
because we
Believe that the state of New
Mexico's red tape is a little
easier to get through than the
federal government.
And I, I truly hope and pray
that that that that has been
true that our help got there
when it was needed.
And uh we need to look and see
what's, what more is needed
there and in these other places.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Uh, thank
you very much, uh,
Representative Chad Fielder.
We move forward and I really
appreciate that because we saw
you there from the very onset,
uh, in the more Las Vegas area
and you've been very concerned
about the entire state as we've
dealt with it, so we, we truly
appreciate that and uh you've,
you've been there with us ever
since the onset. Again, we thank
you very much and moving along
to our chairman Small, uh,
I know that this is weighing
heavy on your heart as well as
you've been dealing with it
statewide and uh thinking about
how this is going to be put
together, if you will, as we
come up with recommendations for
the upcoming sessions, so, uh,
if you will, please, as I
indicated, introduce yourself
and then make a a few opening
remarks, so the public is paying
attention to this normally the
enormity and the severity of
what we're dealing with
throughout the state. Thank you.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
Um, I'm proud to represent.
House District 36, which is down
in Donana County, um, very
aware, uh, increasingly of the
risk that really all parts of
our state face uh as our climate
changes, um, been really um
Uh,
Privileged to be with
Representative Chatfield and
other members, yourself, uh,
Senator Woods, and many others
in seeing the on the ground
effects from Herman's Peak, Calf
Canyon, recently in Riodoso with
Representative Vincent who's
been great about bringing us
together to see um the enormity
of our challenge and for us to
be in a stronger fiscal position
and hopefully in a collaborative
sort of policy science, uh, and
state position.
To the uh the best partner and
what will be increasingly
challenging times for sure for
the mountainous parts of our
state, but also I think
increasingly we see sort of um
Catastrophic risk, whether it's
from flooding, fire.
For the combination thereof and
uh is it will be felt across all
parts of our state, so we have
to come up with new and better
and stronger ways to
collaboratively address it.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you very much, uh,
Chairman Small and to the people
again that are online.
Uh, these people have been with
us since the onset as we've
dealt with the pandemic and
dealing with the fires and the
floods throughout the state.
Um, Chairman Small has been
there in Las Vegas. He's been
with us, uh, boots on the
ground, as they say, and we
really appreciate that and he
continues to.
Uh, think about ways that we can
have those resources available,
uh, which reminds me as so we
just got word that I understand
that there's been uh $1000 if
you will, in emergency
resources, uh,
Appropriated, if you will, to
the Roswell situation, possibly
more to come, and we'll probably
hear more about that, uh.
As the days go along. Again,
these are the serious issues
that we're dealing with.
Uh, Representative Lujan,
please.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
uh Representativeana represent
House District 48 here in Santa
Fe, um, like many of us, I've
been just very um.
on the ground and in the air
when it's regarding um.
The fires and emergency
responses that we've we've seen
through our um state and one of
the biggest concerns that we
have, and I know Elisa is on top
of this is, what does this mean
for the future, um.
We know that
To climate change that we're
going to be seeing more of
these, these type of emergency,
um.
Disaster, um, scenarios, Mr.
Chair, it's not a matter.
if it's going to happen and the
occurrences are going to be more
frequent.
So this is a huge and very
important conversation we need
to have for our state, um.
Seeing where we already are now
and some of the things that
we're faced with, um, this is
extremely important and I'm
happy to be here today I have
the time to be here for this
conversation. Thank you. Thank
you very much, Representative,
and again, uh, in your previous
roles, you're very familiar with
that part of the area that has
been adversely affected the
Hermit's peak Caf Canyon area
and of course the Mota area and
you've been a strong advocate,
uh, here in this area to uh
continue to help us as we move
forward and we appreciate that.
Senator Woods, please.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
My name is Pat Woods. I
represent Curriquean Union.
Counties
Uh, we've had pretty good rains
over our area.
Much, much requested rain, I
might add.
We, uh, haven't had the
Blurting that's happened in
Riodosa. I did talk to.
Uh, Senator Neibert.
Uh, today, and he told me about.
Some of the
Huge water that came through
that part of the country and it
was just devastating.
Uh, cars floating around.
Two deaths that we know of.
Uh
He said there were some houses
that the walls.
They filled up with water and
the walls just gave away.
Uh, some of those houses are.
I've been in that country for a
long time.
And for it to happen.
What it did is, is very unusual
times and
I am so happy that you uh call
this particular subcommittee.
Because a real thing that's
going on today is, is how do we
Nope.
Our citizens
With the many insurance problems
that this stuff brings.
And I know that it's been said
in the past that
That the uh the flood in the
fire.
It's terrible for houses.
But the biggest losses have been
through the hail insurance and.
In the severe weather.
It's happened also.
So these are catastrophes that
we hope that we can.
Keep a lot of competition in the
insurance companies and and.
Have them
Stay in our state to serve the,
the people in our state because
without that, we can't mortgage
a house.
And, and that's
That devastates our our housing
industry if we.
Let that happen. So those are
some of the things that I'm
thinking about.
Um,
It's very hard to spin.
Federal money, very hard to
spend state money.
Uh, I hear that over and over
and over.
We put those safeguards in.
Uh, to kind of keep a little of
the
Corruption out, we hope,
but many things we ask for.
For reimbursements or, or
further
Proof,
but it's hard, especially when
you have 40 and 50 claims coming
in.
At a time.
And, and just a a burden of
paperwork.
So, uh,
You know, we pray for all those
in need right now.
Uh, and we pray that we can come
together.
With some legitimate.
Answers to some prayers.
As far as state government and
how we can make life.
Easier in our on our citizens.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank
you very much, Senator Woods,
and you've been there with us as
well as we've uh worked through
so many of these ordeals and I
uh would like to just stress to
people as a citizen, uh
legislature.
We continued to move forward and
coming from small communities
from one end of the state and
traveling to the other to uh
personally view what uh
travesties have occurred.
Um, we're talking about the
insurance we're talking about
people's health, we're talking
about uh the loss of property
and so many of these things,
but, uh, from a representative
uh Srian all the way through to
uh Representative Lujan, but
we're hearing here today is uh
from the personal experiences
from our own observations we see
so much that we've gone through
and we want to best prepare, if
you will, to deal with these
situations because it's our uh
people's lives.
That definitely are at stake and
more importantly, uh, how we're
gonna continue to improve the
quality and
New Mexico lives or New Mexican
lives, so, moving along, uh,
Senator Gonzalez, please.
Thank you all, Mr. Chairman, and
good afternoon to all of you, to
our audience, and everyone
that's here.
Um,
I'm Roberto Babija Gonzalez. I
represent Senate District 6,
part of Los Alamos Riariba,
Santa Fe and Taos.
Uh, Mr. Chairman, uh, uh,
Me, so this is a very sensitive
to me.
And um
In way as a younger person, I
fought many fires.
And I can see uh the behavior
and how this works and for many
years, you know, uh, when you
have fire and when you have
flood.
It can be just as equal, you
know, as far as the potential of
damage and the potential of
harm.
And uh for many years, I have
always thought about this and I
have had some discussions.
Is that um as a state, we just
really need to get a stronger
foundation.
To be prepared, you know, for,
for this um incident.
And uh for many years as um we
would have a fire.
And we would talk about it, it'd
be on the news and then little
by little we keep forgetting and
it's gone.
And, you know, so it's like put
away.
But I think those days are gone.
I think that we really have to
come up with a.
Uh, something that is constant
and the information and uh solid
research, solid work, solid
commitment to the funding, and
so when it does happen, as we
have been experiencing more and
more.
You know, we're right there, you
know, we don't have to wait
until.
A plan or wait until something
else to push it forward.
So with this, um, Mr. Chairman,
I know that uh we have made some
uh big strides. I know, for
example, um.
On the hotshot firefighters that
was established um to have the
big units, one in Las Vegas and
one for uh Socorro.
And uh in my opinion, we
probably need like 6 of those
within the state.
Then uh the same thing now
dressing with um.
How do we handle when we do have
uh something like this.
Downpours of rain that we have
had to work with, so, uh, Mr.
Chairman, I be uh listening and
um.
Also uh taking uh at a very high
value, everyone's comments to
this conversation.
As we go forward. Thank you.
Thank you very much, Senator
Gonzalez, and uh.
Want to thank you as well,
because from the onset as these
fires started uh there in the
Hermit's peak Cf Canyon area,
your phone calls and your
concern for people in home and
uh Mota and that whole area and
uh your assistance coming from
that part of the state, uh, Tows
County and, and uh the
surrounding area definitely.
Helped us to get through it, not
only morally, but as you
continue to help us make these
phone calls so that we'd be able
to uh work right alongside those
people that were fighting the
fires and your expertise
definitely has been welcomed and
very much appreciated.
I'd like to go next to uh our
chairman, uh representative uh
Lenty. I think he's on.
Online and if you would
representative if you could just
share uh of course, introduce
yourself and share a few of your
thoughts. You've been a good
guiding light for me as we have
continued this in and I
appreciate your guidance as
well.
Uh, thank you very much,
Chairman, uh, Representative Ny
Uh, thank you very much,
Chairman, uh, Representative for
those remarks, I'm going to our
LFC director Charles Sly for um
a few brief remarks, but more
than that, he's been with us
ever since the onset and helping
us to deal directly with
So many of the issues, the
aftermath as we go forward and
he keeps us as members of the
legislature are very much
informed in terms of.
The travesties and how we can
find ways to deal with this. So
if you may, uh,
Um, director Cly share with us a
few thoughts and introduce your
staff that's gonna be working
with us throughout this
committee process if you will as
well.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So we
have Emily and Scott Sanchez,
Emily Hilla and Scott Sanchez.
Um, who will be working.
On this particular topic in
terms of the fire response, and
this is really intended to help
inform you what's the current
status of
The funds that you've
appropriated, what worked, uh,
what were potential challenges
that we need to be aware of if,
if we're going to respond in
this way.
Uh, going forward in in the
future.
And then we'll have an agenda
topic on
Uh, where we need to go in terms
of uh our insurance crisis and
those particular issues.
Um, a little bit later in
Julissa Rodriguez will be your
LFC staff.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Uh, thank you very much,
Director Clea, and again, I want
to also thank uh the LFC
chairman, Senator George Munoz,
who has been there with us also
as we move forward and dealing
directly with these issues and
thank you all for not only
coming up with the topics, uh,
but, uh, helping us to form the
subcommittee and helping us as
we prepare if you will, for uh
how to continue to handle these
issues that uh definitely face
New Mexico.
At this point, as we go forward,
I'd ask the presenters to
introduce yourself and then uh
however you wish to handle the
presentation, uh, please begin
and ask the members if you will,
um, hold your questions till the
end of the presentation and then
uh we'll go to those questions
and then after move on to the
next topic.
Thank you.
Thank you and good afternoon,
Mr. Chair and members of the
committee.
My name is Cecilia Mavramatis,
and I'm joined here today by our
deputy director, Jeannette
Gallegos. I am the new division
director for local government,
so.
Um, it's great to see you all
again. I have been before you a
few times, so I, I look forward
to working on these projects
with you all.
Um, in front of you, you do have
a packet that was passed out and
you will have 3 items that we'll
be going over today.
Um, of those items, one of them
is a progress report memorandum
that is dated for July 5th. This
did go out. This will provide
you a little more context of
what projects um were supported
with some of these funds and
some more granular detail to
what we're going to go over on
our two high-level documents.
The other two documents that we
have are the one pager for the
$100 million for Hermit's Peak
Calf Canyon Fire Recovery,
otherwise known as Senate Bill
6.
And the second document you have
for one page is the $700 million
for salt and South Fork recovery
House Bill One.
I will begin with the $100
million for the Hermit Peaks Caf
Canyon Fire Recovery, Sneel 6.
And I'll give you all a second
to sort those those documents.
Um.
I am joined today by the
Institutional knowledge that is
our deputy director Jeanette
Gallegos. So I will briefly go
over the summary of this. Um,
however, some of the details to
those projects will um be
answered by our deputy director.
The New Mexico Department of
Finance and Administration is in
partnership with the Department
of Homeland Security Emergency
Management and awarded $99.6
million in zero interest loans
to local governments.
Um, these funds will support the
replacement and repair of public
infrastructure damaged by the
her Hermit's Peak Ca Canyon
Fire, as well as flooding and
debris flows that followed. The
loans were made possible through
Hermit's Peakcalf Canyon Fire
Recovery Bill, Senate Bill 6,
which did provide $100 million
appropriation in the 2023
legislative session.
It is important to note that
also these loans were
distributed on an average of 2
to 3 days from the date the
executed loan agreement was
received at the local government
division of DFA.
Um, for further details on those
awarded projects, I will turn it
over to uh Ms. Gallegos.
Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr.
Chair, members of the committee.
So on the right side of that
document, we have the timeline
for the events that occurred,
um, coming, starting with the
signing of the bill.
In February of
February 20th, 2023, Senate Bill
6 was signed by the Governor
Lujan Grisham.
On March 8th of that same year,
DFA sent letters to 8 eligible
political subdivisions regarding
the upcoming loan process.
The loan application and loan
agreements were finalized on.
Uh, March 24th.
Of 2023.
And on March 30th, DFA and DHSEM
conducted a joint application
webinar.
On
April 12th.
Uh, GFA and DHSEM, we went in
person and we did some in-person
workshops, so we went to Mota
County and we went to City of
Las Vegas and we met in person
with them to
Uh, present the loan process and
also answer any questions they
may have.
On May 25th.
Of 2023, we received the first
loan application from um.
In total, San Miguel County
applied for a total of 5
projects.
Uh, totaling 41.2 million.
On May 26th, we received a first
loan at the first loan
application from Mota County.
And in total, Mota County
applied for 8 projects.
I'm sorry, what account you
applied for 5 projects and Sam
Miguel applied for a a little
mixed.
Um, and so, uh, Mota County.
Total is 41.2 million in San
Miguel County is 34.3 million.
For those 8 projects.
On April 19th of 2024.
We received our first loan
application from the city of Las
Vegas.
The city of Las Vegas applied
for a total of 3 projects, uh,
totaling 22.6 million.
On June 25th, 2024, we've
received a loan application from
uh Mota Mutual domestic Water
Consumer Association.
For a little over $1000.
And on June 26th, we received
our final loan application from
the Aquapura Water Association,
and that was for $500,000.
So those are the awards that
have been made for Senate Bill
6.
Uh, the total for the awards are
99.6 million. To date, we have
received 7, a little over
7,003,000 in repayment.
Mr. Chair, um, would you like us
to continue on to the hospital
one and or do you want to stop
here? Uh, if you would please
that way we can go through all
of the portions of your
presentation and then we'll go
to the questions. Thank you.
Absolutely. Moving on to our
next slide for the 70 million
for Salton South Fork Fire
Recovery.
Um, again, we have DFA in
partnership with DHSCM and we
have awarded the $70 million in
zero interest loans to local
governments to repair to repair
or replace in public
infrastructures damaged by fire,
flooding, or debris caused by or
stemming from the sal salt and
South Fork fires. These awards
uh represent the allocation from
House Bill 1 of the 2024 special
session.
And this, um, there were
This was approached a little
differently than the last in
that saying that the loans were
dispersed at 50% of the awarded
amount um prior to the FEMA
determination of a level 4, we
can get into details if we need
to for that. Um, I do believe
you will have some of that in
your progress report.
Um, and I'll give it over to our
deputy director to go over those
projects with you all.
OK. So to summarize this
timeline, uh, hospital bill one
was signed by Governor Luhan
Grisham on July 30th of 2024.
On April 9th, DFA sent letters
to the 6 eligible political
subdivisions.
Um, regarding the loan process.
On April 21st of 2024, uh, DFA
and DHSEM, we went to the
village of Riodoso and we had an
in-person workshop.
With representatives of all six.
Um, eligible entities.
On September 5th, we received a
loan application from Lincoln
County in the amount of 26
million.
On September 6th, we received a
loan application from the
village of Riodoso in the amount
of 193.3 million.
Um,
On September 13th, the loan
agreements were issued and
executed.
And on September 17th, 50% of
those awards were dispersed to
both Lincoln County and Village
Riodoso. So to clarify um
although uh villager Rio Doo
applied for 193, they received
the remaining balance of the
$700 million. And Mr. Chair, I
think the last remaining
document is that progress report
memorandum that does detail
additional special projects, um,
that for the most part concludes
the two.
one pager, I, I understand that
there is far more conversation
than what is on and detailed on
one page of paper for both of
these instances, um, however,
there are going to be times
where we need to defer to DHSCM
to answer some of the management
and, and the boots on the ground
aspects to that. So, but with
that, Mr. Chair, we'll stand for
any questions.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Uh,
You know, when we went in
And looked at the calf canyon
Hermit's Peak fire. The feds
said they took 100%
responsibility and that they
would pay for it and we
appropriated the 100 million to
get the
Get the wheels rolling. And you
said something at the end there
about repayment, um, and I
didn't catch it. So where do we
stand as far as the Fed's
responsibility to repay the
state on those loan.
So Mr. Chair and Representative
Chatfield, um,
The the funding was, is used to
provide gap funding for the
local governments so that they
could get the projects completed
while they're waiting so that
they can then submit for
reimbursement through FEMA.
So what has been submitted for
reimbursement to FEMA has been
paid at this point. Um, it's my
understanding that there is some
delay in procurement on the
projects and therefore the the
projects have not been completed
and have not been submitted for
reimbursement at this time for
hermits B Calf Canyon.
Uh, thank you Mr. Chair, how,
how much was that? How much has
been?
Submitted
A total of 703.
$626.90. Wonderful. So the, the
process is going as as expected.
Uh,
Maybe a tiny bit of a rabbit
trail. I hope not too much of
one, but uh when this fire
was burning
How many executive orders?
This can be anybody that
Once to answer it, did the
governor
Have to do to give us the money
to put that fire out.
Mr. Chair, uh Representative
Chatfield, we do not have that
number for how many executive
orders, so we'd be more than
happy to get that. I believe it
was multiple executive orders
daily.
that, uh.
Because of the, of the limit
that an executive order has on
it.
Uh, that, that can be a very
efficient way to fight fire. I
think we need to
Consider
This is gonna be the tie-in, Mr.
Chair. When this money is paid
back to us.
Uh, by the feds.
Maybe we ought to put a fund
there.
That can be accessed.
By our firefighters.
After a certain amount of time,
possibly approval by the
legislature, which is the
appropriating arm of the
government, right?
So we need to have some money
there.
Fight fire. We know we're gonna
have fire.
Uh, there should be a fund
there.
It just
It's accessible.
And it should require a little
bit of a nod by the legislature.
Uh, in due time after, you know,
it ought to be available to get
the wheels rolling right away.
And uh
And so
On our to do list, hopefully we
will.
But
Put together something like
that.
Next, the
The, uh,
Salt and south fork fires.
They also received loans to the
various communities and stuff to
repair their stuff. I don't know
that the federal government took
responsible for those fires and,
and agreed to make them whole.
So are they gonna have to just
be left holding the bag to pay
this money back or is the state
gonna help them a little bit on
this, uh?
Where are we at on that?
Uh, uh, Mr. Chair and
Representative Chatfield, I
believe because there was a
emergency, uh.
Declaration declared there the
FEMA FEMA is working with those
entities and with DHSCM
currently, so those projects
that were submitted to us for
this loan.
Um, has also been submitted to
FEMA for review of the project
costs. So those will be um
reimbursed as well.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Jeff.
That was, that makes me feel
better.
Uh, thank you very much,
Representative Chatfield, and
we'll have uh many of these
recommendations, of course, that
will be studied and prepared, if
you will, and considered over
the next several months. But
again, thank you very much for
those recommendations. Moving on
to Senator Woods. Senator Woods,
please. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Again, I'm gonna pull from my
memory, which is pretty cloudy
at times.
So
way I remember it, FEMA uh took
a lot of responsibility for the
Hermit's Caff Canyon fires
because
Of the
Prescribed burns up in that
country that got away so they
took a lot more.
Buy in
For those two fires and uh.
I, I'm still getting a lot of
femur.
Uh, feedback on that about, uh,
they're still taking
applications and they're still
trying to make settlements up
there.
Uh, many of them, I think with
private individuals.
Up in that country if I'm not
mistaken. Um
We
But it's not the same case.
On the South and South for.
River.
So FEMA, FEMA is, is doing two
separate things.
Well, as far as the private
damage.
Uh,
On the 21, they're not claiming,
not they're not spending any
money on.
On the private damages. Am I
getting this right?
And is that kind of the general
context.
So Mr. Chair and Senator Woods,
I, I'm not.
Um, exactly sure exactly what
the difference is between the
two from the FEMA standpoint,
um, what I can tell you that I
do know is that there was a
difference in the fact that for
the emergency watershed
protection program, um,
For the Herbert's Peak Caf
Canyon Fire, uh, the federal
government has waived the um the
the match requirement because
they were um they have claimed
responsibility for that fire.
For the salt and South Fork
fires, they have not waived that
match, um, and so there I
believe there is a 25% match
that was required for for that
um for that assistance. Now,
those are the emergency
watershed protection programs as
as it relates to the actual
claims through FEMA. Um, I, I'm
not.
I'm not, um, I don't have that
answer and we would have to
probably check with DHSEM and
get back to you on that one. And
I think I'm talking more about
The private claims.
And not, not the public claims
that.
That uh the matching dollars.
That you're talking about.
Um,
I know that state government
can't make any.
Direct loans or direct payments
to a private individual without.
Circling through some agency and
And it's, it's mostly about
Public projects and public
bridges and roads and.
You know, and, and again, Mr.
Chair, I wanna
I want to brag on the Mexico DOT
a little.
Um, they went in there and they
did a huge amount of clean up
work.
Uh
you know,
they, uh.
They, they put a lot of
Their budgets.
In there.
Uh, to help people get
The roads where they could get
in and do their properties.
And uh help these counties a
lot.
And, and cleaned up some.
Some ditches so that the waters
could flow and help.
With all the, the flooding
that's going on. Um,
Are we
And, and this is a very specific
question and you may not know
the answer to, but I know Las
Vegas had a temporary uh water.
Uh, cleaning.
Filtration system in place and
understood they were trying to
get a permanent system in place.
And, and maybe it's a question
for the chairman instead of, of
you guys, but I was just
wondering.
Where we're standing on that for
public water supply.
Of Las Vegas.
So Mr. Chair and Senator Woods,
um, I do know that the city of
Las Vegas applied for a
temporary filtration system.
You said those 6 funds and they
were awarded um a little over
5.6 million.
Um, as to the status of that
project, I, I don't have those
answers, um, but they were
awarded some funding for that.
OK. So the, the last thing.
You know, is, is, uh,
Many times we talk about.
About climate change and, and
changes that's happening.
But, you know,
Years for years now, we've been
seeing.
The force with these uh mark
beetles and things killing trees
up there in the forest and, and
You know, there, there's
Great pushback.
On the public for
Spring pesticides to and might
kill some of these beetles and
save some of our trees that way.
And so sometimes it's, it's hard
to
To say what's the perfect
solution for anything.
But we all know that we, we put
a whole lot of
Kindling up there that's dead,
that's, that's.
That uh we need to
Figure out a better way.
To uh to bend those forces in
what we're doing.
So, and I know that's not the
state show. I know that.
But that's a federal issue.
And we have so much federal
lands in our state that it's,
it's pretty scary, but when we
start talking about trying to
help people because so many of
those private properties are up
there surrounding.
A national forest and
And even if those private
properties do their best to
limit.
They're, you know, do their
trimming, doing their cleaning
and and different things. It's
still.
That heat comes so close to your
property.
It's pretty hard for it to.
To protect your
Particular improvements in that.
So, uh,
I don't know what the solution
to that is. I just want to bring
it up that
But
We, you know, prescribed burns
are fine.
But
It needs to be a continual
operation in those federal and
of course those prescribed burns
need to really watch as we can
tell.
How, how we do that. And again,
The next presentation I'm, I'm
looking forward to.
On the the insurance part of
that.
Because we are.
We are just putting
Our citizens at risk here.
And at risk of not being able to
get insurance and.
There again
Doing away with their mortgage
insurance and mortgage banker
will not loan that.
Without insurance.
So Mr. Chair, I know that I'm
rambling. I appreciate the
opportunity. Thank you very
much, sir.
Uh, thank you very much, Senator
Woods, and again, uh, valuable
points that are brought to the
forefront as we deal with this.
A few things.
Number one is we all go forward
and I know it's difficult, but
as soon as possible if we can
have an update in terms of the
uh itemized issues that we are
addressing and uh it's more for
the general public so that they
have that confidence in us as we
move forward and they understand
that.
All agencies have taken this
very seriously and it's
something that we're working
through.
And the points that have already
been brought up definitely lead
to that. We want to ensure that
the resources that have been
authorized and are being
distributed or being properly
used.
And we want that breakdown and
then at the same time as we move
forward.
Uh, I know there are other
things that are definitely
occurring in fact right now in
Las Vegas, uh, the FEMA, uh,
stakeholder roundtable uh is
being held and that's, I
believe, on a monthly basis, and
that gives the people in that
area the update, but working
very closely, of course, with
yourselves as we move forward,
um, it behooves us all to try to
get this information uh brought
forward so that when we do get
ready for the session, if there
are some issues that
We need to address, at least
we're able to go ahead and look
at policy as well as the uh the
authorized amounts that it will
take to continue to help us
through some of these uh uh.
Unfortunate situations as we
deal with it.
Uh, moving along then, we're
gonna be going to Senator
Gonzalez, then we'll go to
Representative Vincent. Senator
Gonzalez, please.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just
have a couple of things and a
little bit in line with uh
Senator Wood's.
So, well, we be getting a report
on individual and private.
Requests that have done for.
Assistance
Um, Mr. Chair and Senator
Gonzalez, we don't have
information on those private
entities that do request
assistance. Um, I believe maybe
DHSCM might have that
information for you, but what we
can provide an itemized list for
is that infrastructure money
that was approved through both
of these um appropriations.
You know, Mr. Chairman, uh, the
only reason that I bring this up
is um.
Well, first of all, it's a very
valid reason, but.
Uh, from time to time we hear in
the media, in fact, this
morning.
And the television they had
about.
What percentage?
That have not applied.
And, and my question is, so.
Is there something missing why
they have not applied or they
just don't want to be helped.
Or maybe the outreach has to be
changed too.
But it said, and then they
always come up with deadlines.
There's always a deadline, but.
Uh, back this morning, they just
had or um.
Uh, percentage of families that
have not applied to me the
question is why? That is my
part, Mr. Chairman.
Uh, thank you very much, Senator
Gonzalez, as we move forward,
Representative Vincent, please.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And I really appreciate your,
your report here.
And one thing I wanted to know.
So, I'm gonna tell you thank you
again for, have you seen your
algorithm that you put together
for Lincoln County.
Uh, that talks about the process
on how we spend money.
So the
If you don't have one, I, I've
got one that I'm looking at
right here.
And
We appreciate everybody from DFA
to DHSEM to the legislators, to
the senators that helped us get
HB one passed and get some money
to our, our folks.
I've never really had a problem
spending my own money.
But when you spend state money.
It is complicated.
And the only thing that I would
like to bring up is.
When you start in the first box,
FEMA public assistant eligible
applicant completes recovery
scoping meeting. Now,
I mentioned that this this this
morning.
Have you ever seen a cow looking
at a new gate?
That's what happens whenever you
put this document in front of
someone that has a stack of
project worksheets like that.
Now,
I, I always ask people to put
yourself
In the county's positions and
then the village's positions.
And when you get ready to spend
money.
If you're the procurement
person, and I've worked with
procurement people for 25 years
whenever I worked for the
village.
And they're hardcore, and you
better have every T crossed,
every I dotted, or you're not
getting no money because the
boss does not want audit
findings and everything has to
be legit.
Then you move over.
And then DHSEM and the applicant
formulate a FEMA PA eligible
project.
Do you know how hard it is to
get?
Engineers
The engineer projects.
And I think we have a shortage.
And I just got back, Mr.
Chairman from Texas.
And I, I, I as well love our
DOT.
But whenever I was in Texas,
They, their roads are
illuminated with all kinds of
reflectors and their signage and
Anyway,
Going back over.
Then you go to the next box.
Now, there is 123.
456789 10 boxes.
There's more boxes on spending
money than there is in the ACLS.
Algorithm to save somebody from
a heart attack.
This is more complicated than
saving somebody from a heart
attack.
And I would just ask that maybe.
If you could possibly reach out
to counties.
And municipalities.
And cut that in half.
And my question is on this
algorithm.
Do they have to do this process
for every single project.
Mr. Chairman.
Uh, Mr. Chair and Representative
Vincent, um, I believe what has
complicated the process even
further is the fact that these
are, um, it is FEMA.
Reimbursable projects and so
they have to go through a
federal, federal requirements
for the procurement, which is
added to the
The state procurement even more
so, um.
I don't have an answer as to
what can be cut out of that
process. I believe that that
would be a good discussion to
have with DHSCM and FEMA.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and so
back to this algorithm.
I'm not gonna read every box off
to you.
But by the time you get through
every one of these boxes, you
have probably brought in.
5 to 6 different agencies that
have to talk to each other.
You know how hard it is for
agencies to talk to each other.
And then it almost gets to the
point you're like, oh my
goodness, what am I gonna do?
How am I gonna get this project
going because these, these
village managers and these
county managers.
In my area, I know that when
they want something done, they
want it to get done.
And then
When they start with this
algorithm.
It's not that we're not getting
stuff done. It takes forever to
get something done.
And then meanwhile, the
community is chewing their rears
because they don't think that
they're trying to get anything
done, but they really are.
And you know, I'm sitting here
looking at uh the county and
Lincoln County's got 26 million
that, you know, in projects.
Um, 44 million to the village,
but they wrote $193.3 million
worth of projects, so.
I'm just trying to tee up Mr.
Chairman.
What do we do when we run out of
money?
Because I used to think $1000
was a lot of money.
2 years ago whenever I first
joined the legislature, 100
million.
I'm kind of snobby now at 100
million cause it doesn't get you
very far.
And when we run out of money,
Mr. Chairman, we're still not
made whole, our, our, our places
are not made whole, and um,
So there's that and then I, I
just wanted to talk about
Uh,
representative Chatfield talked
about the, the 100 million that
could possibly be paid back from
the feds and put into a fund to
combat fire because of the
I call it a climate shift. I
don't really call it climate
change, but the climate shift
that we've had versus
The management that we manage
our forests in.
And I think that the reason that
we're having all these intense
fires around the state is
because we are not doing a great
job at managing our forest.
From the state to the feds.
And, and I don't mean it's, they
just don't have the funding.
And, and
Ladies and gentlemen that are
listening,
We're either gonna pay for it on
the front or we're gonna pay for
it at the end.
When we lose everything and
everybody has to go through so
much devastation, so that, that
100 million that gets that
you're talking about
representative Chatfield to
start this fund.
I sure hope we start a fund to
thin as well.
And I'd like to see that really
start building up a bunch of
money, so that when we're
kicking money out to our
mountainous communities around
the state.
We're giving them more money
than they can cut trees down.
Just start cutting.
And with our, with our um
Hotshot crews that we've put on,
hopefully those hotshot crews
will be able to move around the
state and do project work and,
and fin and stuff like that. So
thank you, Mr. Chair.
Uh, thank you very much, uh,
Representative Vincent, uh, to
the individuals that are online,
especially if uh we have some
there from Rioso Lincoln County.
I know that uh Maura San Miguel
County, uh, they're possibly in
that uh uh stakeholder update
meeting there in Las Vegas. But
if there's anyone online who
wishes to comment or to offer
recommendations or even just uh
the progress of the work that's
going on in their communities,
uh, or their
Counties, we'd appreciate that.
I'll give it.
Couple of seconds, see if
there's anyone that uh raises
their hand or wishes to go ahead
and participate in
In this discussion, please uh
feel free to do so.
OK, so we have one, go ahead and
uh uh identify yourself and uh
make your comments, please.
Not a problem. We really
appreciate your recommendations,
your thoughts, and of course,
sharing part of your story, Mr.
Camp. Uh, it means a lot to us.
I understand that the water
natural Resources Committee will
also be in the Riodoso area on
the 28th and 29th, and this is
gonna be one of the specific
topics and so we'll continue to
have legislators that will go
and they'll uh take that
firsthand observation of what's
occurred uh in that area and how
we can continue, if you will, to
To, to assist you and the people
in that area. I understand we
have one more who is uh online
and if you will, please, um,
Identify yourself and make your
statement, please.
Thank you all very much and we
do have some responses from our
DFF personnel that are here. So
I'm gonna turn to them and let
them respond. They have some,
uh, thoughts and ideas in terms
of what we can do as we move
forward and we'll do that. And
then I'm gonna go back one more
time very quickly to see if
there are any other questions
for members of the subcommittee.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, members of
the committee and those that
have spoken, um, and contributed
to the conversation that is much
needed. Um, I, I agree, Mr.
Chair. Representative Chatfield
and Representative Vincent have
Hit the nail on the head in a
lot of ways. You have the
federal government, you have the
state, and then you have the
local entity and everyone has
expressed autonomy and then we
throw a stack of papers and we
expect everyone to figure it
out.
Not just that, um, we're talking
resources. Resources aren't
going to be the same between
every local public body. We
understand that we can host as
many conferences as humanly
possible, but sometimes it takes
meeting them in those areas and
sitting with them and walking
them through those things and um
to that, I also say, you know,
my, my cell phone, or phone
number, our website.
Please, please call me, um,
email, look whoever you need to
on our website. Um, if we need
to be there, we'll be there.
We'll, we'll, we'll meet you
where you are. Um, a big thing
to kind of highlight in this
discussion is DFA has requested
an emergency fund this year in
our capital outlay. Um, we
recognize that we need to get
the money up front. It can take
a very long time and when it's
an emergency, we don't have time
to wait for um appropriations
and for FEMA and.
For all of these resources to
get to them. Um, so we hope that
this will in some way bridge the
gap a little quicker,
understanding that we still have
that a little bit of a
disconnect between the
deliverance of money and the the
action to money. Um, the other
thing, because watershed was
brought up a few times in this
conversation, uh, I think a big
thing that just happened within
the last week and we've been
sending emails out to our state
entities as well as some of our
local entities. Uh, we just
worked with
Um, GSD to get a statewide price
agreement for water restoration
contractors. There's about 30, I
believe, vendors on that
statewide price agreement and I
understand right now it might
sound like a foreign language,
but simply put that watershed
agreement will allow these local
entities to buy services
directly off of this list
without having to do the whole
RFP and contract and do all the
additional legwork that usually
takes them a really long time
and don't have the resources to.
So we
that this is a good example and
it and it's successful so that
we can do more statewide price
agreements so that our local
public bodies can get services
out there through this, you
know, one stop shop is
essentially what we're aiming
for, um, but it's only been a
week, so I hope it is
successful, but Mr. Chair, um,
Members of the committee and,
and those who have spoken up, I,
I greatly, we, we greatly
appreciate this conversation and
we look forward to, to
continuing the conversation.
Thank you. We, we really
appreciate that. I'm gonna go
back around if there's any uh
comments that uh we still need
to go and make or there's some
thoughts that are uh wanting to
be shared, I want to go to
Representative Vincent,
Represent Vincent, please.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I,
I appreciate you saying that.
We always think about, you know,
when we have an emergency.
What did we do good and what
could we do better?
And 11 thing that we could do
better.
And um I don't know how much you
guys like to travel around the
state, but whenever there is an
emergency, I would love to see
BFA go to that town, that
municipality, that county, and
have
For a lack of better words, a
concierge service.
That you could just be there and
and make sure that we're doing
everything right and, and maybe
even have one on one trainings
with our procurement people
because I know that they're,
they're on the line too. They
wanna do everything right and I
think that with a little bit of
guidance and assurance that
you're there and it makes, you
know, you'd be like a warm
safety blanket there just right
there with them. So thank you,
Mr. Chairman.
Uh, thank you very much,
Representative. Any other, uh,
00 yes, OK, we're gonna be going
to our chairman in a moment
before I do that though. OK.
Uh, German small place.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and
actually, I, I just wanted to
remember when we were up in Las
Vegas and we took the watershed
tour last year. It was such a
moving moment you uh the piece
of burn wood that you um.
You, you, you're being on the
ground and working and on the
watershed restoration side, uh,
sort of the, a bit of a light
about how we mitigate these. I,
I want very much um celebrate
your leadership in that area.
Uh, Mr. Sher my uh director
remember Mattis, thank you, um.
The, I guess, one, I'd love if
uh I see that Laura our, our
forestry director is here.
Um,
And I'll just ask a as we get to
that, um, I was struck by Mayor
Crawford's comments, um, how do
we work with communities. So
it's not just sort of a disaster
to disaster recovery, and you
mentioned sort of a request for
a disaster fund.
But I heard, I think we all
heard from Mayor Crawford,
beginning uh outline of sort of
how the, the local community is
thinking about hardening their
community.
Do we have any initial sort of
thoughts on that from the DFA
and I know there's a great deal
of work that's being done with
LSC, uh, with Emner and, and the
executive and others on sort of
a
A lot on that watershed side in
the firefighting side but wanted
to give both of you.
Sort of that question about how
we help communities, not
recover, but sort of
Hard, harden their ass, yeah.
So Mr. Chair Representative
Small, um.
You know, there's, there's been
a lot of talk about the
disasters and, you know, we at
DFA have.
Many staff who have gone to both
to really.
For the the areas and see
firsthand with the disaster
looks like, and it definitely
puts some perspective for us
because we're not just pushing
paper, right? We're actually, we
know we're affecting lives and
we're trying to be very
effective in what we do. And
Secretary Puls has toured both
uh fires and and the devastation
that has been um
Brought by by the both the fires
and the flooding in both areas,
so we definitely take this very
seriously at DFA.
Now, there's a lot of things
that
We, we can see can be improved,
um, I think.
Getting the money out to the
entities was our first.
Um,
You know, real push. That's what
we wanted to do is make sure the
money got there, but now seeing
that they're having a hard time
spending it, then we have to
figure out how do we help them
with that piece of it and the
statewide price agreement, I
think will help in a little bit
with that. Now, there could be
more that has to be done before
cause that's reactive, right?
instead of being proactive. Mr.
Chair, director, and, and deputy
director and director. I've no,
I, I frankly, I want to
celebrate the amount of
Time in the uh reduction in time
in both the legislature acting
and you all doing work.
I think is, is by far the
quickest, I'm sure it's the
quickest in the state's history
on that sort of level of scale
outside of emergency orders. So
there is absolutely no, no
critique at all, um.
I think it's
This is more of a question as we
move forward with our other
stakeholders, local, you know,
driven, uh, and very much um
Collaborative locally, uh, uh,
efforts, but the
You know, what, what sticks with
me and I come from a community
where we're yet to break 4
inches for the whole year.
We're, we're at 3.98 right now
as of, which is, so I, I think
it's
Only to sort of share that the,
the challenges we've
historically faced as a state
with a lot of different climates
which make us.
Incredibly rich.
Um,
It it is
Increasingly evident in our
month to month lived lives that
the climate shifts that are
happening if we want to, and I
think it's.
However we wanted our
The thing that sticks with me is
that what we're seeing now is
much likely to be more intense
and more extreme as time goes
on. So we have to sort of.
Really come together not only on
the response side and just be
ready to respond more but to
look upstream both proverbially
and literally to to do as much
work as we can, and I heard
again with Mayor Crawford
talking about some of the um
Some of that upper watershed,
the vision there, uh, I think a
question, and this isn't a
question I need answered, but to
put out there, Mr. Chair, is um
You know,
For the most part, I think we
Oh yeah, well.
Um,
Whomever is on Zoom, if you can
mute while and then obviously I
know we'll get to those folks.
Um,
The
Awesome. Uh, excellent. The
You know, I know many of the
consultants who helped
communities respond and that was
an innovation, one of credit
Chair Munoz and others for the
sort of the uh funding to DHSEM
to do some more like local work
with communities on going
through the disaster process of
Vincent, I think, describes it
well, um, and you know, I know
anytime I have to fill out
paperwork for anything, you
know, in the midst of a disaster
sort of being given many new
hurdles, even if
There's funding on the other
end.
We're doing a little bit more of
that.
Does the, the state, we don't,
yeah, really have though sort of
a that concierge service, not
just in disaster response but in
sort of like a
Watershed response. Do we have
folks who go through and say,
here's how we need to redesign
our roads and culverts. Here's,
we have great confidence in
Director McCarthy and forestry
and that's, I think, evidenced
by the funding that's been put
their way.
To trust that this we have.
The outlines of a pretty strong.
Team to sort of say this is what
we need to do in our watersheds.
Do we have that at some of these
other infrastructure levels or
do we rely
Mostly on sort of the private
sector consultants for say water
treatment or road repair or
things like that.
Uh, Mr. Chair and representative
of Small, I, I don't have the
full answer for you, but what I
do know is there have been a lot
of committees formed since the
Hermit's Pe Half Canyon fire,
um, and, and a lot of state
agencies as well as federal
agencies are members of that
committee, uh, DHSCM is the the
main lead for that committee,
and FEMA is also involved, and
we're meeting at least monthly
and and a lot of has been shared
across the board as to not just
how to
How to better react, but how to
be proactive. And so I, I do
feel like there is um an effort
in that.
It going towards that path.
Um, now, I think it's, it's
still very new, and I think
we're still working towards
that, but definitely, um that is
in play right now and there has
been a lot of discussions
regarding how do we, how do we
do this better?
Awesome. Thank you, Deputy
director. Thank you, chair.
That's maybe, uh, maybe that's a
place where we can look to get
um you know, the report or sort
of the, the
Uh, lessons learned from that
group and particularly as you
point out the sort of the
proactive nature, um.
It sounds that, that sounds like
something we should look forward
to getting this year as we
continue to do the work that
we're leading. Thank you. Thank
you very much. Thank you both.
Thank you very much, Chairman
Small, and you bring up a very
good point when you say
celebrate.
There's so many people that are
out there that really deserve,
if you will, um, it's not
recognition, but the thanks for
the ongoing efforts that they've
put forward, including the
people there at DFA, so that's
uh it's a very good point and I
hope that we're able to go ahead
and continuously recognize the
people that are the the heroes
and all of these uh unfortunate
situations that we deal with.
OK, that uh basically concludes
this portion of the uh the
agenda for today. I want to
thank you very much for the
information. We look forward to
uh bringing more information
forward. We don't know how
that's gonna happen. Uh, we may
consider maybe a um another
subcommittee virtually, uh, but
in the meantime, the information
that we do need, uh, hopefully
would be given to our LFC staff
and vice versa if there's things
that we can help you with and
let's
Continue to go ahead and build
if you will, um, some strong
results and recommendations for
the upcoming legislative
session.
But we're getting ready for the
next presentation to those
people that are joining us
online, um, the presentations
will be available at our
legislative Finance Committee
website. So, uh, after today if
there is information that uh was
reviewed and you wish to go and
receive that information, please
go to the website.
Along with that, there may be
additional information coming
up.
Uh, or at least responses by
those that are participating
online that they may wanna share
with us or if you will, um, uh,
participate in that
recommendation process. So the
way we handle the first part of
the presentation today with the
agenda, uh, will be very similar
in terms of this next portion.
So we're now going to the
property insurance in New Mexico
status and reform options, and
so again to the presenters, if
you will introduce yourself and
begin the presentation.
Again, thank you very much for
being here with us.
Mr. Chair and committee members.
I'm Laura McCarthy. I'm the
state forester and forestry
division director at Energy
Minerals and Natural Resources
Department.
Um, we have prepared a two-part
presentation. I will be laying
out uh some framework for
consideration of the insurance
issues and then uh my
co-presenter will.
Finish up uh with a more
specific details about insurance
and I have slides that I will go
through, um, starting on page 2
with the challenge and uh you've
already really in the
conversation that you've had
over the last hour been
addressing what the challenge is
in terms of wildfire and
post-fire flooding.
And
Uh, you, of course, are aware
that insurers are canceling
policies and or not writing new
policies.
Uh, you've had a lot of
discussion already about the
need to thin overgrown forests
that are in poor health and poor
condition and the forestry
division and our many
cooperators and partners are
working as aggressively as we
have staff and money to um
accomplish that.
It's also important to recognize
that the tree thinning is only a
part of the solution and in
fact, um, insurers don't care
that much about it, what the
insurers are looking at is the
condition of the home and
whether the home is in a
condition to survive wildfire.
So if you look at my slide on
page 2, you will see a home that
had tree thinning done and had
the home hardening around the
actual building itself, and you
can see the patch of green grass
right out in front of the deck.
On the next page, page 3, home
hardening is the other 50%, and
that is the part that the state
of New Mexico doesn't have
programs in place currently to
help.
The existing homeowners who are
facing uh wildfire risk threat,
and are having challenges with
their insurance. The insurance
industry itself has created
programs that we can use as
models.
And we know from other states
that property owners who take
the steps that the insurance
industry recommends are
accessing insurance.
Now, it is also important, um,
affordable housing is at crisis
levels in New Mexico and there
is no doubt that the home
meeting of the full committee in
Riodoso and gave a presentation.
I tried to include information
that you hadn't already seen
about the wildfire prepared
homes program and what's most
important is that it's a program
that enables homeowners to take
preventative measures and know
exactly what it is that they
would need to do to bring their
home into compliance.
The um the, the second of the
wildfire prepared home slides
shows the designation
certificate levels that IBHS
uses. The first one is for
retrofitting homes primarily,
that's their base program, and
the second is the wildfire
prepared home plus program that
is for newer home construction.
This program is currently only
available in California and
Oregon, and um
My co-panelists, uh, Melissa
Robertson can speak to uh the
questions that she has asked of
IBHS. What would it take to
bring this program into New
Mexico, but I'll let her address
that.
Um, they do have 6 simple steps
to certification, that's my
second to last slide. It's
really very similar to Boulder
and California and Alabama, and
that is there's an assessment or
evaluation, the homeowner makes
changes, there's uh a
reassessment. There's to assure
that the changes are compliant
with the standards, then there's
The issuance of a certificate
and then insurance policy gets
written.
Same steps, uh, any every
program. And then finally, um
there is a a picture here of,
uh, it's a sketch, but it's of a
design contest for
wildfire-ready homes that was
conducted in another state and
um I think it's a really good
illustration of something that
we need to consider, which is
that our wildfire hardened homes
will look a little different,
but they're not gonna
The dirt donuts, they're um they
can look really nice and we're
gonna need to um get used to
seeing a diff a little different
aesthetic that is gonna allow
our homes to be built in places
that have wildfire risk.
At the same time that, of
course, we're addressing the
problem of overgrown forest
conditions.
And um we may need an education
campaign along with this, um,
Mr. Chair, with that, I am done.
Thank you very much. Please
proceed with the presentation.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and
committee. I am Melissa
Robertson. I am the property and
casualty bureau chief for the
Office of Superintendent of
Insurance.
Um,
I'll go and just jump into
slides. Um, my first slide,
we're talking about the New
Mexico fare plan.
So right now, New Mexico is in.
A situation where
I believe we're going to have to
start off with pilot programs.
To go ahead and bring this in,
and so we are looking at the
Boulder County.
Um,
Idea and so we are very lucky to
have a fair plan already in the
state that we can go ahead and
utilize and start as a pilot
program to allow accessibility
to insurance and also start
putting IBHS standards in place.
Our um fair plan has actually
been, it's been established
since 1969.
And so
The foundation is there. It's
just a matter of bolstering it.
As it sits right now, it is a
policy of last resort.
It does have limited coverage
and it is very minimal premium.
When I say minimal premium,
we're about the 4th cheapest in
the nation right now.
So there's lots of room to
bolster this and move forward.
Um, the next slide is.
What we are looking to do is
start a pilot program utilizing
Lincoln County and Riodoso. This
is needed and it's needed now.
Um, what we're hoping to do by
this is create a very healthy
living environment.
After a disaster, I know, uh,
you know.
Representative Vincent's always
said, the fundings thereafter,
but what can we do before? So
let's use this pilot program.
And
Go ahead and move out in the
state after this.
To allow people to have access
to insurance before the
catastrophes happen or to be
able to
You know, build in an area where
they're not sure or an insurance
company is not willing to be in
at that moment.
So the goal for this is, again,
to access coverage in high high
risk areas.
Um, we have done some background
and Fannie Mae does accept the
fair plan for lending.
So, you know, this gives the
ability to buy and finance homes
in an area where the need is
great right now.
Um, financial protection of your
largest asset.
We have found out by being on
the ground in Riodoso, there
were many homes not insured.
And you know, it's been a mix of
it wouldn't happen to me or I
couldn't afford it.
So the last thing, and I think
this is of utmost importance
right now, especially in Lincoln
County, is they need stability
and peace of mind.
It's been 5 months of insanity
down there. We've been on the
ground since the 4th day.
Um, with that being said, there
are changes necessary to our
fare plan.
To accommodate what is happening
right now.
Um, like I said, it's always
been a plan of last resort 2
years ago, the superintendent
did request that we raise the
coverage to 350,000 for a
residential structure.
That was based on the median
cost of a home in the state.
Riodosa we know does not fit
that mold.
And so what we are looking to do
is raise the residential limit
in Lincoln County to 100 for an
individual home.
And 2 million in businesses.
However, that is with a cap of
50.
Because we do have condos that
they can right now ensure the
first building for 1 million and
each additional building for an
additional 1 million.
And there is no cap on that, so
we do have to put a cap on that.
To allow solvency within the
program.
Um,
With this, we are, and this is
going into what um our forester
just said there's going to be
requirements though for staying
staying and joining our fair
program.
Um, with existing policyholders
in Lincoln County, which there
were several, and they still
have their homes.
We are going to allow one year
to retrofit and harden your
property.
To be able to stay in the
program.
Um, to the wildfire prepared
home standards.
Uh, policyholders coming in with
an already built structure.
Again, they're gonna have that
same one year.
To retrofit and harden to the
home standards.
Policyholders with new
construction Lincoln County.
The homes must be built to the
IBHS Wildfire Prepared Home
standards?
And we are looking to move that
actually to the plus standards.
They're in the process of
construction, the cost
differentiation is very little
for new. Um, with this insurance
quotes must be obtained in the
open insurance market every 3
years.
And what this does is it
Does not allow people to camp
out in the fair plan because
it's convenient.
And again, it's minimal
coverage, so it's fire,
malicious, malicious mischief.
Um,
And vandalism. So we want them
to go out into the open market
where they have additional
coverage. They have the
liability, they have the
replacement. Um, with this, we
are also looking at grants.
Very similar to what Boulder
County and California has done
for low to moderate income
households to assist with the
retrofitting and hardening. And
again, this is just a pilot
program.
The goal is to slowly move this
into the state, but we're going
where the need is at, right.
Um, next slide is the
certification of IBHS standards.
Again, mimicking older and
California and Oregon.
Um, we are looking at a
certification process.
Um, I have talked with the state
fire marshal's office.
Um, we are looking cal fire
actually has their uh fired.
Um, personnel that go in, they
certify with IBHS.
And then they can go out, they
can inspect the property.
Let them know what changes need
to be made, let the homeowner
have time to retrofit and
harden, go back out and then
issue a certification that the
insured then does send to their
company. Um, in talking to the
state fire marshal we.
Looked at what would
Right now handle the load and he
can do 3 personnel.
From each county again as we
move further into the state and
this program grows, we know
there'll be more person.
The insurance also have duties
in this, that they need to, you
know, complete, and this is some
of whatever I touched on.
You know, they will need to
reach out to the certified
personnel to go out and do the
inspection.
They have to maintain defensible
space that 0 to 5 ft is
critical.
So, but, you know, again, we
have to get pine needles off of
roofs. We have to get.
You know, green, uh,
Anything green essentially next
to the home we have watched a
couple live burn demonstrations
and they refer to them as green
gas cans.
We have seen very well
maintained and watered
vegetation.
Actually catch the house or the
deck on fire, so that 0 to 5 ft
is critical.
Um,
Consumers have to request that
their property be inspected
every 3 years, and this is
because we live in New Mexico
and things grow back.
So we need to assure that their
property is still being
mitigated and maintained.
And again, we are
Asking consumers to shop the
open market.
So they don't use utilize the
fair plan as a comfort policy.
Um,
And as Laura said, we have
talked to IBHS and industry
where there's a whole group of
us working together.
And to be able to bring the IBHS
home program into the state.
What we're needing right now is
funding for mitigation, one of
their requirements.
Um, the companies have to file
to use the IBHS standards that
goes through my bureau.
I have researched and wants
these
Steps are being put into place.
They are seeing companies file
in.
Um, 5 of the largest companies
are filing.
They filed within I think 6
months in California and 8
months within Colorado to
utilize this program.
And then we're needing a large
scale builder contractor to
actually be willing to build new
construction with the IBHS
standards.
At this point,
We are open for any questions or
comments.
Uh, thank you both very much for
the presentation. Before I go to
questions, I would just like to
ask representatives from the uh
From our our fire division if
they would come forward so that
we're able to ask a couple of
questions as well.
And uh I'm gonna be going to
questions now so representative
uh Lujan, please.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I really
appreciate the presentation.
This is really, you've, you put
a lot of work into this, um,
even for the last time we were
presented with some of this
information, so thank you for
doing that work. I think this
takes into account.
Um,
A balanced approach of, you
know, both the, the property
owners and what we're able to
do. Do you see any other, do you
see any gaps that we're with it
are not accounted in this uh
proposal or what you're you're
looking at doing.
Uh, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Chair, Representative Lujan.
Right now we have to start with
education. We need the education
area fulfilled first.
We are looking at a couple
different options on that, um.
First of all.
Laura has brought up working
with even the colleges because
New Mexico is concerned that
their property is going to be a
dirt. It doesn't have to look
like that. New Mexico has
beautiful landscape that we can
add from that 0 to 5 ft, that 0
zone.
And so that's education is
number one.
Secondly, we are going to need
the additional funding to
bolster the fair plan.
Right now, it is so any
assessments right now go to the
insurance companies.
So we're needing to provide a
backstop for them.
To number one, let the insurance
companies or industry be a
little more comfortable that if
we take these coverages up to
$1000 and we have another
catastrophic loss.
The industry is not going to be
assessed.
You know, multi-millions, which
has happened in other states. So
we're needing to provide a
backstop. We are going to, um,
right now I believe our and
that's 2 underwriters a claims
adjuster, a director.
And
But we are definitely going to
have, um, you know, they do have
to do to be able to issue this.
But we believe this is the
fastest way you need it most.
Thank you. And what are those,
uh, what, what numbers are you
looking at to grow, um, from the
5 FTs to have a fully function.
I mean this is a lot of work,
and you're even going to ask the
fire marshal.
Uh,
You say we'll certify 3
personnel from each county to
complete the IBHS certification
inspection. I mean, this is a
lot, a lot of work, considering
how big our state is, and we all
know that. Can you let us know
what those numbers are looking
like for you. Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
Yes, right now we are looking at
50 million.
To start bolstering the fair
plan.
This will allow us to put it at
least a $20,000 backstop.
Because again, if we have a fire
come through and we're up at 10.
That's not gonna go very far.
Um, we have talked to the
director. She is looking at
roughly 350,000 bolster her
crew.
As well as put in the IT changes
that.
And then we would be looking at
the additional for to help with
the mitigation.
Or the low.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, I really
appreciate those, those answers
and, and those, those numbers it
this is just gonna get bigger,
um, and bigger, Mr. Chair, uh.
And I brought this up in the
introductory.
How are you looking at, I guess
through this through the scope
or the lens of insurance and
much to what.
Um, the superintendent had
talked about, she's been going
to many conventions and
understanding, you know, the
climate change issue in
association with um insurance
response.
What
Or what is her, and she's not
here today, which I wish she was
because I know she's been
focused on this, um.
What, what are you, what are we
looking at or expecting in the
future, um, as far as, as having
to respond to these natural
disasters.
Mr. Chair.
And
I'm sure superintendent Kane
does. We are.
By bringing in the IBHS
standards, first of all for
fire.
We are seeing in the other
states that the industry has
came back into the area and came
back.
Which will keep our market very
um.
I know it was brought up earlier
about the wind and hail in
Chavis County.
Um,
IBHS does also.
Look at the scientific
background of that. And so they
are looking at certain
sightings. They're looking at
garage doors, they're looking at
roofing. So as this pilot
program goes right now.
The focus is fire, but we do
know that the wind and hail.
will be
You know, right on its tail,
especially with what is
happening.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I think
that um
The big, the point that you
mentioned on education, and you
mentioned that there would be,
we'd be looking at colleges, um.
How, how are you?
Uh, how else are you looking to
educate in, and we're going to
have to change maybe some codes.
And it's a lot of, it's a, it's
a big lip, so if you can just uh
stop there after that, but.
Tell me how you're planning
that, Mr. Chair and
representative, um, I.
opted not to present uh data
again uh that was presented in
August.
Uh, Utah has a public education
campaign that's been very
effective, uh, we've looked at
that.
And Emner has a special
appropriation request for $2000
to launch that kind of program,
potentially using um the same
materials that Utah develop.
Um, that would be a tremendous
cost savings to the state that's
been offered to us by Utah, uh,
Forestry division there.
Perfect. Thank you. That's all I
have right now, I'm sure. Thank
you for the, for answering my
questions. Thank you very much,
Representative Lou Horning, you
bring up a very valid point and
I'm gonna ask the state fire
marshal to help us to respond,
and part of that was uh in each
county if there'll be 3
individuals that would be made
available to help to deal with
this, uh, what is that support
gonna look like and then what
are your needs going to be
because that uh as I already
been mentioned, uh, as a large
state land wise and with many.
Our communities, uh, can 3
individuals in each one of our
counties amply address this type
of issue. Please proceed.
Oh, Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, uh, so we've been
discussing this, so you can go
out with our training academy or
ferry academy, they can go out
and actually train 3 personnel
from each county or municipality
to go out and train the
communities.
I as to what to do with this. We
can also train the if you have a
planning and zoning and they
have members that we can train
in those divisions. We can also
do that. But I think if we run
into our training academy, we
can actually reach out most of
the state.
And we do have the person at the
academy. We would need a couple
additional personnel, and I
think the cost of that was about
220,000 just for uh benefits and
salary, not to include equipment
and uh and drugs to go out to to
the areas, but one of the things
is is as we move forward with
this we can actually educate
more of the volunteers out there
and more at the fire departments
to go out and actually do this
training and assessments for the
communities if.
The communities are willing to
do that. Thank you very much for
your response. Any further
questions? I think it's a
representative Vincent.
Representative Vincent, please.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Man, this has been the best
presentation I've been out in a
while. I'm just gonna tell you
that.
And you know how my wheels are
turning on the 3 personnel. I
was just talking about
incentives and I'm thinking,
man, they're on to something.
And that could be really good,
but um my biggest deal is I just
want to thank you.
Or thinking about Lincoln
County.
Thank you for the pilot program.
Um,
I, I try to get myself on the
record as much as I can because
I'm not trying to get uh I'm not
trying to get the, the state
into the insurance business.
I really am not, you know, I,
I've got lots of friends, um,
that are in the insurance
business and that's what they do
for a living, but
Whenever I get the phone calls
and the emails of people that
want to come back home. They
have literally been evacuated
from Lincoln County.
Since this started, cause they
have nothing to come back to and
they're gone.
And you know, they're, they're
all the way over towards
Lubbock, Texas, and they're
like, I want to come home, but
um I can't get written on a
policy.
And it starts a domino effect,
Mr. Chairman, so you can't, if
you're a realtor, you're not
selling no property because you
can't get written on the, on
insurance and and everybody it
it does everybody a disservice,
and my biggest deal was.
You know, I'm not gonna name uh
an insurance agency, but if an
agency that I go to does not
give me the option to get a
policy.
I believe that that the state
owes it to New Mexicans.
To be able to make them hold to
where they can go and find a
house, get a loan. Now, this
fair plan you, you, you
mentioned that uh Fannie Mae
recognizes this, is that any
financial institution, any bank.
That deals with Fannie Mae?
Mr. Chairman,
As long as it is a Fannie
Freddie Mac because this has
come up.
Nationally, because they are
not.
Um,
They do not offer replacement
cost.
But right now with the
catastrophes across the.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. That's
music to my ears because it, you
know, a lot of the institutions
weren't looking at the fair plan
as a legit source of getting
funding. So now that we're able
to get funding, we're one step,
we're one step ahead. One thing
I would like to see and I
really, I'm really glad that you
guys bumped that to 350,000 and
that is a basic house in Ridoso.
Unfortunately, and I don't even
know why.
Uh, but it's a basic house in
Ridoso and um
I don't even know if 350, 350 is
way better than 225, but at 3:50
at least people have an option.
Now, on the commercial side,
Um,
The cap is gonna be.
200 I mean 2 to 5 million, is
that correct? How do you know if
it's 2 or 5 million, Mr.
Chairman.
The represented Vincent.
So initially it was only 100 and
then they could do subsequent
buildings in their commercial.
Package is still in all reality,
they could go up to 10 million,
which solvency the to handle
that. So we are allowing one
commercial policy with $2
million and up to a total of 50.
So if it's just um.
I'm thinking about one of the
buildings in Mid. It would be 20
if it was a condo association
they could and the subsequent.
Uh, either by 10 or 2 million.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and you
know, one thing that I was
thinking about in this whole
scheme of things is, it seems
like wildfire is the big bad
wolf. That's the one everybody's
afraid of.
And
I was just brainstorming, and
this is just a brainstorm.
Um,
Say, say, you know, uh, an
insurance agency just didn't
want to cover you in wildfire.
Maybe we ought to put that
burden on the state and the
state has a vested interest to
make sure that our, our areas
are thinned.
So that they're not on the hook
for stuff and that might give
the state some incentive to
throw some more money out there
to make sure that we have our
thinning projects in line, just,
just some food for thought, Mr.
Chairman, and then
To the state fire marshal's
office. I knew you guys had
pulled that out of your hat and
start educating people on this
particular thing. That's
probably one of the best ideas
I've heard in a while and um now
you're talking about 3 personnel
from each county or how does
that work? Uh, Mr. Chapent
Vincent, yes, uh, our plan is to
go out and start off uh with the
academy going out and training 3
personnel from each county, so
they can go out and do this. As
we move forward and we get more
people.
Interested in it, we can train
more individuals to go out. Uh,
our plan is to go out and hit
the volunteer department and
then see if there's any
incentives for them so they can
go out and get reimbursed while
they do this.
And kind of bring up our
volunteer system at the same
time.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That's
music to my ears because I'm,
I'm currently working with the
New Mexico cattle growers, and
they were asking me, what's some
incentives that we can give our
volunteers?
Well, we just found it. Well,
you found an incentive that I
think is outstanding and
Not every county is going to be
the same, you know, uh, a lot of
our mountainous communities
might need 6.
They might need 10 and then some
of our other communities that
don't have a whole lot growing
in them, might only need 1 or 2.
So hopefully we can, we can
figure out how, how that's gonna
look. And then my last, well,
two things.
When we talk about hardening our
houses, what is, what is our
contractors gonna say.
When we started asking about
that, what is materials gonna,
is that gonna bring up the, you
know, the, right now, a square
foot building per square foot is
It's crazy.
I think it's up to like 300 $350
in Rioso.
Um,
Is that going to add to these
commercial or these uh
residential costs, and is it
gonna weed people out of being
able to build houses, Mr.
Chairman.
Mr. Chair and Representative
Vincent, um, we haven't looked
into it in great detail. Um,
however, if supportive of the
idea of this pilot.
A constructive follow up action
would be uh with the and uh
personnel from Lincoln County to
uh do some estimating as to how
many households are we talking
about that uh potentially could
need home hardening that would
qualify as low or moderate
income, that would be data the
county might have as well as um
uh conversations with some
contractors about the kind of
work and the
Um, sort of almost like not a
statewide price agreement, but
the kinds of questions that you
would ask in putting a price
agreement together about general
costs, and with that we could
then estimate what a mitigation
fund for a pilot project
specific to Lincoln County.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd
love to see some kind of an
incentive program put together
that if you did harden your
house, you get.
You get a discount or, or maybe
the state could help you out,
uh, on some tax credits or or
something like that. And then
the last thing is on the um
On the hardening of houses.
I don't know, I was just
thinking about a CTE program
maybe for our local college
where they could go in there and
and learn this this industry
right here and be able to go in
and retrofit and maybe not have
to have a GB 98. Maybe they just
have to have, you know, a basic
license where they could go in
and maybe harden the outside
houses. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Very good points, Representing
Vincent. Appreciate that. Going
to Senator Gonzalez. Senator
Gonzalez, please. Thank you, uh,
Mr. Chairman and thank you to
our presenters and uh.
And uh Laura, I saw you on
television on Channel 5, and you
did an excellent job.
I Focus, New Mexico, huh.
Um,
What I wanted to ask you is um
I think as we're having now.
This full discussions, we have
to look at the full picture and
uh and by this, um, what I'm
gonna bring up is um
Uh, New Mexico is very rich in
history.
And like what we have seen in
some of these fires.
Some of these families have been
in some of these areas for
over 100 years or even more.
That's
One time
And then we have individuals
that choose to leave.
In the mountains by choice.
And I'm one of those. I live in
the mountains.
And
What I'm, uh, you know, this was
brought up by one of the fires
that was way back on Ridoso.
And this was done by the late uh
state representative Doug
Williams.
And the thing about it is um uh
I really think we need to
address compliance?
Because um we can have our
neighbor here to the right.
That will follow
But your person and do beyond.
And then you can have the person
next to him with a completely
potential possibility of a
disaster.
And uh uh during that time that
was brought up in a
representative um
Lea Williams presented, we have
a law.
And the law can be enacted by
the county.
So, you know, if someone sees
that it can be a potential.
To harm
You know, within a community,
the county has the
As the right to impose that they
can go and clean, and if they do
not wish to pay, then it becomes
a lien on the property.
And that's very, you know, you
don't want to go that way unless
you really have to, but we do
have some situations, you know,
with individuals that will have
345 cars parked and and some
other materials and they haven't
been moved for 15 years.
And you know, it just um.
Yet at the same time they're in
this areas, so anything can
happen.
And uh
Uh, meeting with one of the
forest rangers, so just um.
last couple of weeks.
You know, he was telling me one
of the observations that he does
the most, he says is he says
empty gas containers.
Outside or not protected.
And he says, one that is full
and one that, you know, with
the, with the right heat and
with the right and uh this kind
of, um, you know, uh, of course,
you know, bringing in the
education component really,
really will be a boost, but at
the same time, if you do have
individuals that will not comply
no matter what.
And you know, to what authority
can we work with this?
Individual or family is
presenting a threat to an
entire.
Community or to potential
millions of dollars of damage
because of.
Non-compliance. So that's one
area that I, I would really like
to see work on and I would be
more than glad to, to really
assist with um.
Whatever direction we want to go
with that.
But there is a law in place.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank
you very much, Senator Gonzalez,
and I know that uh as we move
forward, uh, some of the members
may have to leave, but as uh we
consider so much of this
information they are sharing
very valuable information and I
appreciate the presentations as
well as we go, uh go ahead with
this uh particular agenda.
Moving along then to Senator
Woods. Senator Woods, please.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
OK, I need to get the mechanics
down on this just a little bit
better.
Um,
on a fair plan today.
200 and
$25,000 fare plan.
Every insurance company out
there this pro that presently
issues insurance.
Well
Sell a fair plan.
It is licensed in property in
Canada. And and
A fair plan
Covers
Fire and flood.
Does it cover, it is, is the
perils, does it cover all the
perils? What perils does it
cover? It is a named peril
policy and it's fire.
Um, malicious mischief,
vandalism.
There's only 5 perils, sir.
barrels.
has open perils.
OK.
And, and is that one of the
reasons?
That most mortgage companies.
Won't use the fair plan.
As their base of a mortgage.
Mr. Chair, Senator Woods, it is
because it does not offer
replacement cost.
It doesn't offer replacement
costs.
So that was going to be my next
question. So how do you
determine
How the policy, uh, that you,
you sell.
The the producer sells.
It it is done by appraisal.
There is several different
factors, so there is, they use a
company where they input the
information from the house. It
takes and it looks at cost of
and then there is also a
physical inspection of the home
to assure that the information.
So essentially it's a cost.
I depreciated cost.
Right.
It's not a replacement cost,
it's a depreciated cost. That is
correct.
OK.
So I depreciated costs may or
may not cover.
The cost of the mortgage and
that's why
Another, so there's two reasons.
That, uh, uh, uh.
Bank doesn't want to use this.
Particular plan.
OK.
Now you say Fannie Mae will.
Do this.
What are the restrictions to get
a Fannie Mae loan.
Compared
The commercial any other.
alone. Is it very restrictive?
To get that particular loan.
And I don't need to know the
specifics, a yes or no answer.
Fannie Mae is actually one of
the easier loans to be able to
obtain. OK. So we're not
restricting buyers that way.
OK.
So
The cost
Of the fair plan.
is considerably less.
In a multi parallel insurance
plan because it's not covering
as many perils.
That is correct on the.
Proposed changes we would move
closer to a market rate but
still an actual cash value.
But again, as as senator
Gonzalez is telling us.
Compliance to buy insurance.
It's still not a requirement of
owning a home.
So
You, your neighbor may or may
not have.
Insurance on his home.
There's, there's not much you
can do about that.
But you're trying to protect
your own home.
And what we're trying to do.
I
I get people.
To
With this fair plan, they are
now.
Going to do the, the home
hardening along with that, and
that will help reduce some of
the perils.
That we're talking about
earlier.
That is correct, and by
The number of policyholders that
we see moving towards the fair
plan, it will also start to grow
the community mitigation.
Which will bring in the
industry, you know, that much
quicker. And so that what we're
hoping the commercials will come
back in.
As we harden these homes.
Absolutely.
Uh, Mr. Chair, Senator Woods,
one thing to add is that um IVHS
is currently developing another
component of their program to
address neighborhood compliance.
So exactly the line of
questioning that you've been um
putting in front of us. We have
not seen what the new elements
of the neighborhood compliance
program.
That they offer will look like.
Um, when we last spoke with them
about it in August, they were
thinking of a fall release, and
that is something that we can
follow up on because if there is
Um,
You know, uh, Senator Gonzalez
talked about the stick, but IBHS
really comes at it from the
carrot perspective, and it would
be good um for us to be up to
speed on what they're what
they've concluded so that we
might be able to include
anything, uh, any of their good
ideas in any.
And just to quickly
How did you come up a reserve of
50?
Mr. Chair, Senator Woods, it
Right now we'd be looking at a
backstop for the fair plan of
$20 million and that is based on
the current numbers in uh
Riodoso and Lincoln County that
the fare plan does currently
have active.
And what we're seeing in the
sense of what will need to be
rebuilt?
Versus what is
20 million is what?
is current in Riodosa.
For the fair plan.
You need a $200 million reserve.
Currently
For the ones that own
A fair plan.
The houses that are covered by
the fair plan.
Mm. No, sir. Right now, the fare
plan does have enough reserves
for the current policies. This
would help take the load off of
the new policies that people are
seeing cancellations and
non-renewals, and also
rebuilding and not able to
obtain insurance. It would be
for the additional policies
coming. Of what amount?
I'm sorry?
What amount you say.
Are we talking 20 million, 50
million.
What, what amount are you
talking about for reserves? 4
reserves, we need 200 million.
reserves will need 20 million
and then we're going to put this
plan into operation under a
market.
Driven force so that we're not.
Way below market, way above
market, we're gonna try to put
it within the market.
And, and then.
Will the general insurance
company still be required?
To pay into the reserve.
Absolutely. So right now the
fair plan is funded. They are
allowed to do assessments as
needed, but they are funded by
insured premium.
So right now the reserves that
they have.
Um, up until this year have all
been carried through insured
premium. This year they did have
to do an assessment.
Because we had the wind and hail
event on the eastern side of the
state.
Followed by 2.5 weeks later.
The fires in Riodoso.
So we would have to come in with
a
Uh
$20 million reserve.
And then with that combined with
the current the correct market
rates.
That should hold them solvent,
however.
If there is a loss, we are not
letting the insurance companies
off the hook. There will still
be allowed assessments.
Well, I don't know enough about
the insurance business to, to
know.
I know that that
The policies that they have
outstanding.
They have to maintain a certain
amount of reserve.
For the policies outstanding.
And that's what you're saying
that eventually you think this
will involve into
Where it's self-sufficient.
That fun. If,
if the commercial
Policy
Sellers, the, the commercial
insurance companies don't get in
the market, then this will
evolve into a.
essentially a state-run
insurance policy.
We are not wanting it to run
into a state.
Fed insurance policy by any
means.
Our goal is to keep this as a
last resort policy.
And looking at.
Uh, California, Oregon.
Uh, strength in Alabama, that's
their program and Colorado, the
Uh, industry has come back.
That's why we are looking at a 3
to 5 year window.
We, we don't want it to be.
You know, the pro
Well, thank you very much.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you very much, Senator
Woods. Uh, any other discussion?
I don't see any. I just want to
thank you all very much for
presenting the information and
uh we'll continue to look at
this other options and
recommendations, and again, as
we share resources, um, let's
see what we can do as we go
along because it may not just be
introduction of legislation for
additional FDEs or other
information, it could also be
what resources we already have
available, uh, we can at least,
uh, uh, show
If you will, a pilot program and
go from there. And uh so the
discussion will continue, I'm
sure by the outreach with
members of the LFC staff, and at
the same time if you have
information to share with us
that you do that as well.
Thank you all very much.
So going to the last part of
this uh subcommittee meeting
today discussion of policy and
budget options. What I did at
the beginning of the meeting was
ask each member of some of their
thoughts and recommendations,
staff has uh taken note of those
recommendations, and at this
point just to kind of uh go
through that, uh, we're looking
at, if you will, the
recommendations of today. We've
received that. Please keep an
open heart, open mind as you go
forward if they're
Are the recommendations, submit
those to the Legislative Finance
Committee staff members, uh, so
they can incorporate those into
some of the suggestions as we
move forward.
Along with that, a couple of
other things, um, the, um,
Possibility of a uh a virtual
meeting because right now we're
coming into the crunch of the
LFC meetings, so, uh, uh, coming
in together if you will, as a
another subcommittee in person,
uh, may be difficult to do, so
we may schedule a virtual
meeting to go over some of the
recommendations with you and to
seek additional input, and then
lastly, uh, hopefully by
December, uh, either through
legislation, staff
recommendations.
Uh, come forth, if you will,
with some of the other thoughts
and ideas that uh people have
been putting forward in terms of
helping to rectify uh and to
address so many of these
disasters that New Mexico has
been faced with. So at this
point, uh, the, uh,
Opportunity is open to you to
offer additional discussion and
recommendations.
Any thoughts or ideas?
Any more thoughts or ideas? I
knew that was gonna happen,
Representative Vincent.
When to representing Vinson,
please. Thank you, Mr. Chairman,
and you know, I just want to let
you know how much I appreciate
being on this particular uh
subcommittee and
You know, none of us like to ask
for money. I really don't like
to ask for money, but any
recommendations that anyone has
to help.
With Lincoln County.
I just see the funds running out
and we're not even, we're not
even finished.
And, you know, I wanna see
everything put back the way it
should be and
You know, just an observation,
you know, we probably have a 100
trucks.
Run
Debris up there in our roads
were not in that great a shape
anyway. Now Sudrith, we just got
it replaced.
It's probably not gonna be that
pretty here in the next, in the
next year.
And
I see, I know how much it costs
to build roads.
And bridges and culverts and all
that stuff and.
If anyone has a way for me to
access.
Additional funds through grants.
Through appropriations, through
whatever.
I would sure like to be able to
talk offline with you or?
Here now
Or run bills with you, whatever
you wanna do. I just, I need to
bring some assistance back to my
county.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you very much,
Representative. A couple of
points on what you're talking
about. Number one as we go
forward, there's been a lot of
investment and work already put
into so much of this, and I know
you all have that institutional
knowledge, so we'll move forward
with that, along with that
outreach, uh, again, I
emphasize, as you just did.
It's important to bring forward
those thoughts and ideas, and I
see legislation coming forth as
Representative Chatfield has
talked about, uh, more of the
accountability as we see more of
how all this is going to come
together, especially with the uh
the, the growth of, of the need
that we have here in New Mexico
that has already been um uh
indicated as well. So there's
just so many thoughts and ideas
today that have been brought
forth very valuable thoughts and
ideas and.
We appreciate that. When I go to
the director uh Cli uh for uh
some final thoughts and ideas in
terms of how uh the um
LFC will be able to handle that
and then I'm gonna go ahead and
go on to uh representative uh
Sinyana.
So
Couple of my notes. One is
The need for continued work with
state forestry and others.
To figure out
I know
Future risk bases, where is our
greatest.
Risk areas.
Um, and
I don't know that we would get
to where we'd want to be by
doing one-offs with all of these
ideas in an individual
neighborhood amongst
individuals.
Uh, it sounds like from all the
information you've received at
two hearings now on this that it
really needs to be almost a a
neighborhood wide.
Effort
With multiple levels and
strategies.
Um,
And
In my mind, the cost keeps going
up and then you start uh
weighing, you know, the benefits
of, you know, $40,000 per house
gardening kind of project.
You can throw a lot of money and
not really.
Touch many houses real quick.
Even if, even if you have it.
So that's gonna be that just
requires the prioritization.
And then
You know, some key
considerations when you do start
prioritizing, which can be
challenging in and of itself.
Uh, are there, there again, the
geographic areas.
Um,
Neighborhood wide or community
wide buy in.
So that you don't have one patch
that maybe survives, but then
everything around it that didn't
want to go along with it, it
doesn't.
Um, even with the certification
program.
You know, having one street on
You know, a certain area that
gets certified, is that really
gonna solve the um insurance
issue that we face, you know,
what scale do we need to put
some of these things into place
to stabilize the insurance
market either in local
communities or even statewide. I
mean, Santa Fe is having
challenges with people all over
town being dropped.
Uh, that are in town.
Um,
And then we also probably need
to have a conversation amongst
ourselves of how do we deal with
Uh, primary houses versus
secondary houses.
I mean, in any grant programs.
Um, how do you deal with
Houses for hardening that.
Um, need a lot of work.
You know, is it, is it worse?
That
Investment
Be honest.
Uh, do you prioritize?
Anybody, like in the foothills
of Santa Fe or deep within the
canyons of San Miguel County,
two very different communities
and how you deal with that going
on a go forward basis.
And then thinking about uh the
new building standards and
rebuilding standards, I think
are are really key kinds of
things.
I know so that's kind of on a go
forward basis that I'm hearing
lots of different ideas uh from
these past two hearings.
Um,
On a
Dealing with the reality on the
ground in two communities in our
state that are reeling from a
devastating wildfires and the
ensuing.
Uh, flooding
Something that we can learn for
other communities is.
You know, making sure that we've
got a good strike team.
To be able to go in to assist
those communities to access as
well as think strategically over
the long term. We're not going
to be able to complete all the
need, but we've got a lot of
money tied up in things that
aren't gonna happen anytime
soon.
So how do we
reshuffle those and and put.
The priority on getting things
solved now and then planning for
the longer term going forward
because as I was telling.
The more money we've got tied up
in those types of projects is
the less money coming back to
the appropriation contingency
fund that we can use for other.
Either disaster or prevention.
So getting that $170 million
reimbursed back to the general
fund as soon as we can.
Uh, is really necessary and if
that takes a little bit of lead
money.
To help communities figure out
how to navigate.
And speed up the process with
FEMA that, that would maybe be a
good use of that.
Um, there's also
Uh, I heard today, you know, we
have the appropriation
contingency fund.
Which is our disaster fund.
Its cap is at 750,000 per
disaster, which is set at 1960s
level. And that was some serious
money in the 1960s. It's not.
Serious now.
But what's the right balance?
Of the executive being able to
spend money without kind of a
direct appropriation from the or
the legislature weighing in on
if that's the right right
amount.
So, you know, there could be
some threshold.
Uh, options that we bring back
to you.
That, you know, up to a certain
amount could be authorized up to
another amount needs to go to
maybe the board of Finance or
notification, you know, we'll
we'll.
Brainstorm around those.
Um,
But there's a, there's an amount
set aside every year in the
programs and we usually look at
like a 5 year average going
back.
Make a recommendation.
But then what happens when
you've got like a cat hard to.
Hard to figure out on a go
forward basis. So, uh, that's
why we're working with Pew.
Uh, and other
Um, organizations to help. So a
couple of different things go
forward, how do we help reduce
risk and ensure people can get
insurance.
How do we help those communities
that are challenged now with
near term kinds of uh funding
needs, uh, and then start having
a, an eyes wide open for longer
term funding needs.
3 to 5 years.
Um, and then how do we reform
potentially the way that we um
emergencies. I'm still, we're
gonna follow up to get you all
more information about.
How the emergency money is
actually being spent because you
see some of the removal and
Cleaning up the roads.
You know, you, you'd think that
that would have been part of it,
but maybe not. So if it's all
paying for firefighters, then
you need to know that kind of
what the parameters are. So
that's kind of
Some of what I
Summed up from the last two
hearings and today, uh, and work
for staff to be able to help
bring back um options for the
subcommittee.
Um, to be able to make
potentially a a full.
Recommendation to the full
committee is what I'm hearing,
Mr. Chairman.
Uh, thank you very much,
Director Sale. I really
appreciate the, the wisdom, the
uh conciseness in terms of what
your thought process is and as
we go forward, we all know it's
about education, training,
resources, and ultimately the
outcomes.12 represented a
certain place.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um, I
was looking at the LFC brief in
page 2 it says wildfire risk is
based on likelihood intensity
exposure and susceptibility.
New Mexico has a higher risk of
wildfires, higher than 80%, 80%
of states in the United States,
but doesn't really say why.
And I think we have to look at
the big picture, um.
What we're talking about today
continues to be a problem in our
state as long as climate
continues to get hotter. It's
gonna continue, right? We
continue to use a band-aid when
we need stitches. We need to
look at the big picture.
Um, ongoing extraction burning
of oil and gas significantly
contributes to climate change.
Um, which in turn increases the
likelihood of extreme weather
events and disasters, more
fires, more extreme floods. All
these things are going to
continue to happen until we do
something about climate change
until we do something about the
extraction of gas and oil that's
causing this. We kind of just
used to take the money and
The hell with everything else,
but insurance costs not only
here but our teachers are paying
higher insurance because our
rural teachers are because of
the San Juan and Permian Basin.
These things we have to look at
too, so it's not just, it's, we
can continue to have fires and
floods and and pay a lot of
money, but we have to look at
the root cause, and we know
that's the extraction process.
So we really need to start
talking about how we're gonna
really transition to renewable
energy or other things. We have
to get away from this, and I
know money is everything in this
committee, but
We're gonna, this is gonna
continue and continue and
continue and keep throwing money
at it, but
To what end?
Thank you very much for that and
uh the discourse is definitely
important as we go forward, it's
to keep an open mind and to
consider all these factors uh
that you're bringing forth and
that have been brought forward
throughout this afternoon and uh
some of our past meetings, and
that's the key in order for us
to truly come up with uh
reviewing the analytics and then
coming up with uh some of the
prioritization of what will
work. That's what definitely
gets us to a point to where we
are making some headway so I
appreciate that.
Going to uh Representative
Chatfield, Representative
Chatfield, please.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Uh, you know, treatment of
these, of our forests is
expensive.
Not treating them is even more
expensive.
So, I just wanna throw an idea
out there.
I've I've been.
My neck of the woods we have.
Uh, some small diameter timor
plants.
Um,
Vas Caldera.
100 years ago was clear cut.
It was perfectly fine for 100
years it became a flagship of a,
of our state, one of the
prettiest.
Most pristine areas in our
state. Most people don't know
that it was they cut a 100 years
ago.
Uh, that's not what we want to
do today.
But we need
Why
I've just thrown out the idea,
maybe we should have the thought
of some small diameter timber
plants.
They create Vegas, they create
fencing, they create firewood,
they create many, many things.
That offset the cost of that
spinning.
Uh, is there things that we
could be, that could be put in
place by the state that
encouraged some of these types
of private businesses, they
would go in there and do the
work for us instead of paying
the whole cost of getting, we
pay 25th of the cost or half the
cost or some ways to incentivize
thinning of our forests to a
healthy state.
Uh,
Risk of wildfire.
is caused by density.
At a certain density, it's not
likely to burn at a certain
density, it might burn.
And in a certain density, it
will burn and you can't put it
out.
Uh, you can talk to anybody that
That uh
It is in that field that that is
their business.
Wildfire risk is a factor of
density.
Uh,
So, if we want to reduce that
density, maybe we should.
Instead of paying for 100% of
it, maybe we should incentivize.
Um,
Companies that could pay for
some of it for us. Thank you,
Mr. Chair.
Uh, thank you very much,
Representative Chatfield, before
I go to uh Chairman Small. I'm
gonna defer quickly to a
director Sly.
But
I think
That's something that we'll
follow up with for with
forestry. You've dramatically
increased the thinning budget.
Uh, the federal government's
dramatically increased the
budget that they give them.
As well, to the point that uh
the last time I talked to um.
Director McCarthy about it. We
had gotten them to the point of
where they were at capacity with
their contractors.
That said, you're saying there's
Business opportunity beyond
that.
The challenge is
Where this is a significant
problem is not controlled by
The state being able to go in
and make those decisions if it's
US forest land. I mean,
somebody's got to take
leadership with being able to go
and to say, this is a high risk
area.
For us as a state, we've got
these opportunities to be able
to.
Make the forest more healthy.
Uh, for sure, but that is, uh, a
challenge that we need to.
Lean into. Thank you, Chairman
Small, please.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
Um, really appreciate the
continued, uh, being part of
these efforts. I think a few
things that stand out to me.
First, Mr. Chair, as it relates
to watershed health, which it
seems like is the best way.
At least that I've learned to
talk about some of these things,
um.
There are sort of no wrong
answers, and I think great
wisdom that's been shared.
There is a great deal of nuance,
and I want to offer a few pieces
that as I understand it, which,
you know, um.
It sort of goes into the hopper,
one.
Where and how we treat forest.
is very situationally dependent.
If it's on um depending on which
slope, you know, if it's south
facing.
Stripping all of that timber
away.
We'll do probably uh more harm
than good.
Because that's gonna retain less
of any of the snow that comes
there, any of the water is gonna
run off.
Maybe on north facing slopes,
you're able to thin.
In a more aggressive manner.
Um, I think we have a very
strong forestry director.
There's, there has been a lot
learned. I'm sure there'll be a
lot more to be learned.
I think applying that with as
much sort of nuance and detail.
And being ready to fund all of
the work and Mr. Chair, again,
you helped lead us on a tour of
the work last year. There is
work to be done everywhere,
whether that's um
One rock dams and, you know,
down logs that are helping far,
far up slope hold sediment back.
It's not that the work.
There is work to be done
everywhere, but we've got to do
the right work in the right
places, maybe as if I if it sort
of something that's become clear
to me.
Um,
To, uh, Mr. Chair, I think the
I'm interested to learn more
about.
When and how and under what
conditions the fires burn. We're
thinking and talking a lot about
density is fair.
There's
From what I've learned and read
a great deal also has to do with
sort of the ambient humidity.
Obviously, wind speed, we know
that.
But some of the things that
really
Um, or eye catching or the where
it's essentially much drier and
at times much warmer than
usually.
And our past regimes prior to,
you know, to not in in the
recent past.
Fire burned all the time, you
know, there's places that I
could to go outcoming if I'm
very lucky and draw a tag in the
very rare occasion. Uh, but at
least turkey hunting for sure,
cause you don't have to.
In in the healer where that's,
you know, it's burned for tens
of thousands of years.
And it's been a very continual
process and Mr. Chair, I also
note that, you know, the fire,
the, the, the grass, the
grassland fires that we've seen
some of those in Texas.
When it's hotter and drier.
Fire is a bigger problem,
wherever it happens, and that
seems like something that
Uh, because of
what we want to note it as
climate shift or climate change.
It's likely to intensify and so
again that just shows us that
we're, we're doing the right
work now.
Um,
But that, that's doing the right
work in the right places, uh,
Mr. Chair. Very much stands out
and, and I wanna acknow I think
the
You know, burning of fossil
fuels at a global level.
Is the primary contributor of
greenhouse gasses. That is a
true is absolutely true, at the
end of the day.
Um,
There is a great deal because
It is a global
Um,
Yeah
There are, you know, global
economy obviously on the daily
part. And so I think continuing
to understand our best role in
that.
From our multiple
responsibilities, not least of
which is financial and working
with.
Uh, our energy producers and
others.
Um,
Which I think work we're doing
uh we're doing more and more of
in our uh permanent funds.
And uh work in watershed
restoration and other areas, as
well as developing our claims,
which we're obviously doing a
great deal of in the state.
But um,
That it
Brings home to me, I'll
conclude, Mr. Chair, and sort of
Uh
That grappling with these
issues.
Really is some of the most
important work we'll do here for
the state and really appreciate
your leadership, the directors
work on it.
And uh excited to do more on it
as we finish out this.
Interim and move into.
Uh, Mr. Chairman, I, I, I really
appreciate what you just said
for a couple of reasons and, and
everyone's input.
So we really need to continue to
work, if you will, with the open
mind, the open discussion and
have, if you will, uh, as we
move forward, uh, the consensus
piece that's gonna be important.
The second part of that as we
move forward is how do we set
those priorities working with
each other and then thirdly, as
we go along with this definitely
is the uh
Uh, an environmental economy
model.
So let's continue to talk about
it, to improve it, and to work
on these type of things and uh
implement what we can with the
resources we have.
And, and to really get there as
a uh.
A formative group that will have
the discussion.
And I really appreciate the
discussion and the civility that
took place this afternoon
because it definitely helped us
in this whole process.
Senator Woods, please. Just
quickly, Mr. Chair, uh,
In, in my thoughts.
We have a lot of volunteers out
there.
Uh, doing a lot of good work.
And
If we are going to have more and
more fires.
And we want these volunteers to
keep working.
We're gonna have to have some
kind of incentives.
Uh, because if you're expecting
them to, to leave there.
Their job, their home.
And go out and and do good work
for the public.
Um, it may not be able to do
everything volunteer right now.
That is, uh,
The duty presented more or less
to the counties.
The counties have to apply for
funds to do.
Anything for a volunteer fire
department in the county has to
come up with uh a lot of extra
monies.
And
We have money.
Through insurance policies that
that fund equipment and
different things and.
It may come to a point in time
where we may have to have more.
Uh, incentives, and you can say
that we, we pay some of those
volunteers.
We don't pay them, uh, I don't
know if any of you tried to get
an EMT license here lately?
It's not easy.
And it comes out of your pocket.
And if you want the public to be
protected.
We need more medical people
trained.
But
More than anything I'd like you
to think just a minute that you
know, 38% of our state is owned
by the federal government.
Now we talked about
You know, the forest we talk
about oil and gas.
Let's face it, the federal
government has a huge influence
on what happens in our state.
And how much say so do we have?
In that
As a state.
We don't get to manage much of
that.
Uh, they determined.
Those oil and gas leases on that
federal property.
Not us.
They determine how much
management.
At the turn of the century,
The, the
Spanish culture
was to run
Sheep
And go
And they get a lot of that under
the brush sheet now.
How many
in the state of New Mexico.
How many goats are in state. I
mean, if you've even eat.
Goat meat.
I.
But
I heard earlier a comment about
uh
Uh, dry weather and more fires.
The only comment I'd make about
that.
Wet weather
Makes fuel.
So you have to have wet weather.
Before you can have fuel.
We fired a bird.
We have wet weathers in New
Mexico. Sometimes they're far
apart.
But things grow.
And
At that point in time, if, if
There's not an agriculturist out
there.
To harvest what grows.
All of a sudden it's left.
For a fire to come by and burn
up.
There's many ways to manage.
And if we really want to manage
our natural resources.
There's plenty of people, smart
people, to tell us what side of
the slope.
To cut the wood on and how to
harvest those trees.
And do that kind of stuff.
One of them sat back there
looking down so she won't notice
me.
But she's uh we, we offer
degrees at Highlands University
on Force management.
It's out there, but I want, the
only thing I really want to talk
about.
Mr. and, and
Mr. Director, is that we really
need to think about
The
The uh volunteer EMTs, the
volunteer firefighters, and what
we can do to cultivate that
society.
To, to help us
In these emergency management
situation.
Both in the hardening of these
homes.
And, and just taking care of the
People that have wrecks out
there and
And nowhere.
Uh, and that's why I argue for
the uh
MEs all the time.
Those guys, you know, we, we've
got.
He trained people out there some
way somehow.
So I'm rambling.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Appreciate it
Senator Woods, to me, you never
ramble. I'm always amazed at
what you come up with.
Representing Wuhan, please.
Thank you, Mr. and thank you for
having me in your, your
subcommittee here. Um, we live
in an interesting time and we
live in a very interesting state
where we have our revenues built
by.
Um,
Oil and gas.
And we have a very unique.
Not unique. We have a situation
and we keep alluding to it or
talking about it maybe directly,
some of us more directly about
climate change.
And climate change is happening
faster than ever.
Um, we have the
The hottest recorded year.
2
23
And I think 2024 is gonna be the
next, and we can, we can assume
that that's going to continue.
Um, there was
A presentation we had in Tain
Rev or respite uh two years ago
regarding what the cost of
mitigating.
These natural disasters and how
frequent they're going to occur.
I was just at a recent
conference held by one of our
members, uh, Representative
Dixon, where they gave the
measures.
And a simulated, um,
Application that they put
together.
What they estimated is that
those, those, uh,
Disasters are going to be
upwards as
Uh, we may see
2 or 3, but in the next decade.
We presume that we'll see 28, 29
or more depending on the the
region and area.
We know these things are coming.
How prepared we are, I think is
part is a huge part of this
conversation. What are we going
to do to prepare? It's gonna
cost billions, hundreds of
billions of dollars.
For us to, to figure this out,
um, in the disaster management.
Arena, Mr. Chair.
Um, I liked a lot of the things
that our director said. I think
he, he really has his finger on
all our budgetary um
Things that we have done and
what we have to do, and, you
know, increasing that that cap
with that $700,000 cap for the.
For the threshold for disaster
relief, I think it's just.
A small part, we're gonna be
seeing legislation where we're
looking at royalty fees and I'll
get back to like my full circle,
like, these are the things we're
dependent on how we're going to
use them to help us to get to
the places we need to go as we
move towards a more renewable
energy.
In our state, cleaner energy in
our states, um.
I think we need to look at some
of those legislation proposals
if that's what you're asking in
this committee if we know that
we've had presentations from
our.
Commissioner Garcia Richard with
their land office where we're
going to look at those increases
in royalties. What are we going
to use those, those fundings
for?
Now is this something this I
would like to maybe tie that to
some of the conversations, some
of the ideas we may be coming up
with.
Uh, there are other ideas I'm
sure, um, and I will look to
your leadership, um.
And those on this committee and
their leadership and our
director to figure that out. But
I know for sure that that
legislation is going to be
moving forward. Do we want to
tie these dollars to that, is
it?
I'm not sure if we can um
director.
An increase in the royalties on
state lands would
Um, increase the revenue for
whichever beneficiary owns that
land.
So if it's for the common
schools and the common schools
would get a bigger uh windfall
from that drilling activity.
So the, so that was under that's
constitutional, then we wouldn't
be able to thank you for
reminding me that um there are
other, there can be other
opportunities for us to look at
what we need to do, but we do
know we need to be prepared. We
do, we do know we need to look
in these areas. I appreciated
the prioritization that you
mentioned, um, Mr. Chair,
through our director.
Because there are communities
like Imora and in Las Vegas
where they're inhabited, you
know, for centuries people have
been living there. So we need to
prioritize what's going on in
those communities where we do
have um
Folks living, so
This is a big, this is a big um
Issue, and we have to really
look at all things that are to
address it fully, so I commend
all this entire conversation and
the input for everybody, but
this is, as we know, is not
gonna go away. We need some big
solutions to a big problem and
I'm just happy to be here and
into your thoughtfulness, Mr.
Chair, you have been working on
this issue for quite a while
now. This is where you're from.
This is your constituency.
In the northern part of the
state where we see the disasters
happening and we know they're
gonna happen again. Really
appreciate your, your heart and
your work and driving and taking
care of this, but with everybody
that has input to date, I
appreciate what we're talking
about, but I, I don't.
I don't know what the ultimate
solutions are, but there was a
really good presentation on
this. It's going to take
billions of dollars, Mr. Chair.
Thank you for letting me ramble.
Thank you.
You don't ramble either. In
fact, I really appreciate the uh
the input to each and every one
of you. I want to thank you very
much and to uh to all of you for
listening to each other. This is
definitely a serious issue as we
go forward. You all will
definitely help in bringing out
some of the options that will be
addressing.
So no further business?
The subcommittee.
is adjourned. Thank you all very
much.
