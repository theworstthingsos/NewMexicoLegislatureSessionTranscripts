Yeah,
why
a
that,
yeah,
>> is where this fund starts
for workforce housing.
That's the goal,
there may be some
unintended overlap uh
potentially
depending on where that upper
limit is and where the mortgage Finance
Authority is. And so
we're looking at that
um potential
overlap. Um
And um
if we take it out, there might
be unintended gaps. So we're
kind of in between
some unintended
overlap or some unintended
gaps. And that's what the
board is trying to work through now
in that definition, but
that's a key definition. It's
not defined in
um statute. So I
wanted to make sure we focused on
when we say middle income, what are we
talking about? So up
to 300% of median
family income, um
and that's a
relatively wide bar. So
Santa Fe County can still have a
project um
in, in particular,
that's, I think they're one of the
highest
um the policies that
we've currently set out
um and
is for the Housing
Development Fund. The
goal is to
prioritize
um and catalyze
below market housing
production across the state.
The Housing Development
Committee focused
explicitly on
the deficit
of dwelling units
that 32 to 40,000
number that we see, we
hear that there are 32 to
40,000
dwellings shy
to meet current demand.
And because there's such a
diversity of what can
be funded with the
housing development fund,
they, we spent a while
trying to say, should
we
have a different set of policies
for affordable
housing, infrastructure versus
workforce housing? How
about multifamily
versus um
single family for sale
versus rental,
um rural versus
urban. It got pretty
complicated, pretty fast.
So focused instead
on projects that could get
completed quickly, that were
really very shovel
ready where they could
um create as much
housing as possible with as little
dollars as possible from that
fund. So we really are
just trying to catalyze
the housing production and
that's what we focus these policies
on.
The other thing is that there wasn't
statewide data that was
readily available. So we
couldn't say in this
community, there's a higher
percentage of
deficits of housing
that that number doesn't
exist for every community. So
we couldn't rely on any outside
data to help
inform these policies. That
was the other reason we
didn't try to split
up, you know, and prioritize
one type of housing over
another.
Um And then lastly,
the board itself articulated
a desire to have these
fund, the that
gap, that closing, you
know, get a project closed
and started. There are a lot
of good projects out there that simply
don't have the complete
funding but are
close that
gap. Um We
could use a little bit of money to
generate a lot of housing
overall, if we focus on gap
lending as opposed
to funding the whole
project, um
sometimes because they can't get
funding someplace else.
So that was a an
explicit direction of
the housing development board.
So again, we don't try to
differentiate anything other
than housing units
as a result, the
criteria, the evaluation
policy that went out for public
comment had 35
points for community
need and alignment and
that is the project's ability
to meet known demand as designed
defined by a market
study. Uh
Projects in
rural communities are awarded
additional points. Uh
projects
located um
near amenities including
public transportation or
creating those amenities
um are offered
points, redevelopment
projects are offered
points. So that's in
projects, adaptive reuse
rehabilitation of vacant
facilities, redevelopment
of vacant properties, all
of that gets points,
there are points for local preference
on either the contractor or
the um developer
themselves. And then there's
some points given for universal
design and that's the
um the design
element that makes the housing
as um
livable for as many people
as possible. So if they're
mobility impaired
um age
and you know, if, if
age somehow
limits their ability to use a
house. Um
So that's universal design.
If they use that they get additional
points, there's
30 points for what we're calling
fund efficiency. And we're
looking at how much leverage we
have of the fund over the overall
project. What the
total funds requested are
per dwelling unit to be
created or the
duration of assistance. So the shorter
the term of the loan,
the more points they
get.
Um we're looking
at applicant need and readiness
again, financial soundness,
qualified development team and project
readiness, particularly as it
relates to zoning and permitting and
site control. Those
are the things that we're most interested
in. And then lastly,
this last part comes from
the law that says that
priority should be given
shall be given to
projects that are
located in communities that
implement um
zoning reforms.
And so we,
we chose to use that as
uh implemented
best practices because
if you're already a community that
offers best practices,
you don't want to be um
you know,
denigrated by at all because
you haven't actually implemented
reforms. So we're looking
at best practices overall.
Um There are up to five
points for incentives,
uh zoning
land use approvals and
allowance for varied housing
types and what we have
are basically a laundry list in
the policies. And if you
meet any of these criteria, then you
get one point
each up to a total of five
points for each of those sections.
So there's a section of best
practices that's available
and that represents 20%
of the potential
policies.
And so Mr Chairman, I would just note
that those are currently
under review July
11th things change again
and we will be back to you in
August with a
report on what the final rule
look like, what the final policies
look like. And then our
request to you
um to look at rules
for the loans
that are made under those
uh under those
programs. And again,
overall, our goal is to
get an application opened by
the end of the summer so that we
can start getting some
um projects
uh secured funding
for and moving
on. And with
that, um John's
also happy to answer questions. He knows
a lot more about the opportune, the actual
commercial development fund than I
do. So that's why I asked
him up here. Um But we're
happy to answer questions.
>> All right. Thank you very much
Marquita and John,
again,
great work moving this thing
along quickly. I was the Senate
sponsor for this original bill and
then now the new changes for
the housing development
portion of it. And I
think this, you're hitting all the key
salient points that we were wanting
you to. So this is terrific.
Um And I think,
you know, the committee is
aware of the
gigantic hole we have
in housing here in New Mexico
that is uh either at
40,000 or just above
40,000 dwelling
units short. And so that's why we
decided to bring this legislation
and to make this enhancement to the
opportunity Enterprise Act.
So you are doing a great job
kind of adjusting and
making this thing work for all of us.
We do have some questions.
Um I'm gonna first go
to if I can read my own writing here,
Representative Aral
Caballero.
>> Thank you Mr Chair and thank
you Marqui and
you, you always
do an amazing job
of explaining things
very well.
So I have
just a couple of, of
points.
Um
First and foremost,
as many of, you know,
I'm a community economic
developer and planner, planner
and developer. And
so from that perspective,
um
on page
eight,
there are uh
under the
highlight of
community need and alignment
up to 35 points.
You're you're familiar
right with the sawmill
uh project here.
So
Mr Chair, the the
sawmill
exemplifies
exactly what I
spent a career doing and
that is creating
um
projects
that address small
business development,
housing,
medical care,
um all within a
walking distance or
within a
reasonable distance,
quality of living
all in
this
promotion of this
project and
not all are gonna fit
or begin, but we begin
in sawmill with the housing
obviously, because
once you're established
in a home then
and and then the the
uh project begins to
um
realize uh
revenue
generating revenue because
the whole idea is to generate
revenue in order for
the project to keep investing
within itself.
So the larger
leverage match
is at the beginning
and then you begin to reduce
that, reduce that, reduce
that until you're self-sustaining
with all of the
business developments and
everything that you've put together
in your project. So
their entire business
incubator actually
is self generating. I
think I'm not
sure what percentage but almost
at completion
or project it.
So
that is in
mortgage Finance
Committee and in wherever
I get to talk or
raise questions,
those are the kinds of
projects that
back in the eighties were
envisioned to
be in full
bloom around
the nation. We're
way behind
my point being
that if
we can visualize or
support
projects
that
are the, you know,
the similar
to the sawmill project,
um then what
happens is that invites
investors
that invites more
funding. And
actually uh Mr
Chair at the Federal level,
the National Federal Level
Housing Level
and Commerce
and a number of
other entities,
they actually prefer
to fund or
finance or promo,
provide funding
to finance
similar projects
and they'll give a higher
amount at the front
end and then begin
to wean the
project
and that's much more
lucrative
than doing the piecemeal
that we've been doing,
particularly in our
state
because what we want
to promote um
is healthy living
in healthy communities.
In order to do that, you have to
have all of these
infrastructure
quality of living
um components
within one
project. So the
kids there, walk to
school can be walked to
school, there's a
clinic on site,
medical facility soon
to be in urgent care
there. So that's the
kind of quality of living
that we had envisioned in the
eighties to already be in
full bloom, but we're behind.
So I only bring
that up because
um
it's just a much better
investment
picture
that we can provide and
invite um
to help our state
uh expend
less money and move them
into areas, move our funds
into areas that
could complement such
developments. So this
is a perfect
holistic
approach. Thank you Mr Chair
by bringing in the
opportunities fund, by
bringing in the housing
fund, by bringing in our
venture funds. Because
everything we've heard today
can all work in
tandem
around a project like
this. But we
you Marqui your office
and we as
representatives and
senators around the state
need to be
promoting these kinds
of developments.
Otherwise we're going to continue
to be behind
and and lag
in terms of
quality of living
circumstances. Because
another final
uh final example in the
sawmill is that you
have intergenerational
living. So
you have grandparents
taking care of the
Children
or you have
intergenerational
um
facilities where they
interact under
one
facility
and that what
better quality of living can you
have? Right, when you have
these kinds of generational
living um facilities
together. So
it it's, it's a
vision. Um
I got excited with it. I
got certified
back in the eighties to
do these projects. There are several
that I was spearheaded
in the region and
it's I came here and
sawmill just was
blew my mind because
that's exactly where they're going.
So anyway, but,
but it necessitates
Mr Chair, all
of
wherever you come to the
table, it means
that we all have to
be focused
on this kind of
promote, promoting these kinds of
developments. Again,
because we don't want to be last in
the education. We don't want
to be la the poorest state in the
nation. We want to get
out of those cycles of poverty
and into these cycles of
opportunity in order
to flourish as a state for
our future. So I just
say that because I know you
see it, Marquita is
a, that's part of your
visionary
um worldview
and I appreciate
that. So thank you, Mr
Chair and thank you for giving me the
opportunity to
speak. Thank you. >> Thank
you, Representative. All very, very good
points. And I, you know, before
we move forward, I, I
just want to say that I attempted
to uh recognize
Senator Griggs multiple times,
but unfortunately, each time I did,
he wasn't in the room, but he's here
now and he's actually next on our
list. And I also want to welcome
Senator Rodriguez who's sitting over there
as well. Long, long time
service to our state, both of these
individuals. Um
But uh instead of uh if
you'd like to introduce yourselves briefly, I think
that'd be great.
I don't want to miss that opportunity.
>> No, thank you, Mr Chairman.
My name is Nancy. I'm
Senator Nancy Rodriguez
from Santa Fe District
24 and I
am here. I came from the health
committee and to, to be here
with our NM FA
thank
you,
>> Senator
Gras.
>> Good afternoon, everyone. My
name is Ron Griggs. I'm from
Alamogordo. I
represent Senate district
34 which is part
of, uh, Eddie and
Otero counties. And
man, I came all the way from
Alamogordo up here just to
be with you
guys.
>> Thank you very much, Senator
and always, always welcome both of you.
Love to see both of your faces. So
I do want to let everybody know we have Senator
Griggs representative Chatfield, Senator
Rodriguez, Senator Gallegos
and Representative Block. So
we'll get through these questions
here in about the next
13 minutes.
Senator
Griggs.
>> Thank you. Thank you, Mr
Chair and mine aren't always
short, but I'll do my best.
Um, a
few, a few years
back, more like about
seven,
Alamogordo had the
opportunity or a
gentleman came to a gordo wanting
to redevelop
the mall in
Alamogordo and
Mr Chair and
members of the committee, there are
malls all
across the state that
need some sort of
uh help either in, in
redeveloping
for
business purposes or
potentially
potentially for
residential purposes.
And I think we don't
think
residential,
but it could be
an opportunity.
Uh, last
session
I uh introduced a
bill which was to provide
a tax credit
to a guy if you wanted to
come in and redevelop
a mall. Well,
that was not
Germane
as it as it turned
out,
but it appears to
me that
if that bill could
be resurrected
by any member of the
committee and
worked on just a little bit
to determine what's the best
way to make it work.
It looks as though Mr
Chair, that that bill
could then
be
not necessarily
incorporated but the
um the Opportunity
Enterprise Development
Fund, in
addition to someone
getting a credit
or getting a deduction
from taxes,
they could also then
potentially apply
for and be
awarded a
grant or whatever
we're doing here through the
Opportunity Enterprise
Fund and uh
Mr Chair and, and Marti,
could you, I mean, would that be
something you, you would
see uh
potentially
melding working
together,
>> Mr Chairman? Um
Yes, I mean, the redevelopment
of vacant facilities
for either new commercial
spaces or new mixed use
spaces or just housing
um are very much contemplated
in these policies. They get
additional points in these areas
because not only do we want to
promote them, but they're often
more expensive to do some
of those redevelopment
projects than Greenfield
development. So we wanted
to provide some
additional points to make
certain that they weren't, you
know, unintentionally put
to the bottom of the list because
we're looking at things like cost
per unit. So
we focused on
those kinds of elements in both
sets of policies to
ensure that redevelopment
projects, infill development
get additional points so that
they're not um
you know, sort of dinged someplace
else because they may be more
expensive.
>> And Marquita, thank you for that.
And, and Mr Chair, one of the
things that
that bill didn't include
were things like
uh big box
stores that have been abandoned
a Kmart or a Walmart
or, or some of those things
that communities,
especially small communities
have a real difficult
time
redeveloping.
So I would
encourage any
member of the committee that you
know, is continuing on
to look at that
bill and
see if it's something that they would
be interested in and could
uh uh could
actually bring
to the table and
possibly uh
possibly pass for the
benefit of, of New Mexico,
which it and then these
things working together
could improve communities
across the state. So
Mr Chair Marquita, thank you
all for that.
>> Thank you, Senator
Representative
Chatfield,
Senator Rodriguez.
I thought I just saw him sitting right
there.
>> Thank you, Representative Chatfield
is out there? Was he anac I'll let
him go first if he still wants
to. Is he
on? We'll come
to him next. Go ahead.
Thank you. Thank you, Senator
Mr Chairman and
Marquita. Good afternoon.
You and John and your staff.
Um As always,
I want to say thank you
profusely never enough
uh for the work
that you do and the way that
you do it, one thing is to be
capable, Mr Chairman,
skilled and knowledgeable.
The other way is
probably more important than anything
is the approach
in all the things that we do in our life,
right? Is how to approach
things and you
do it above and
beyond. Beautiful.
Thank you for all your work and
how you deal with so much
that we give you. We have
spoken several times, Mr Chairman
in the LFC. How
much is given to
the NM FA given
as far as projects go?
Oh, we can't do this so we
can pass this legislation because
NM fa can do it.
Marquita can do it. Let's give it to
Marquita. We just give
you so much and
you're way, way
over your head
really and so much that we give
you but you still do
it graciously and, and so
well, thank you. That being
said, Mr Chairman, I just
have a quick question
on the um
on the enterprise
housing for the housing portion
of it. Uh This would be
for both development
for the workforce, for
example, would be for both
rental and also
homeownership.
Uh So there it's not for
one or the other because sometimes what we
do is we build uh
multifamily dwellings,
but those are like
apartments and so
on. And um
like the ma for example,
we, we do both,
you know, the multifamily and
also for purchase of homes
and so on. So, tell me a little
bit about it briefly, Marquita.
Thank you, Mr Chairman
>> um Mr Chairman
Senator. Yes. So the
workforce development can
be either the infrastructure
to support it and
or the construction
of the actual
dwelling or
multi dwellings and it can be
multifamily, it can be
single family, it can be
rental or it can be
um for sale. So
it's a combination of any of
those things. On the
workforce development side,
it's pretty broad.
>> I see. So basically
the mortgage
finance authority, if
somebody wants a home
built, for example,
and financed, of course, the
finance part goes as we know
through the finance
authority. Um
and they would
work with you and vice
versa and thank you for working
closely with the M fa and for
recognizing the
importance.
Um when you do
that, do you work together
in building the
home? Um making
sure that the family
who is intended to move
into that home,
um qualifies
for, for the amount that is
supposed to be borrowed
and the borrower which is the
family comes directly
to the M fa and
works with you also on some
infrastructure development
for workforce housing.
Is that going to work that way for
that area also? Or just for
low income and median income?
>> You know, we have not madam,
uh Senator
and, and Mr Chairman,
we've not worked through the process
yet again,
having not even completed the rules,
we're sort of at the beginning here.
Um We understand that
they, you know, have some
needs that we could fill pretty well with
these programs. It's not
quite clear whether or not the policies
will ultimately end up supporting
that. Um But our goal is to
facilitate and
catalyze as much
funding as they
can make available for those housing.
So whether it's we come
in together and build
something, but again, I'll
remind you that we have to
determine prior to
us making a
loan that
insufficient funds
exist before
we can make that loan. So
if M fa can fund it
outright,
there's N
MA is going to have to make the
determination that that's
insufficient funding.
So um
we're, we're really
that, that part's tricky for
us. Um And so
we're, we're trying to figure
our way around that, but we've
not had enough close conversations
with MA to tell you how that's going
to work. I will
say that on the affordable
housing side, we will
require, you know, whoever
is going to be construction,
constructing the actual
housing units
will have to have a strong
compliance element in
place. Um Because
we do not wish to be doing
affordable housing compliance,
that's not something we've got
built up and it's not something,
you know, we think would be efficient for us
to build up and ma
has a really good compliance
program. Um If
it's not NMF, it's, if
it's not ma that's actually
doing the construction of affordable
housing, we're gonna have to really
underwrite who, you know, and
understand who's gonna be
doing the compliance for the
affordable housing side.
Um On the workforce
side, we will have
obviously, um
uh because we'll be
constructing the units, we will
have, um,
rate covenants in place
or, or, um, income
limit covenants on the properties
themselves. You'll see that in
the rules that are coming
up to you in August because we
will have elements of that,
you know, baked into our loan
program >> rules.
Thank you. Thank you very
much for that Marquita
and just one point, Mr
Chairman, um more
than not good question, just a
statement having to
do with the information
you gave us Marquita that about
communities, they get
points for
and if I wrote it correctly for a
community uh ref
zoning reforms,
there we go, couldn't think of the
word here. Um And
so I think that's a good
idea because, you
know, sometimes what happens
is that communities
have to get through
the notion
that not in
my backyard. You know,
we all go through that and
in order to have
development, you
have to have some of that
integrated into
um into an area
that, you know,
unfortunately is an
infill that we call it
infill and land use
development. And
so
that's one problem, the pro
the other problem can be
countering that is that many
times communities,
municipalities and counties
have um
they do zoning
but doesn't
fully take into consideration
the the egress and
ingress, meaning the
roads going in and out
of that particular say
subdivision or development
area. And what happens
is that communities around
that development get
infiltrated with
new traffic. And that's
when the clashes come
in between communities
and uh oppositions
to developments,
you know, and a development can be
really good like something like
this. So both
have merit in
that some, you know,
don't want something
in their backyard rightfully.
So because we haven't
demonstrated, I used to be a county
commissioner. So I know I didn't,
sometimes I just didn't look at
that as much as I should have.
Um you know, to look at
the, the roads, the traffic
that's going to be generated for
those that have lived there around there
for a long time. That's not
fair. And,
and um at the same time, we want to make
sure that we can have that development.
But anyway, having to do
with the zoning reforms, I'm hopeful
that the communities,
counties, municipalities and so on
will be inclined
to uh revisit their
zoning loss to
accommodate um a
few more developments within
the right areas and
so on. But thank you, Mr
Chairman. I don't have any other questions.
I know time is of the essence.
Thanks. >> Thank
you very much, Senator and just as a side
note, so, Representative Dixon
and I represented the
legislature and the governor's housing
investing um
council as you know, and
one of the key discussions was around
this whole challenge of
zoning at the local level.
And so I would imagine there's gonna
be a lot of continued discussion
on that. So thank you for bringing up that
point. Uh We'll go to Senator
Gallegos
>> Mr Chair. Thank you,
MS Russell. Appreciate it. So
I've just got a couple of questions.
Uh We do subdivisions or
we've done in the past.
I think we've got 77
lots. The city
and county Lee, County
and Sea Hobbs would give
us an $8000
increment at
occupation. Uh So
what we're doing is uh
to make it affordable
the lot, let's say it's
$40,000 on
the base sale of the house. It
would be 32,000
so that the money didn't
come to, to us, it would
justs in the housing on
your proposal. Are
you guys doing it by
square foot of the house? How
are you determining the
loan? And
I would think it would have to be
before the building
of the house, not after
because the contractors
gonna want their money upfront
or as needed.
But the loan part would
be done by square
foot. And is there
Cap
>> Mr Chairman? Um
there is a cap currently
in the loan uh
policies.
Um And I believe
that's a $20 million
currently $20
million again because it
could be large-scale infrastructure
project that we're trying to clo close
the gap on. Um
My sense is though that
uh those
projects unless they're supporting
a lot of housing are
likely not gonna get prioritized
very highly because
we're looking at efficient
leverage. So if you're more than
30 if you're asking for
more than 30
or 35% of the
total project, you're
probably not going to get very highly
prioritized. Um
But we will be looking at feasibility
studies to help support the
cost of the housing, the loans
will be done on a construction loan
basis so that the contractor,
you know, can draw down the funds
as needed to complete the, the
housing or
the infrastructure. >> Well, thank
you for that Mr Chair and
um M Russell. So
with that
percentage be given to
the city of the
county. Uh so
units where I live, uh
they're looking at doing a gated
community for housing
just because of the location of
it. And I know
one of the problems they're having is
infrastructure as far
as water and sewer.
And I was wanting to give
them a copy of the
packet, but that
would go directly to them or
does it go to the developer?
>> Um Mr Chairman, the loan goes
to the um developer
who's creating, who's building
the infrastructure and they
are required to pay back that
loan. So it's 100%
loan uh from this,
from this program.
>> Ok. And I appreciate that.
That was my last question because I
was trying to figure out how
we
facilitate this if we are
going to do something they
in Unis
and it would come to us and then
we would charge it on
the >> and Mr Chairman, I'll
remind you that our public project
revolving fund, which is our
Infrastructure bank fund and
it's, it's the most robust
program we have because we're able
to go out to the bond market
and replenish the funds.
Um It's a AAA rated
program Senate
bill 216 carried by
Senator Rodriguez
um
amended the
P pr F to
explicitly add housing
as an eligible use.
So we can now
fund housing loans
for cities and counties
um and other local
jurisdictions. And
then it also added as
an eligible
applicant,
nonprofit housing
developers.
So that may be the other
way that some of these projects depending.
And there's a lot of mix out there
during the break. I was asked
about the potential for
nonprofits to access
this housing development
fund and they're absolutely
eligible. Um But
it's only got 100 and 25
million, which is a lot until you
actually do some projects.
Um But the the
public project revolving
fund has capacity
to do 3 to $400
million a year. So
it's gonna be limited only by
their ability to repay the loan
and not by actual
scarcity of funds on our
project side. So if
there's a nonprofit developer
or a city or county that's looking
to support the infrastructure
directly, that's definitely a
place that they can go as long
as they have legislative
authorization.
>> Thank you for
that
Mr Russell and I still our
ha for humanities
because I do a lot in
the area and that would be a really
good
option for. So with
that all you. Thank
you.
>> OK. Thank you very much, Senator
Representative Block.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. Thank
you uh Marquita. Thank you
John. And uh I would say
Alamogordo is very well
represented on this committee.
We've got two members here today,
so we're, we're pulling our weight
here. So
Mr Chairman, uh
I had a few questions for you
guys. I might just spit them all
out at one time and then
you guys can write them down and
then figure them out or
I could just do them one at a time,
whatevers quicker for
you. So OK,
sounds good. So, first,
uh regarding webinars,
can you send us
links to those?
Because I'd love to provide
that to the local Chamber of Commerce
and other people who might be
involved in that
for this fund.
And then secondarily second
round uh which
projects were selected and do we
know specifically in the
second round for the, I think it was the
O B we were talking
about,
was it the ones that I saw
earlier this year? I
think it was like a boba tea and
then we had a, we had like
solar farms, things like
that or if
there is a, a list, I would love to
see that. Um
Next Mr Chair
uh on the
O
fund
requirements, uh location
and building type or 25
points. So that
helps rural areas.
How does that differ from the
current rules
under the O
B?
Uh let's see. And
these are, I believe you said those were
just proposed.
So I don't know if they've been
fully implemented
yet. Um
And then Mr Chairman, another
question I had
was
what
pise
a rehabilitation of vacant
facilities. This is under the
H
DRF.
So in
Almog Gordo, we have a lot of
older houses. Some
of them are actually being abated by
the city. Some of them are just
abandoned houses. I I
know there are a few lots
that are for sale. So
if I was a developer and I
wanted to fix up
a house and then sell
it and flip it.
Would I be eligible for
any of these funds
since it's such a small
project? Uh Would
it be higher on the
list or would it
even be in contention
for that kind of thing if I
was, let's just say in my
neighborhood, if I had
three houses, I wanted to
fix up and then make
them affordable housing
and then resell them on the market,
would that be eligible for
that kind of thing? Even if
you want to make it like a duplex,
for example or
something else. So
those are all the questions I spread
it out to you guys and
thanks for the answers
in advance. >> So
Mr Chairman, um we'll
absolutely get you all the
links to the webinars. I
believe you were um emailed
when we, we posted
for public review and
comment our rules and policies.
We've been trying to work on getting
those great um
suggestions that you all made early
on. So we've really been working. If
you're not receiving our emails, please let
us know. Um Round
two oar was not the list
you saw earlier. This
list was determined relatively
recently. May 2nd.
Um There are six projects being
reviewed and oh my God, if
I can read them, uh they include
a pecan farm as a rural
project um
in
uh
Los. Thank you Donna
County. Um There's a
place, something called
Independent Nation
um down in Donna
County that's a kind
of a outdoor community
workspace real
estate project. John
knows it very well. Um
There's a project in
um Donna County
again.
Um
Ibis a Development
LLC. OK.
He's saying yes. Um
There's midtown Santa Fe
production
LLC which is
in Santa Fe County, uh
Film Yard LLC
which is in Bernalillo
County, um
and Garrett
Development Corporation
uh which is a build
to suit manufacturing facility
in Albuquerque and
then mcdermott Sports LLC,
which is in Rio Rancho.
So those were the 72 in
urban communi uh rural
communities and
those are on the top three
and the rest in
urban
and I will send you this packet
happy to send it to whoever wants
it. It's better to
actually open it on your computer where
you can expand it because
I've now challenged myself.
Um So those are the projects that are currently
being underwritten as we
speak.
Um
The job creation
um portions
that used to be in the, the
commercial Development Fund
because we were trying to both
gauge construction
jobs and then jobs of the
future business occupant. It
became very convoluted
and not consistent in
the data. So what we
did was take out job
creation as an
element and insert
as proxies the
kind of building that's being
constructed, the size
of the building and the amount of the
investment in the building
as proxies for both
that commercial, the
construction jobs and
the, the um permanent
jobs if you will or the jobs to be
created. So it's a combination
of those things. Um
Those all are in the
proposed
policies, July
11th is when the board is
scheduled to meet to go through
both the finalization of
the rules and
the policies for both of those
programs.
And then lastly, the rehab of the
vacant facilities
is it is technically
going to be eligible. I don't
think it's likely going to score very
highly because they're
likely gonna want 100%
funding. Um
And the cost of the funding
for, you know, for three homes,
this, the amount it's spread over
is likely not gonna prioritize
them very high. We're looking for
as a gap
funding to,
to kind of develop as quickly
as possible as many units
as possible that fall either
within that um
affordable
housing or
in um workforce
development. Um
So that unfortunately is
not, I think gonna be,
you know, I'd love to have a program like that,
but, but there's
not likely gonna prioritize
well, and I think I
got all of them.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and Marquita,
you did great, like always.
So I would just
reaffirm, I would love to see
a program like that or
maybe something under M
fa regarding
those older houses
that have been abandoned that are
on the market because I know
where I live there are so
many houses that are just
vacant. And I
think if we would increase
the number of people flipping these
houses, we would
do wonders
for communities like mine.
And I'm sure that's also in Albuquerque
and across the state. So
that's very good. And I
think uh regarding job
creation, that's good that you, you
put that on a fast
track to make sure
that we have that many
houses built.
And then also regarding
units because that is also
huge. But I don't want to just build
a bunch of little ugly boxes.
I want these to be houses that
people can live in for, for
years instead of just
uh like a transitional
housing, I guess you'd call it.
But uh yeah, I think that
that's really good and I appreciate
the the answers and
I appreciate the
restructuring of the
O B and
everything. But I would love to
see more rural
communities just
uh touching off of the ones that you
talked about. Which two
projects were in rural areas? Were
they both the Donnie Anna
or where were
those Mr
Chair?
>> The two projects that are in the
rural area is
one independent nation
that's in Sunland Park
and then the
other one? Oh my gosh, this
is
small
and the other one is
um I
bisa but I
think that's in
um Santa Teresa.
>> Ok. So both and Don Anna.
Ok, great. Thank you
both so much. I appreciate it. Thank you
Mr Chairman for the time?
>> OK. Thank you very much. Representative
Vice chair, Representative
Garrett.
>> Thank you Mr Chair. One very
practical question.
So we heard
from the
um bioscience Authority.
So in light of the projects
that were selected for the
uh opportunity enterprise revolving
fund, would it be accurate
to say that their planning
and building funds to
develop the wet lab and the Incubator
Accelerator Space
could be a project that could
apply for that money.
Is, am I understanding it?
Right? >> Um
Mr Chair, a representative.
That is correct. So I, I
believe that they will
qualify under
the new set of
policies as a
spec development,
>> right? Thank you because I, I
told
that they should have a three hour
meeting with New
Mexico Finance Authority. Thank
you very much. That's it.
>> Thank you madam vice chair and thank
you for the presentation. I
just love what
you're doing here. As I said, I was
happy to sponsor the original bill, this
one, the ads or whatever I
do want to know.
Um Are you or
how often on the housing front?
Are you working in, in, in
concert with ma
mortgage Finance
Authority?
>> Mr Chairman? They um sit
on the
Izzy sits on our
housing
Development committee
and has been able to see the policies.
Unfortunately, we started the rules
before he was an actual board
member. He did attend as a
guest and we were able to
get some, but our, our new
housing board members did
not start until about
May 15th. Um
And so what we had
to initiate the rules before
that as a result,
what we've asked Mortgage Finance
Authority to do is to provide
public comment
on the any proposed
changes to the rules which they have
done and they are mostly
clarifying. I think there's only
one question the board will need
to work through. But everything else that they've
done, of course is very
constructive and clarifying
language, more definitions and
things. So they've been very
helpful frankly, we looked
a lot at their policies and trying
to define,
um you know, looked at
their point system which is well-developed.
So we, we tried to learn from
their experience
um
uh kind of offsite.
Uh We spend a lot of time on their
website. They've
got a lot of great programs and they've
done things really well. So we tried
to learn from their experience
and they have been providing
very helpful comment,
but so far not a working
relationship, Mr Brooks
>> Mr Chair. Also, we have
been working with their
uh their lending
team to develop
our proposed
loan structure and policies
for the housing portion.
So we've had, we've
had several
conversations with the their
lending team. >> That's
really great. I just want to make sure,
uh you know, I
had a one person, you know, what
kicking contest this, I wasn't
one person but uh on
that housing office, we were trying to create.
So we want to lean heavily
on M fa to help them with
their work. And, and like you, I think
it's great. I was hoping you would
say they have a ton of research and
analysis that can just fit
like a glove into what you're doing in this
component of this legislation.
So, thank you very much for that. I
would like to see
the uh the, I'm
just going to ask the committee to
kind of listen in here
because we're going to be asked to do a few
things I think at the next meeting.
So when you have the
document ready, please get
it out to our committee
director as soon as possible
so that we can get that to review
it and understand it before we act on
it at the next meeting.
Well, but there's still some
edits. I think this isn't
completely
approved or it is
>> Mr Chairman. So the things that we've
been talking about so far have
been their policies and the rules
for the actual
opportunity, enterprise
board, what you will
see in August, what
we're hoping to bring to you in. August
are the rules for the Finance
authority for the rules. We need to make
loans and so we
need amendments to the
and I think they're going to be modest
amendments to the
Commercial Development Fund
rules and then brand
new rules for the housing development.
Those are the ones that's talking
about the way the Finance
Authority does this is we, we
try to develop the policies and
rules together so that the
rules represent the parameters
and the policy are things that may
be driven by market conditions
that might have to move a little bit.
So that's so we hope to
have a draft of the policies in front of
you when you look at the rules so
that, you know, kind of what you're,
what you're voting on and what it will look
like >> that. That's
wonderful. I just want to make sure the committee
has plenty of time to review
and understand. Ask, be ready to ask
questions when we get together again.
Thank you. I think this is
moving along just, just the way
we were hoping,
get the money out the door,
let's get these houses built
and whatever it is that we need to get going
there. Thank you very much. All
right. So I want to draw the
committee's attention
to item
number five on the agenda
that's on the backside of the blue sheet
of paper that you have in front of you.
We're going to go to item number five,
which is also uh Marquita
Russell, uh
CEO of New Mexico Finance
Authority, Fernando Martinez,
Deputy Director of New Mexico Finance
Authority. He's making his way up
to the table for the New
Mexico Finance Authority,
innovative tools and I will
let the committee know just
um that I had approached
NM FAA while
ago and we just
thought, why don't we put this as an agenda
topic on
what are some other creative,
innovative things that we're seeing around
the country, around
the world, whatever it may be
that can continue to add more
tools to your tool belt, to get
things done and get moving money moving
here in New Mexico for the things we need
for. So we'll hand it back
over to you Marqui if you want to
take the reins.
>> Certainly, Mr Chairman and
more
to Senator Rodriguez's
comments early on, you know, we've
been given some unusual programs
that we didn't expect to see.
Um but I have
a team Fernando
joining me about three months
ago, Donie Quintana
joining about three months ago
to in our uh
in our project
oversight area. Um We
have a really strong
team. Uh I think
we are budgeted for 77
individuals um this
fiscal year. So
we've grown, you don't see very
many of us, but we've grown a
lot in the last couple of
years to kind of meet
the demand that you the
the bar that you've set for us
and >> the work that you do. Marquita
with the few number of people that you have
really is remarkable. So great
job kudos >> to you. Thank
you. So, Mister Chairman, I
will go directly to page
three and that's that
long list of things that I
always provide you with, which is our
current list of authorized
programs. This does not
include any of the things that we
do pursuant to MOAs
that we may have. So, for
instance, these last two years,
we ran programs for the
early childhood education
and care department, we administered
funds for them.
Emert has come to us and
asked us to administer some funds
that they get. Um, there's
a small revolving fund
that they want us to administer.
They were, you know, authorized
to do some other programs that
they frankly aren't set up to
do. So we enter
into these agreements with our
sister agencies to uh
kind of help them deliver
one time dollars fairly
regularly. Um But
the statutes that are
in place, the programs that we have
um pursuant to statutes are
listed here on page three.
And the reason I want to draw your attention
to this is that we actually do a
number of fairly innovative
things in uh New
Mexico. So if you look
at the national,
um
then
can you hear me
>> sorry for the committee and thank you
to the presenters. Do you
hear that noise, that buzz or
that something going on there?
Uh They're trying to find out what it
is and trying to get it turned down a
little bit.
Ok. Well, then we would be
in an oven here
if we didn't have that on, I guess. So, I'd rather
have non oven
to that noise. So. Ok.
Thanks. >> Cool and vibrating.
So, Mr Chairman, if you look
at the national
landscape of the programs that are
offered from what we call development
finance agencies. We
have a number of programs that
are really quite innovative.
The PRF though, it
doesn't sound like it because it's
just an Infrastructure Bank.
Um the way it structured, the
ability for us to actually
make loans from available
cash on hand and then
replenish those loans.
Uh We plen that fund
by issuing bonds and
having ready access to the market
is an unusual
element for Infrastructure
Bank. Um And a lot
of them, you know, take on more
interest rate risk. It's,
it's just different and it's a
robust program.
And so I say that because there's
a lot of things that we've talked about
today um that
can already be funded from the
public project revolving fund
and it's a really good tool for
us to remember that can be
there uh for those programs.
Um We talked this
morning about the venture capital program.
Um the state law that
you passed the from
last year, the
changes to that law
make it um innovative
in that we can do flexible debt
programs, we can
do um
uh direct investments,
we can do a
bunch of things that many
state programs like ours
are quite jealous of.
Um And so the differential
rate environment that is a
tool that's quite innovative
and I'll touch on one program that we
could offer from that program.
Uh That might be more helpful in the
landscape.
Um John will talk
a little bit about SS BC
I funding this afternoon
and we just talked about opportunity,
enterprise, both the sort of
makerspace um
program and the workforce
development housing. So the
legislature has already created
a number of innovative
tools and there are a number
of programs and authorization
that we have that could be quite
useful. What New Mexico
tends to lack is
capital in any of those
pockets. So we have a
lot of pockets but not a lot of
money in any of these pockets.
And that's what limits the use
of the program ultimately
is that if there's not a predictable
source of capital, it's very
difficult for, for people
to plan around it. So
when Senator Gallegos
mentioned that he has that
nonprofit developer
in his
community knowing
that the PRF is there
and it is a predictable
source of capital for him
that it won't, it's not
scarcity attached to it. The
application go out the
door before someone even knows
about the application is
a really important element. And
P Pr F is the one program
we have that has that
horsepower. So I just wanted
to mention that um because
it is often overlooked.
Um But when we talk to other
states, they're really quite envious.
Um I'll turn you to page
four to mention that there are two reports
that we have done over the past couple
of years and you've heard
presentations. Um
One in uh I think
Santa Teresa,
no, Chaparral. Um
a couple of years ago,
um it was
a New Mexico access to
capital report that we had
drafted. Um
We, we hired the Council
of Development Finance Agencies
to look at
the development
finance tools available in New
Mexico, not just through NM
FA but through
the Environment Department.
Uh M fa
um economic
development D fa all
of those have programs that
fund projects that
can stimulate um
economic development, uh
whether it's capital or
others. Uh
So we asked them to take a look at
what we had and what we lacked
just in terms of um pure
states. And they, they came up with a couple
of recommendations, but they
ultimately, they looked at public
resources, they
spent a lot of time on websites
and they determined that we don't have
any coordination amongst all of our
websites. Um But the
goal was to sort of advance
um the conversations
about how to best support capital
access and improve
vitality last
year, as I mentioned, uh I
think uh I think
actually an entire year ago
in July of 23 we
met in this very room and you
heard the first draft of
a report from Next
Street. Um They had,
we commissioned them to do a
report on the New Mexico
Business ecosystem
landscape. We asked
them to look at the
business, um
the businesses in New
Mexico and
find out what their capital needs
were so, so sort of the other
side of what we asked CD FA to
do CDA A, we said,
what do most states have? And
here we said, what do our businesses need?
Who are our businesses
and what do they need? Um
And I've got that data here. I don't
plan to really talk about it, but if
you weren't available last year, these
are the highlights of, you know,
how small our businesses
are and what a significant
percentage of businesses
fall in the area that we
tend to call no man's
land um because they're
too large for, for
CD Fis or micro
lenders and they're often too
small for banks. So they fall in
this gap in between.
Um And I don't know that I've got a
lot of suggestions for that, but
you know, some of the tools that we've already
talked about or that John will talk
about today um
again, can hit some of
those but not at the levels
that are needed. Again, it's a capital
issue.
Um
So I just wanted to mention those
two reports. Uh The
takeaway from CD fa
again, that was the one that was
looking at our, at the program
level.
Um
And I'll just go right to page six
because I don't want to waste your time with
uh process questions.
Uh But the first thing they said
is please reform your capital outlay
process. Um It is
a significant uh
tool. It's got a lot of
firepower. Um But
because it's not
being done on
a be
because they can't rely on certain
programs that predictability leads
to success model.
Um You don't know if you're
necessarily gonna get funded. If you're
gonna get funded for the full amount,
it makes it
difficult for projects to
plan on capital, being
available to build their project
around. So that was one
thing. Um
The
uh selection
again, this was from just
looking nationally.
Um not having
a sort of needs based assessment
was also an interesting perspective
from them. Um
And they thought that that
would be better in the hands of people
that can accept applications
and establish priorities.
Um So, you know, it
was their first recommendation
and I know it's not a popular
one, but I just thought I should mention that
relative to
other states a
they don't have capital outlay
and if they did, I think they would,
they would do it slightly differently.
Um The other thing they
said was to increase the
flexibility of your programs.
Um And we've done that.
Um Here, we've,
you've worked. You've
been very supportive of
amending some of our programs to
make them actually useful for the
um audience that we're trying to
hit, adding working capital in
particular, making the
adjustments to the
um uh venture
capital program so that we can
explicitly do um
uh differential rate
investments and really make it
an economic development tool.
Uh You've approved rules
last year that allow us to
do uh to
deliver the state small business
uh credit
initiative funding in innovative
ways using the capital access
program. Um
You, you've given us great
tools to help increase
the flexibility and to
maximize the use of the
programs. So we've been able
to really hit a lot of the targets,
the programs they suggested
um included the capital
access program which we are once
Treasury approves it able
to start on,
um there's a food focus
revolving loan fund that they thought should
be happening and I know there's a small
one over at Edd. So we
potentially as a state
hit that program.
The one thing that we don't do in
New Mexico is any
real state support of
agriculture projects.
Um Other states have
uh issued sort of uh what they
call Aggie bonds. Those are first
time um
farmer kinds of
loans. Um And
they, there's federal funding to
support those, there's no
funding to support
potentially the movement
of um a, a crop
from a more water heavy
crop to a less
water intensive crop
um or to modernize
irrigation systems,
those dollars don't exist for
agricultural businesses in New
Mexico. Despite the
fact that we have such a high percentage
of agriculture in New
Mexico. So we have a lot
of federal programs that
support it, but really not any state
programs, uh
broadband infrastructure and
clean energy projects, which are very
much I think on the, the forefront
of you all. Um on
page seven again, just
to note that um
just as a snapshot of New
Mexico businesses,
100 and 67
almost 100 and 68,000
New Mexico small businesses
have fewer than 50
employees. Um And
that's 75% of
and 75% of them don't have
any employees. So we're
talking about very small
entrepreneurs in the state.
Um
76% of the
businesses that actually have
employees have fewer than 10
employees. Um And
that's about almost half
of the private employment in
New Mexico
and 42% are
in um small business
are in rural communities.
Um So I just wanted to hit that.
Those are a lot of
very small businesses in our state.
You all know this quite well.
On page eight, banks
have not been in a position to meet the
capital needs. I don't
say that to denigrate in any
way what banks are doing,
it's difficult to lend in this
environment and the smaller the
project frankly, the more difficult
some of those get um
And so it's, you'll
see on that chart at the
bottom that 10 years
ago, there was
a lot more funding available
by banks than there are today.
Again, a lot of that is a
regulatory environment
issue. Um But there's
also been some decrease
in footprint because it's harder to
be a bank than it used to be.
So there's a decrease in footprint
in some of these small
communities.
Um And then lastly on page
nine, and I can get you this full
chart. It's um
again, if you're interested in the
entire presentation.
Um but it's about a two hour
presentation. I don't
plan to do that.
Um uh
This
focuses on
where small businesses are currently
getting their capital.
Uh We have in New Mexico,
a high percentage of, of
um credit unions
and CD Fis that are
lending to your small businesses.
Um Again,
we're very blessed to have them.
It's simply not enough to
meet the needs of those
100 and 67,000
businesses.
The focus
that we came from.
Uh the takeaway, the
main takeaway we had from the next
street report is that
businesses were just having a hard
time finding that right size so
they could go to a micro lender
and get half the capital they
needed. Um And they likely
couldn't get to a bank to get all
of what they or more
than what they needed because it's, it's
falling between that
$600,000
mark that we've been calling
that no man's land. And
so there aren't enough micro lenders
that lend as high as most
small businesses may need some
of our more established small
businesses. Some CD
Fis are doing that, but we don't
have a statewide presence for
CD Fis.
Um And
that's really what I wanted to hit there. And
then lastly on page 10,
um to remind you
of that funding
landscape, starting
with the idea and seed
stages which we are now hitting
with some of our venture capital
programs um
that start up cash to take
an idea and turn it into
um uh you
know, a prototype of a
project early
stage, developing those
programs, growth stage and
maturity stage. Our banks
are coming in, you know,
certainly in the maturity stage,
some of them are there in the growth
stage. Um
If they've got some access
to some credit
enhancement,
um This John
talks to you later about our economic
development revolving fund. These
are some of the things that we're trying to
hit our state small
business credit initiative
project for capital access.
That's the loan insurance
pool that you all approved rules for last
year and the loan
participation. So the smaller
the business
um the more likely they'll
use that insurance pool,
the larger more mature
businesses will likely go with the
loan participation if a
bank in fact needs
some credit enhancement
and I would hasten to mention
that um in Economic
Development Department offers
programs as well, that kind of puts
in between those two programs.
Um So we're starting to
fill some of the gaps with the
programs that we've talked to that
we either have talked about or we
talk about today. Um
And so, you know, kudos are to
be given um to the legislature
for some of these,
they come from us, these ideas
did not come from the Finance
Authority. I'd like to say we're visionaries
but we're not. Um So we're
the stewards of the capital, who you've
invested in us, you all have
come up with some really interesting
ideas and we were happy to play a
part in that. Um
Again, capital
ultimately is gonna be
uh the determinant
of success here because we can
only make so much impact with
uh some of the dollars that we
have.
Um the
key takeaways ultimately is
funding. Uh There are some
barriers to access,
which is to say that some of
these um micro
lenders, some of the state
lenders are not located
statewide. And so we
do have to figure out a way to
use technology
and more intermediaries
to get to these small businesses
without a doubt. We
are not hitting all the
business communities we need to
hit. Um
I note that a lot
of uh technology driven
or fintech, they call them uh
businesses are, are
tools that more
development. Finance
agencies are turning to
as a way to reach those
underserved businesses. A
lot of equity and diversity
lending is happening through
these fintech
businesses. Um And there
are models for success that we
should really learn from.
So we're starting to really focus
on that, which they're doing
in some of these other
nationally.
Um What I wanted to hit
on today was
uh we, I talked
earlier about the need
for CD
Fis and micro lenders
and the role they're playing to help fund
your small businesses. But
many of them are starting to
tap out in terms of what they
can leverage because
they don't have a big enough equity
base. One of the
things we can do with
our um venture
program is
to make what they call equity
equivalent
investments in
nonprofits. So you
can't, you know, nonprofits
have no shareholders, they don't have
owners. So you can't
make an equity investment in
something that you can't get an equity
a share uh in.
But you can make
long term deeply
subordinated loans
to the CD FIS that
will, where they will pay interest
over time. Um
and they will eventually repay
the loan. But they
are, it's seen because it's so
deeply subordinated,
it's seen as equity
that allows for some of these other
programs that exist out there like
SB IC
to leverage more capital
into the CD FIS.
So expanding that base would
be a really important tool
and that is one way that we
could um help
that. So you've got some existing dollars,
you've got some existing capacity,
but because it's not
be because they're not rightly
aligned and the CD
Fis need more equity. This
may be a way to, to target
that um
those would not be
Highmark uh
investments. You're not gonna get
a large return on that,
but you'd get a consistent return
and the economic development return
would be significant because
micro lenders play a
very important part
in the lives of small
businesses. So I
just wanted to mention that and
then um there
are other um business and
housing um
CD Fis that we could help
start up as well. And CD
Fis again, not trying to
take the place of banks but
trying to support,
um, in the small businesses
where banks really aren't,
aren't able to
lend, um, either
efficiently or because of, you know,
the, the size
of an, um and then
lastly to increase the amount
of funding directed
to flexible debt products,
some of them are called character
loans. But there are, you know,
through our, um, equity
loans, equity
programs, we're doing more
of these that are event driven.
You have somebody that's got a
contract, they don't
yet have enough collateral to
meet it. They've got a good business
plan, they've got experience,
they don't have the capital.
So those debt programs we talked
about earlier today from the
venture capital program,
we're able to meet some of those
needs through those tools,
but we will ultimately only have
about 20 million to
put into that. And so it
may, um you know,
more capital, there would
be uh more
businesses helped in the long
term and those are fast turns of
dollars.
So I wanted to just get through the
existing sets
of programs that we
have. Um
some of the information
we already know that's available
and then hit um
some on some of the other things,
the tools to facilitate
infrastructure investment.
Um And I mentioned that because
there are,
I mean, we're not alone,
public infrastructure
is increasingly
being built and
constructed by private
entities. And
so one of the tool, one of
the issues that we have is
how you get a private
entity, enough capital to build
the infrastructure for an
economic development or housing
development project. They're just,
they're not enough site
ready, infrastructure ready
sites for these kinds of economic
development tools, whether they're
industrial parks or
you know, sites for large
um warehousing or
manufacturing or, or
even housing. So
we, we have a need to
get infrastructure dollars out
to these communities if we want
economic development to
occur. And there are so few
tools for,
for profit or even nonprofit
developers in that
realm. Um We
have a couple of them, we have special
assessment districts and public
improvement districts. Those
make, they're sort of
developer driven
quasi governmental
um entities that are able to
access capital.
Uh They can do so through the public
project revolving fund.
Um Our neighboring states have
things called municipal utility
districts which make them slightly
easier to do those same kinds of
projects, fewer red
le less red tape to go
through.
Um We have tax
increment for development districts.
Um Again, we're
able to repay
loans for the
infrastructure uh
from incremental tax
revenues that are generated by the
project. Um
Those aren't, you know, every
state has those I would
mention again that the public project
revolving fund is a place
where you can, those
special assessment districts,
public improvement districts
and t are able
to get funding for the
infrastructure. So
those are the, it's
not innovative, but it's not really
thought of very
often
another way that we can do
this. Um And there are
so many charts that could go to
this, we chose not to put them
all up. We actually, we chose not to
do any of them because they're kind of
confusing. Uh but
the concept of a lease backed
security is one that other
states have done
with a great deal of success.
Very similar to the public
project revolving fund
where you will have
infrastructure that may
support a number
of um
uh projects.
You might have leases from three
or four places if you're
a lender, the last thing you want
to do is
actually underwrite all
the ultimate beneficiaries
of a project, all the
final tenants of a project
or all the individuals
that are gonna sign long term
leases. Um
That's the beauty of the public
project revolving fund.
Uh When we sell bonds, our
investors are not looking
at every one of those loans
that we're reimbursing. They're
ultimately looking at the
credit of the Finance authority
and how we structure our
loans and kind of
aggregate portfolio
data AAA
That kind of that same
kind of concept really does exist
with these um lease
backed securities. So what we're talking
about is having
an entity, could be someone
like the public, like the P
Pr F and the Finance
authority through the PR F
with legislation
that could lease a
project from a private
entity and
then uh the, those
dollars that
the strength of the P pr
F could serve
as the credit so that they
can get that cap um
funded in the capital markets.
So they don't have to go through an agency
like NM FA they can
fund that infrastructure project
a for profit.
Um Because the NM FA
would be acting as
the master um
uh leasing agent and then
we would have underlying
um uh
leases in place
with
towns um
cities, that sort of thing. So
that's one way in which the project
could get done. Another
way is that you have entirely
another entity acting as
that leasing agent. And
the NM FA through the P
pr F could provide
a guarantee that the
ultimate tenants, local
government tenants, we
were in a position to actually
repay the loan. So we
guarantee the first
several years of a
loan. Um
And then lastly, the other one
is um and that's again
using a lease structure.
Um And then lastly, what we get
asked about pretty regularly are
guarantees. Um And
by that, we mean someone
there's a someone willing to fund
it. Can we put a, a first
loss reserve in or
can we guarantee the first
several years that the loan
is in place until the the thing
stabilizes? And that's for
infrastructure projects as
well. We see them for
businesses, we see them for
infrastructure. So those are
requests that we get
for housing and other things
um that would be
helpful. All those
are, you know, the only
pot of money we have available
for, to be
creative with and we can't
get too creative because there's bond
holders involved is
that public project revolving
fund we have in
our current rules, the ability
to guarantee debt, but we
don't have, we've never really
used it. Um
And so there, you know, there is some
flexibility there, should
we find
ourselves in a position to
uh need to facilitate
more private
investment into public
projects?
Um
And then I skipped over P
threes from purpose.
Um So page
12, P threes
are kind of an interesting term because
they mean a lot of different things to
different folks. Um
But it ultimately is
a way for um
transactions
um that
have a public purpose and a
public use for
them to be um
funded between a partnership
or um
developed between a partnership
of a private entity and a public
entity. So there's risk
sharing, there's a
reward sharing in
this entity, in this
uh
particular
um
relationship
most states have
enabling legislation in place.
You've heard this before, there's
many um P
three bills before you.
Um They're typically
starting with transportation projects
because that's where you get the biggest bang for
your buck. We don't
have legislation in place, but
we also, but we already have
some tools in place.
So we don't call them P three
Bills. Uh We don't call them
P three programs,
but several existing
programs are in
fact true. Public
private partnerships, the New
Mexico Rita, which you
know, Fernando just most recently
came from is
truly a public
private partnership entity.
Um The finance
authority through the opportunity,
lease assistance is
a P three
entity. Uh We
have the ability to construct
a project
and own it and operate
it. Um But we would select
a developer who would come in
and develop that project.
So that is a public
project. There's a public use
for it. Uh With the
private entity coming in with some
portion of the risk and some
portion of the reward
on page 12.
Um I've shown you just a
continuum of
the kinds of projects that
are available through A P three
different, different
risk involved and different
reward involved. But
generally speaking, the
longer the project
goes, the
more the
longer the life of the project,
the more the risk
is borne by the private
entity. So if your
very first thing is just a
design build,
that's a short term
participation by a private
entity. I'm gonna hire you to
design the building and construct it for
me. At the end, you're done.
If you're looking at towards the
other end of the spectrum
where you design it, you
build it, you help finance
it, you operate it,
you maintain it, you're gonna
have a very different approach at
designing that building. If you know
that you're gonna be operating it
over the useful life. If you're
there for 20 years,
you're going to be far more
efficient and make
sure that it is built in a very
sturdy manner since you're gonna bear
the cost of operating and maintaining
that building over time.
So there is a, there's a risk
and reward um the
uh balance and the
longer it goes out, the
more the risk is borne by
the private entity,
the shorter, the more the risk is
borne by the public
entity. Um
But typically these things go
for 20 years or more because
it's the long lived assets
where it makes the most sense for
folks to participate.
The drawback of these P
three programs is there's not
really a model quote
unquote that's used. These
are all typically individually
negotiated, it makes
them very difficult to kind of
replicate the actual
documentation will vary
from transaction to transaction.
Um And so there isn't,
you know, it's not an easy thing to
make a program out of.
Um But with that, I would just
mention most P
three entities if they're coming
through, the financing's coming
through, the public entity
may have access to the P pr
F to ultimately fund
it. So
that's really what I wanted to talk about.
The P Pr being the
most likely
um vehicle
by which we would be able
to fund
um Some flexible
pro uh projects,
some innovative projects
uh for public
entities. And
with that, um I've
got Fernando here. Not
only because again, don't like sitting
up here by myself, but having
operated the most, probably
the most successful P three
program project in
New Mexico,
um He's got a lot of
experience in this area and a
lot of wisdom to share.
Um And I, I don't know
if you want to say anything before we turn
it over. But
um
>> well, good afternoon,
Mr chairman and committee
members, uh Thank
you for your time and the opportunity
to be here to talk about innovative
financing tools. And
as our CEO she
really covered it
very well. All, all the
innovative uh finance
tools that you've come
up with because I think this is the
first place where it needs to start
is with forward
thinking policymakers.
Um That, that's really where it
starts for establishing the
policies and the frameworks
and establishing the guidelines
that entities like
NM FA or NM
Rita can, can follow
and, and implement down the road.
But really what it boils
down to is is establishing
relationships
and um
across the state because
there's a multiple
landowners in this state,
everybody from the state Land
Office to the Bureau of Land
Management, USDA Forest
Service, there's Tribes
and Pueblos, there's private
lands. Um
There's all these entities
that, that you need to work with
and, and when you form public
private partnerships, that's
really, what it's about
is is establishing these
relationships across the
state and,
and more importantly how you're gonna
be vetting your development
partners. Um I think
that's a, that's a real key
piece of it. You know, you have to
make sure they have the financial
capability to do it, the
engineering experience, the
construction experience,
all those type of things so that
you're, you're, you're really
getting involved with, with the right
companies to make a difference.
And I think when you do that,
you can, you can make some big
things happen if you really want
to increase uh infrastructure
capacity across the state
and increase
um economic development
and economic diversity. It
really is through those relationships
and those partnerships, but it really
starts with the policymakers
and being forward thinking and
innovative. And
as Marquita
really listed out all
those programs that, that we
have available to us right
now if they're funded
properly, um we
can utilize them. I think
there's a, one of the reasons I
wanted to come to NM FA
was because it had a lot
of tools and an amazing
team led by with amazing
leadership that can make
big things happen across the state
and, and really work on
the infrastructure
capacity as as well as
economic development.
So um that's really
where it lies. But I think at the end
of it, you can make big things
happen. We, we have the largest
single phase wind farm in the
country, we have
the largest clean energy
infrastructure project in, in
the western hemisphere under
construction right now.
So those are the type of things that
can happen if, if, if you do
it properly.
And, and
uh NM fa I think is,
is the perfect entity
to, to really make a lot
of this happen
if there's enough funding to do
it. But I, I certainly think there's
a lot of uh policies
that are already in place
right now that that can be
utilized to
advance these
efforts a lot more than
what they're being. I
mean, nm fa has done a great
job over the years, expanded
in scope over the last
several years by
a significant amount.
And I think there's gonna be
uh even more growth from N
MA in in future
years as
well.
>> Thank you very much. Uh Representative
Chatfield. Thank you very much for the
presentation.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
I was tickled to
hear Marquita talk
once again about the fact that
agriculture doesn't get a lot
of these uh
innovative uh
type funding and especially
some of the things that would
transition us into a
less water intensive
form of agriculture.
There was a group of farmers in
Lamar Colorado
who raised corn,
uh water in that area
became less and less
and shorter and shorter as it
has across the west.
So they put
in a pellet mill
and the oil mill and
begin raising
sunflowers.
Uh The sunflowers produce
oil and the
byproduct's
pellets,
normal uh cake.
We call it in the business
pellets, whatever you want to call
it, the normal fat
contents about 7 to
8%. Sunflower
cake is about
12%
when they put that plant in
and, and nobody really knew
about that cake. I
used to bring it
in from Colorado and feed it to my
cattle. It was awesome.
People eventually found out
about it and
it should be cheaper
than normal cake. It got where it was
higher than normal cake. So I went back to
normal cake, but it is
a great
product. Uh
It, it
has a great
uh you know,
just uses less water,
it brings in money,
it gives everybody a job
and it has produces
sunflower oil, which is
people, food produces
uh pellets which
is cow food.
So the there was a
group of farmers in New Mexico
faced the same problem.
They began to do that. They
planted sunflowers, they
didn't have the, the
oil plant or the, you
know, it, it
extrudes the oil and produces
cake.
They did not have the plant. So
to get their sunflowers uh
marketed, they had to haul them
many miles and it was
not economically feasible.
So there is a
project that would be
feasible in New Mexico
that would use less
water,
uh,
produce a value-added
product.
Uh,
uh, so it,
it would be a win win situation.
There. There's a, a
project, I don't know which one
of these funds you could fund it out of,
but that's just the thought of a project
coming up.
Second. Uh,
thought
I'm looking at page
seven,
uh, 100 and 67,007,
184 New Mexico. Small
businesses with fewer
than 50 employees,
70% of the employer,
small businesses are fewer
than 1042
of them are
located in rural communities.
Now, we as a legislature
did something last year that
concerns me. We
passed the paid family
medical leave Act.
Uh, so it puts
more
pressure on these
small businesses,
uh,
to just
additional economic pressure.
If I have an employee that
employee takes off,
then I have
to give them a certain amount of
paid medical leave. Plus
I have to hire another
employee to come in
and do the job that I'm
already paying them to do. Right.
Really hard for a,
for a small business, maybe.
Uh, some governmental
entities, large
businesses can kind
of stand that kind of
financial
pressure. Most
of our smaller
businesses
cannot.
Do you see any less
interest? Do you see that
affecting the
applications,
uh, as far as small
businesses trying to get a
start and knowing that
they're gonna face this. And
I, I should
know, but I don't know how
many, how many employees
that kicks in. And if you don't, it's
just fine because I, I know
that's not what you do.
But
>> so Mr Chairman, I will
answer the second part first, which
is no, I don't have that data.
And the first part of the ques
question really gets
to the fact that we haven't
really started
using our federal dollars for
small business lending.
Remind you that about
97%
of our funding that goes through
the statewide Economic
Development Finance Act, which
is the thing John will talk about.
I'm I'm stealing all of this
lender. Um
97% of that
comes from federal
sources and so
uh or private sources,
so only, you
know, we, we don't really have state
money there. So we're waiting
for the Feds to approve
our application
to open up the
federal programs that the
rules that you applied at the that
you approved at the end of last
year. We're waiting for
them still to approve our application
to open those. So we don't
have any sense of where,
whether that law has
impacted any
business starts or anything. We
just have new
data.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and thank you for
your answer. You know, I don't know
what the result will be but it
concerns me uh
that it will uh
but we're trying really hard
on this fan to, to
develop small business
that on the other hand, we
do pass some laws that might
have a stifling effect. Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, representative, I will
now go to Representative Roybal
Caballero. >> Thank
you Mr Chair and thank
you again to both of you.
Excellent presentation.
So the thought occurred to me,
I, in previous
uh in my previous life,
I worked very heavily
with uh CD F
I um funds
financing and
organizations. And
so
having said
that I haven't um
ever asked you
or have I, I'm not
sure if I remember
whether two things,
whether N MA
is able to
access CD F
I directly
for funds. That's number
one. And then I'm
looking at their website
um just to refresh my
memory.
And throughout
the years through the, through
the, their inception
in the mid 19
nineties, they've
awarded um
billions of dollars
to a number
of, of entities,
one of which is
classified
as a community
development financial
institution
or institutional
programs seems
to me. And then I looked at NM
FA S um
beginnings
and the languages are
very similar.
And I'm wondering
if after you answered
number one question,
um it will be
based on this, whether
uh we would be better
served or
maybe not better served,
but we can
enhance
what we do
if we are
a community
development financial
institution.
Because then it goes back to my
previous comments
before this
presentation
about who
looking holistically
at development
or looking at development,
holistically
um so that
we can begin to make
stronger advances in our
state.
So
maybe
disjointed, maybe together,
I don't know however way you choose
to direct it. But
I don't think I've ever asked that
question in all my years that I've been
on this committee. But it
just suddenly occurred to me
that
this is another avenue
that we could sort of
comprehensively
pull
pool
our resources
in a way in which we can
then
um address what you
addressed in page
nine, which is
increasingly the smaller
average transaction
sizes by
the lending institutions.
And I heard this during the
public bank
debates
around public
banks that we're losing business.
Why, why do we want to have
another bank? But they
that lost the total
nature of what a public bank
is anyway. So,
but it goes to our
arguments about
how our
banks are
losing
in, in their
transaction sizes.
And so many
things can be very helpful in
addressing these
things that you've described
throughout the afternoon,
throughout the day. Actually,
however long you've been here with
us anyway,
that let's see how we can
go with that
multi pron questions.
Thank you,
>> Mr Chairman
Representative. So just to
back up a little bit, the CD
F I community develop
community development.
Financial institutions
Fund is a division
of the Federal Department of
Treasury and they
offer different programs
through that. One
of which is the New Markets Tax
credit program which
we participate in. We
have explicit authority
under the um statewide
Economic Development Finance Act
to create an entity
that can participate in
those. And we do so as
what they call ac DEA
community development
entity, we
cannot become
Finance. New Mexico
cannot become
a CD F I
that actual institution
um where that's
technically like a lender
where more than 50% of its
activities are directed
to um uh low
and moderate income
individuals or
communities. We
can't become that because it's a government
control because finance
authority ultimately
appoints the board and
oversees the operations
of Finance New
Mexico. It cannot
become a CD F I.
So you cannot have
government control and be
a CD F I at the same
time, if we were
to. And I think Senator,
then Senator Keller
actually introduced a bill
uh to, to turn
this uh finance New
Mexico into a CD F
I by explicitly
allowing for us to do that.
And it faced some concern.
I think there was some more
territorialism back in those
days. Um And there
was some concern from
other CFIS that we were gonna take
all the money. Um
So we did not go anywhere
um But it would have opened up the
opportunity for that
vehicle that we used
just for new markets, tax
credits to do more
broad-based lending across the
state right now. We can
only do them in very specific
instances in very specific
communities. So it's
not an opportunity for
us. Um So N
MA is not a CD F I,
it cannot, it cannot
be part of A CD
F I because of the
government control.
Um, there are
community development, financial
institutions in the state, some
very large ones
like Dream Spring,
the loan fund, West.
Home wise Lyft,
there's a lot of them, many credit
unions have established them
either for small business or
personal use, personal,
like residential or
um, um,
vehicle loans and things like
that. Um, but there
aren't as many in the
state as you would
think, given the
makeup and demographic of
the business population.
Um So my
point being that since they're such
so effective and we have
some that have great
capacity, um but
they are limited and ultimately the
amount of capital they can raise.
So that's the concept
here was to maybe use one
of our programs to
help get
what looks like equity into
those CD Fis and allow
them to access broader basis of
capital from already existing
sources of funding.
So it wouldn't be a significant
change. Um
But it could have significant
impact.
>> Thank you. >> So,
>> um,
well, there's many ways in which
we can release or
expand. We,
we need to be doing that the
access part of it,
but there's nothing
that prohibits us from
resurrecting.
Um
Then Senator
Keller's
legislation
on the other hand,
for what that intent and
purposes was,
and I think I was a new
freshman when
he introduced
that. And as a
new freshman legislator
in, from Albuquerque, I think he
invited me to see
if I could help
that with given my
background. So
I just wanted to, would
that be helpful
um in the
overall
transactions
um that you see
that we're undertaking as a
state? Uh Would
that be something that would be helpful?
From your perspective?
>> Uh Mr Chairman Representative,
I really have to think about that.
Um Many years ago when he
introduced that bill, we didn't do
much in the way of small
business lending and our world
has changed a little bit. So I'd
have to really look at what we
currently do and
whether it would be enhanced
by uh a community
development, financial institutions
fund or whether we'd
be better off deepening some of
the, the programs we already
have, putting more money in those pockets
and having greater impact. I, we
haven't really looked at that. I hadn't thought
about that. >> I, I
would encourage you to
think about it and look at it
only because the
federal government's
infrastructure
area of development
and focus for the future
of our economy nationally
as well as regionally and
then to help with the
States. Ultimately, that
was the objective.
Um I think
would be a good way
to see if
we can help small business
development in that area,
direct more directly. So
I would look at it from that
perspective
and then, um
because my teeth are chattering,
I'm freezing to death. I forgot
the second part of
my
um
other part of what I was going
to say, hold on a second.
Let me look at my
uh oh, and the
credit unions are
taking and playing a
larger role and,
and I'm encouraged
by that and I'm encouraging
them to continue to
do that because they are membership
driven and the fact
that you're membership driven,
you have much more
of a local
um
investment
and, but also
um a local
involvement in
that investment.
And so with
credit unions at that level
and the more the credit unions
are growing,
it seems to me that that would
be um something that would
be very helpful
um on a grander scale
as well. So, thank you and let's
let's let's bring
them into the conversations
um In all that we
do in terms of lending.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
>> Thank you, Representative. Very, very
good. Uh Representative
Serrato.
>> Thank you chairman. Thank you panelists uh
again for all your help.
Um I have a couple of questions and
one thing I wanted to mention was this
is uh I
it's a tough competition for which of
your slide packets like the best. But this
one is probably up there
because I mean,
being a member of the Economic Development
Committee in the House, a lot
of the data that you were able to provide in
here, um answers
a lot of questions that a lot of our committee
has and, and provides more.
Um So I may even should I be,
you know, go back to that committee next year.
Um I may even be asking if we
can have you all back there just
because for
a lot again, the data, but
also how we're looking
at uh you know,
utilizing the state to
encourage business. I mean, that's what we're all
about. Um I had a quick
question on your data um
on pay on slide seven
on this one and
then on slide four
of the Economic Development Revolving
Fund uh report.
It, it seems to be saying two slightly
different things and uh myself and my,
my colleague were trying to wrap our
heads around. We kind of got lost, I think in the
weeds. But it says here
that 76%
of employer small businesses have
fewer than 10 employees and account
for 47% of private
employment in New
Mexico.
But then it says here on, on
slide, 4 94%
of small businesses in New Mexico
have less
than 10 employees and meet the
federal definition of very
small businesses.
Why are those numbers different? Is
that I, I just don't, I
can't get my head around. Why? That's
different.
>> So you're asking me to do math
in front of people. Thank
>> you. Your slides made
me. Thank you.
>> So 100 and 60
almost 100 and 68,000
New Mexico small business with
fewer than 50 employees
onlys and 75%
of those don't have any
employees. So
25% of that
1, 68
has employees
and 76% of
those have fewer than
10. So I think
so. Um
and they represent 47%.
So it's, it's, it's a
cascade here. And
so >> I'm
sorry, chairman and, and Panelist.
So then on the next page
when it says 94% of small
business have less than 10,
that includes the ones that
don't have any employees. Correct?
Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you, Panas
that, that clarifies a lot. Thank
you. OK.
And then I also had a couple of other
questions in the
presentation, some of the
recommendations from the first group,
the, the CDFA A group.
Actually, this is slide six
talk about capital outlet.
And I, I'm confused
by this only because
capital outlay from my perspective is
always for,
it has nothing to, it has
nothing to do with small business in a sense,
right? It's because of the
anti donation clause. It's very
much funding. Uh There's
been really
um what's it called
shovel ready infrastructure
pieces. And I'm
curious, what
was their perspective or
your perspective, at least
how that impacts small
businesses. >> So, Mr
Chairman um community
development finance
also includes
infrastructure.
Um So when you consider
that most of capital
outlay goes to some sort of
infrastructure
that's where they get it. Um
So they, they looked at the
water, you know, so water
funding those grants
that you make or capital
outlay uh projects
that you make to small mutual
domestics, all count
in that big umbrella of
community development finance. So
infrastructure plays a major
role. Um And that's,
that's why they said that. >> Thank you,
Mr Chair. Thank you uh Panelist
for that. I I'm I would
love to dig into that deeper another day.
Um just one on one, even
partially because from
my experience, capital L A is fairly
consistent in my district at least,
and I imagine it may be in others as
well. Um Just because you, you just
have so many entities that are ready to
move forward. Um But, you know, I'm
happy to kind of understand that a little
deeper in what their perspective
was. Um The
other question I had was about those Aggie
bonds that you mentioned and a bit of what
Representative Chatfield was talking
about that really seem to be an
interesting um
like a like
a intersection between economic
development and agriculture,
right? Um There are some
parts of our state that isn't, that's entirely
lose their, their economy, right? How
the crops are doing, how the dairies
are doing that changes everything.
So I'm just kind of
curious how
one are the
federal dollars for
e bonds? Like,
do they increase if we
provide state funding as well as
a lot of times it does? And then
two has that been tried in the past
in the state and just been given up
or has it just never been
tried? >> Mr
Chairman Agie Bonds are
um uh Agie
funds come from
bonds that are issued that are tax
exempt. So they fall
under that very narrow
group of private
entities that can benefit from
tax exempt dollars.
So if you're going to have an Aggie
Bond and they're, they're very small
projects, they're very
specific um
kinds of projects that qualify,
uh you can have tax exempt bonds
issued on your behalf. It's
like a small manufacturing, you
can do up to $10 million
of tax exempt bonds
issued on your behalf. For
a qualified
manufacturing facility.
There are a number of exempt
facilities and private activity
bonds and this
is one of them. Um
So it's not actually dollars
but authority to issue
tax exempt debt
on their behalf. So that
would just lower the debt and
in large, in high interest rate
environments like today, that's
a big deal. Um
And so, but when, you
know, when we first got
the statewide Economic Development
Finance Act passed
the primary purpose of that
back in 2000, 2003
was to help provide a
statewide vehicle for that
tax exempt bond issuance
because right now you kind of have to go
to the local community, some
of whom have really good
well-established programs
and others who don't have the staff really
to pull that off. Um or
you might have multijurisdictional
projects. So that's what
Sweda was intended
to be, was a statewide issuer
of these kinds of bonds.
Um I would note that last
month or actually, frankly, last
week at our board
meeting, we actually
took the first
step in issuing a private
activity bond, an exempt
facility bond. Uh 20
years after Swed got passed.
20 years later, we finally
did the first
inducement resolution for
an exempt facility down
in um, uh
Lee and Eddie
County for
a project down there.
Um But that was
the first time. So that's what an
Aggie Bond is. Uh what
I would suggest is that that is also
a valuable tool. But it,
because the federal,
federal government limits the amount
of these private activity bonds that can
happen and other
things like
housing bonds
use that same activity. That's
virtually all that
the volume cap goes
to in the state,
maybe the better tool would
be to provide
very
bespoke
tools to hit that target
that Representative Chapel
talked about. Um, because I
don't think Aggie bonds are flexible
enough for those sorts of things and they're
high compliance. So unless
you're going to be issuing a lot of
them, it's not very
efficient, you can't make it easy
for the client ultimately,
if there's just one or two of
them. So if you have a lot of
volume like in Illinois
or Iowa,
um then you can make it a
program that's easy for the client
to utilize. If there's
not very many of them, it's very hard
to do that. So for
projects like that, if you,
if you can't make it easy, it's, it's
really almost unfair to
offer it, but you
can come up with
tools either through
Sweda. Um because,
you know, we can lend directly in those
kinds of, of tools or through the
venture capital program,
we could do value
a out value-added
ag or some
other kind of program
that might help take
out the risk of
switching crops
or changing
irrigation systems. Or,
you know, there's a lot of risk
involved in that. Um
Because
you all know better than I
farming is an art, more
than a science, it's definitely not a
science element to it, but you've got to know
your land, you've got to know
and sometimes when you change
up what you've known, it
can be very costly.
Um So
tools like that
where you take where you're, you know,
taking some of the risk out
where it's not really appropriate for a
bank to go in and kind
of bet on that.
Um There's a public purpose
that's involved in reducing
the amount of water that
we might want to take a on
that concept, you lean into
the risk that exists there for the
public benefit of maybe
reducing the water usage
or increasing the value
of the crop um as a
result. So I
think that that that would be a better
way to hit some of those,
those targets. >> Thank you,
Mr Chair. Thank you, Panelist. I, I
appreciate that. I have written
down value
a a, you know, our, our
VC funds, you know. So
that's fascinating. I appreciate you kind
of digging into that a little bit more.
Um Last question I have
was a lot of the recommendations
also seem to
indicate
funding for
acquiring space or
land, however you want to
place to place to build.
Um Unfortunately, and we were talking about
this earlier, a lot of times we
run into the zoning issue or
just that, you know, you have this great
idea, you have everything except for the
space. And I'm curious
and I, and it seems to me that a lot
of what NM FA is
resolving doesn't
necessarily touch that, that, that,
that act, that zoning
I'll say issue overall,
but really how to maximize what we already
have. Um Is
that correct? And do you have any thoughts on
kind of addressing the full
spectrum? And you feel like that's beyond
here? >> Um I
have a couple of thoughts. Uh
I'm not sure I'm addressing
it entirely
but House Bill 195
as you know, um
really got one thing right,
which was the direction
uh in statute to
have the board prioritize
projects that implemented
those land use best
practice land use.
Um A lot of it doesn't
get to a
change necessarily,
but transparency
around processes that they have
existing. So you'll
know when you look at the policies
and there's just like three pages
of best practices that you
can have. It doesn't
say respond within seven
days, it says publish
a timeline for
how quickly you'll respond because
it's the unknown that
costs you money. If
you can plan around it,
then you, you know, you know, you
know what you're getting into as a developer,
as you know, as a contractor,
you know, what the time frames are.
So many of them don't have
a public, you know, they don't have it
promulgated, they don't have it
posted. So even
best use, best practices
of just publishing, what you already
do is a huge
step forward for many of these
projects. Um
And then as you know, more
starts to get developed, you know, as
you start to think about it, it's amazing
when you write something you go,
that's not very efficient and
then you start to make some improvements,
I hope would be that they would,
you know, even just writing
down what they currently do
would start to make them think
differently. Um But I'm a
huge advocate for
incentivizing change
as opposed to forcing change.
And I think that this could be a really
good tool. Again,
ultimately, we have to work through some
of the mechanisms, but I think House
Bill 195. Got that part.
Really? Right.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you. Panelist, I have
to run but I appreciate all your answers to the
questions. Thank you.
Ok. Thank you very much. >> Representative
Senator Briggs.
Thank you, Mr Chair and I'll do my
best to be brief.
The uh the
Council of Development
Finance Agencies
targeted
capital L A as,
as being something that we
need to, we need to change.
And Mr Chair and
members capital L A is about
5% or so of the state's
budget.
So it's a,
it's kind of low hanging
fruit. It's an easy thing to
attack. But
the uh uh the
uses for capital
outlay, especially
statewide
is, is extremely
important for
communities like mine
and, uh, and
representative Chatfield
and, and even Senator
Padilla. Uh,
so I think if we want to
look at capital
outlay, what we,
what we ought to do is maybe
look at restricting
its usage tighter
but not so much of
eliminating capital outlay.
It's just too important
across the state. And I believe
that's something that, that as
you guys look at you have
pressure.
Uh I know
Senator Rodriguez would hate
to see something really
happen to Capital L
A. But,
um with,
with that, that was
on, that was on page six
and I want, wanna tag on a little
bit with the
representative Chatfield
on page seven,
which is
the,
the small business
numbers and, and
stuff. And
we talked about this
in the in the Economic Development
Committee because
what we're doing is we're pushing
hard, we're working hard
to try to develop
opportunities for small
business, for
business to come
to our state. And
I think if
you all consider again,
which I believe you will,
the paid family and medical
leave Act, you need
to look at these numbers right
here on page
seven and you
look at what
impact
that particular act
could have
on these
numbers right here
and what the impact it might
have on bringing
business to New
Mexico. Ask
the sponsors tough
questions about
these points
have they addressed?
Have they talked
to numerous
businesses shown
on this page?
What impact do they think
they see?
Because that particular
act or that particular
bill, that proposal
has a lot of moving parts
which are
I believe
dangerous to these
businesses. That
mean I'm right. But
that's what, what I believe.
And I think it's just important
for those questions to
be asked and I
encourage all of you
here to,
to do that, to make sure if
that, if that bill
passes it
passes in the best
possible manner.
One last thing, Mr
Mr Chair, and I think
it's just something to that
is different than
we've talked about. And Marquita,
it may not be
something that even applies
to MNM
FA.
But you've seen,
if you've been watching
TV, if
you've been listening to the news,
you've seen the fires in Red
Ocean.
What is happening right
now? And what's gonna happen
statewide in
New Mexico
communities like mine in
Alamogordo,
people who are having
their home, homeowners
insurance
canceled
or not being able
to renew it
because of
wildfire.
We need to look at some
manner, some mechanism.
Uh, there's already a New
Mexico Fair
plan for
insurance. But
how could
the state of New Mexico
even through NM
FA, uh,
develop plans to
be able to
offer,
uh,
wildfire insurance,
flood insurance
to keep the state
or keep these insurance
companies from
canceling
policies on, on
individuals? Because I'll bet
you if they're doing it
in Alamogordo
today, which they
are,
how many of these people
up in Red
Osa will be
able to get
homeowners insurance
once all of
this has blown
over
and then,
and then how
many people are gonna have
issues with their mortgage
company because
every mortgage company
requires homeowners
insurance. So
what's gonna happen with all
that? So I think it's
important as,
as you guys discuss
things and as you see things
either using it through
here or
somewhere else,
uh,
consider how can we deal
with, with insurance?
Is there, is there way? And
I wanna, I wanna pass one other
thing on along again
as gonna go
back to capital Outlay
somewhere.
And I want, I want to talk about
all these other companies or all these
other places that say
what ought to work.
Governor Lou Wallace
way back in the 18
sixties said
one particular thing which
I always remember and I'm gonna
paraphrase it because I don't
remember it specifically.
He says things
that work
elsewhere
fail miserably
in New Mexico.
So when they try to push
other proposals
to us, remember
that I'm glad to see
that Senator Padilla.
So thank you, Mr Chair and
thank you >> and
Mr Chairman, if I could just,
and again, it was
CDFA A's recommendation. I want,
I want to be really clear. I had nothing to do
with it. But I will say that
their perspective is borne
by the fact that if you go to
other state programs,
many states have grants
for clean energy,
for water for, you
know, there's a number of large
state grant programs
and New Mexico doesn't
have a lot of programs
for local governments because
instead they go to capital
outlay. And so from their
perspective. The
concept was you would get more
targeted return
if you had grant programs
for explicit, you know,
maybe you have a grant program
for broadband, you have a grant program
for clean energy projects,
whatever it is you're trying to achieve,
that's what they were taking it
from. So their perspective is really
borne by many other
states have a lot of grant
programs. And New
Mexico simply doesn't,
you don't apply to a grant program
to get a project funded
and you're not, and you're
not necessarily looking for a
specific kind of return
for that investment. So I think
that's just,
you know, academically, that's
what they were looking at and, and
that's what they were commenting on.
There are very few other
states that do it the way we do
it, not saying it's not successful,
saying from their perspective,
it's unusual,
>> Mr Chair Marquita. Thank you very
much. That just means that we're just
better.
>> Thank you very much,
Senator. >> We
all understand that,
but we can also put
more money in water trh
board. We can put more
money in certain things
that allow some of that
even if that means reducing
the dollar amount, that
capital.
>> Thank you very much, Senator. And
what famous book did,
uh former Governor Lou
Wallace, write
Ben Hur and by the way,
Senator, you're, you're not getting off
the hook till December 31st.
So, you know, quit telling we're gonna do
all this. Um, All right,
Representative
Toras,
>> thank you, Mr Chair.
Um I'm glad
Senator Griggs brought up
uh the
point of insurance cause I think
that's a very, very
big problem for New
Mexico. Uh
not only for existing
homeowners but for new
projects that are being built.
Um We're seeing uh
projects that are being
built, go through the
design phase or whatever
uh and through the
uh finance financial
phase and then
come to find out that they're
in a fire zone and
can't get insurance.
We're having
um insurance
companies pull out of New
Mexico or, or
refusing to do
business in New Mexico,
just like we have flood zones, we
have fire zones that they've
created, right, wildfire
zones or whatever you want to call it.
And so that's
creating a
problem.
Uh not only
for existing homeowners
and stuff and I, I think he's
dead on
when he says that it's going to
cause a problem. And
I think I see Mr
Chair, I see a problem
with some of these,
not just homeowners, but
these multi uh
family dwelling units
or these, you
know, these apartment complexes,
these other projects that are all
of a sudden coming
to, uh you know, to
surface on these projects
where they can't get
the insurance I need or
it's, or it's extremely
expensive. And
so I, I think that's a big problem and
I'm glad he highlighted that.
Um I'm gonna stick
to Mr Chair, um the
innovative Financial tools
that we were looking at
presentation and
I'm gonna start with page
two. I just want
to kind of quickly go through
this. Um,
one of the things that excuse
me, page three, excuse me
on that. Um,
and that report,
you know, I was, I was looking and just,
this is just kind of my background.
I'm just looking and I'm, and I'm,
I, I see
that over a
third
of the changes here
or new, whether you
want to call them funds, grants
programs
are since
2021.
So my question would be Mr
Chair of these
new products, which are I, I
would say close to 40%
of the new funds.
How does that reflect
in your
total
uh your total
size of your, of
of NM fa
what does that account for in dollars?
I mean, in other words, if it's a million dollars,
let's just say the total, your total
budget or your total
dollars that you're that
you're working
with is a million.
How much of those? And I don't
mean to break it down. I'm just using this
as an example
of the total dollars
that you're working with.
How many of those account
for. And I'm wondering
if the last
40% of
uh of these new funds
that you have that have
been passed in the last three
years account for
more than what was the
previous? Because there hadn't been any
changes for 10 years.
And then before that, since
1992 you, you've got
some years there that you know, other
funds. So how much did you grow?
I guess in total,
in, in, in your,
in your entity.
>> So Mr Chairman, I would note
that the public project revolving
fund, the drinking water state
revolving fund.
Um, the water project fund
and the child care, I'm sorry, the,
um, Colonia
Infrastructure Fund, all
which were created prior to
2011,
they represent as a
block, the largest activity
of the finance authority. So
the pr F funds 200
million generally a
year. Water Trust board
has because it's a percentage
of severance tax bonds
and that dollars have been quite
large. Those have grown.
Uh, the, the drinking
water program um
is a large portion of
activity each year
and um at
least the drinking water and P pr
offer all loans. And so that
activity stays on our books for
quite some time versus
like the Water Trust Board, which is
mostly grant.
So it's still a
significant portion
of activity and
is the, the program
growth, um explains
why we went from 39
employees uh
roughly in
2021.
Uh when we
approved the um
budget
for fiscal
year
2020
uh we were budgeted for 44
FTEs. Our
budgeted FTEs
for fiscal year
25
is 77.
Our budget is generally
tripled um
because of the kinds. It's
not only that we are doing
more of the same like with water
trust board and P pr F, but we're
doing different things
and they're fairly
new to the Finance authority, the venture
capital program, opportunity,
enterprise, all the
recovery programs
required a significant
amount of new
technology um
that we're frankly leveraging
to the benefit of all the other
programs. So it's not like it
was not invested well,
because it wasn't, you know, use
it once and we're done.
We've managed to take that
technology, move it over to
other parts of our agency,
increase the efficiency, which
allows us to do some
of the other things. So it's
ultimately been quite beneficial.
One part has really helped
the other. Um, but
I, I would say, you know, we've
basically tripled
>> and, and that's, I, I
was just talking to
Representative Sra
Serato and I said,
I bet you they're almost
triple the size. And that's because
that's a, that's a lot of work that,
that has increased. And so
on the side of caution, Mr
Chair, um I'm not
trying to, you
know, make it
rain in here, you know, but I'm
trying to or put a dark
cloud over us. I just want
to be on the side of caution
because that's just the way I'm
programmed, uh to
just say, you know, we've grown
quite a bit in the last, you
know, three years and
we, we, we wonder
sometimes we see that
it takes a minute for it
to implement
itself by the time you, you know,
you pass it, implement
it and see the results.
Um and,
and that
putting that in your, in,
in the question, do you
have any
reservations
over the
possibility of us
as a nation going into
recession? And how would that
affect us?
>> Um Mr Chairman,
um so I appreciate
the dark cloud honestly. Um
as well as, you know, as an
analyst and, you know,
um I would
just, um
so I don't have as many concerns
about the recession because that's
typically when you need the kinds of
funding that we provide, being a gap
lender, that's when
our, our capital is needed the
most. Um
And so that, you know, in
terms of our activity
are we tend to be needed more in
those, in those economic
times.
Um
I would say the benefit of the
last couple of years of
growth have been that we've
deepened or
expanded the programs that already
exist because you're exactly
right. It takes a long
time for new
programs to take hold, particularly
if they have their own board
opportunity. Enterprise is now
just really hitting its
stride after two
years. It takes a while,
particularly in new program
areas um to,
to kind of get a sense of
what it is you're trying to achieve with
the dollars, you know, it goes,
you know, it just takes a while
um takes a while to establish
policies and protocols.
Um And so I was pleased
that when the housing effort
was presented to us,
that it was an expansion of something
that already existed. And
it allowed us to get a significant
jumpstart on the
implementation of that program
by just adding a fund to an
existing tool
rather and creating
a new tool whole Cloth
because that is
very difficult.
Um We, we administer
a four boards,
um, a statewide dr
task force, the Finance
New Mexico Advisory Board,
our board administration team
is its own animal
because we just do so much
activity and in
administering
to auxiliary boards.
So in the dark cloud
realm, I'd really prefer
deepening
existing programs if we're
trying to hit new targets rather
than creating whole cloth for the reasons.
you just described new
whole cloth means
more, it, it just costs
us more to operate those programs
and we don't get more benefit for the
dollar. >> And
that's no, and that's, that's
again, it's just
we have to think of that the other
side, right. Just, I
mean, because
the idea Mr
Chair is for
this, for
New Mexico Finance Authority to
continue
to serve the, the
people of New Mexico.
And we definitely don't want to
see. I mean, it, and it can hurt
anybody. I don't care how much you prepare. It
can, it can affect us.
But I think
on, on, although
you, you're correct
that those are when we need
things the most. At
the same time, some of these programs
are funded by
them being paid back.
Right. So sometimes
when we loosen the rules a little
bit too much, it can come back,
but we're not getting a, our,
our, our funds back
and then possibly
crippling um
your ability to, to
help the next person.
And that's just, it's just, I thought I
just put that out there just
because I just kind of see
the, the, the environment
that we're in today. And
I personally, I mean, I'm, I'm
not talking for just NM
fa I'm talking about for myself.
I'm being more cautious at what
I'm, what I'm personally doing with,
with my stuff. Uh
And, and so I bring
that up now
the,
the next question I'll just get
off, that was
on page
eight.
Let me find it
here.
Shero.
OK. Yeah. And you mentioned this
and this is my last question because
I really want to
let someone else ask
questions, the,
the,
the question that I had on
that
and I want to ask you instead of me
feeding this uh Mr
Chair
um Marquita
is
when you say that I
read here that
54%
lending has, is down, let's
see here.
We're 54 54%
below what they were in
2007. What do
you, what do you this five, half
a half a $500
million less business funding
provided by statewide annually.
What do you attribute that to?
Because I think I have, I think
I know, but I'd rather hear it from
you, >> Mr
Chairman. I would say that I
think the first is just
regulations on the banks.
It's harder to be a bank now than
it was in 2007. That's
pre you know,
recession that
was a major hit and
the credit tightening
started then. And
so I would say that was first and
foremost, it's harder to be a
bank now than it was in
2007. >> That's
exactly right. I think
Mr Chair,
I think Dodd Frank had a lot to
do with that. The over
tightening of lending
and the
uh cash flow
requirements
and the penalizing of
banking for helping
even those,
those uh
um
partnerships. I'm gonna call them partnerships
because when you lend it to someone that's a
partnership uh that you're
investing in um
e even if they were long term
partners, OK.
Uh loans that you
had and they ran
into a little dip
in, in uh
in cash flow
banks were penalized
if they help them. And
so I don't, I, I want
this, I, I wanted the, the
um I
wanted our colleagues
to know that that's
the reason it's not so much
that they purposely, they,
the banks decided not
to lend. It was more that they
had their hands tied
and were unable to, to lend
under uh the real a lot
I think overregulated my,
my opinion. Ok.
That's my personal opinion,
but that's all I have Mister Chair.
Thank you. >> OK.
Thank you very much. Uh Representative
Vice Chair of
Representative Garrett.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you both. Um
I now know a lot more about community
development, financial institutions
because I've been sitting here researching
it and the Castaneda
Hotel in
Las Vegas brought
$8.5 million
from a national.
So who knew
>> through a new markets tax credit
project?
>> Um So thank you for
introducing all of us to
new acronyms
and concepts.
And let's see. So my question
is actually Fernando,
can you just briefly
describe the public
private partnership
process in?
I'm trying not
to use acronyms
uh the Renewable
Energy Transmission
Authority. Rita,
can you just real
quick? So
we can cause many of
us here are very interested in P
threes,
>> Mr Chairman, vice Chair
Garrett. Um That, that's a really
good question. I'll try not to get
too in depth to it because I know you do
have the renewable Energy
Transmission Authority coming tomorrow
that can provide a lot more
detail. Um But
essentially, it's what I I mentioned
a while
ago is just, it's, it's
really,
you're, you're gonna
get some of your
um assets that you,
you have as a public entity
and you're, you're gonna share them
the risks and the rewards
with a private entity.
Um The way it worked in Rita
was that normally
they would provide the, the
financing for a
project and
then Rita would provide
a lot of like the ability
to get through the regulatory
process and help them get the
permissions, which would be the most
difficult piece of
development these days, I think
that's really the hard part is
is getting permission to build your
project. So
what we were real careful about
in that situation
was making sure
that they had the financial
capability that had a
great reputation for
doing things the right way so
that they were gonna be following
all environmental regulations
at the state, federal and local
levels. Um,
that sort of thing, they had the
construction experience, the
engineering experience
and then what we would bring to the
table is just
expertise with how things
get done in New Mexico. Because
I mean, that quote that
Senator Griggs came up
with is exactly right. Things
that work elsewhere don't necessarily
work in New Mexico.
And so knowing that lay of the
land where you have your tribes,
you have your military installations,
you have your labs, you have your
research universities, you
have various
landowners and, and
environmental groups and
others. You need to learn to work
with all those groups of
people and all those stakeholders
that really advanced a project
um in the state.
So, so the public private
partnership in that case
is, is really about
vetting the, the
your development partners
very carefully. And then
it's about understanding
what, what you can bring as an
entity to help them
through the process. And in that
case, in Rita's case, is
really about bringing
um that expertise in getting
the permissions. Plus there's
tax incentives, you know,
property compensating
groce receipt tax,
there's Eminent Domain
Authority, um there's ability
to issue and sell bonds. There's,
there's all those kind of things that, that
you can do so that that's
essentially it, but you can
apply sort of that model
which is actually being replicated
in other states, you know, like
Colorado and in
nationwide, there is a lot
of questions for how they, they
could do it in their states as well
because it is a successful model
for really bringing
in billions of dollars
of capital investment into
New Mexico that results in
thousands of jobs. And
um not to
mention a better
infrastructure so that you're able
to have more reliable,
resilient power in the
state, which makes you more competitive
because now you have
that sort of power and it's
affordable. Um So
there's a lot of benefits from it
um that you can see and I think
a lot of those lessons can
be applied here
NM FA as well and in
forming those same type of
partnerships um
and to build up the infrastructure
and increase economic
development and, and diversity
as well.
>> Thank you. And then my other
comment, Mr Chair is that some of
us are looking at the
capital outlay
process. We're starting with
just transparency
on the existing
system. But
has NM fa have you ever
sat down and
written
recommendations
based on
the work that NM does
like do have a list someplace
we'd like to see this, this and
this
>> um Mr Chairman,
madam Vice chair.
No,
we've stayed out of capital outlay.
Um I don't think we could add a lot of
value to it. Honestly,
we do the water trust board
again for a very specific purpose
and colonia for very
specific purpose,
but it's hard to deliver.
Uh grant dollars are
very difficult to deliver.
So I don't have much other
than um best
of luck.
>> Thank
you.
>> Ok. Thank you very much.
Uh madam vice chair and
uh presenters um have
worked with a lot of these people for so long
that they asked a lot of my questions.
So I'll be very, very
succinct if you go to page
13 bullet number
three,
you had to know I was gonna ask a question about
this one, Marquita. We've been talking about this
for several months. Now, I
appreciate you bringing this
information in. I think this is very
interesting. Um
Did I hear you say correctly that
this is already permissible
under New Mexico
Law?
>> Mr Chairman, if I said that
I was in error, I think it
would need some adjustments
for us to act as
a, as
a, as the tenant, as
the lessie
subor
less
or it
would need some mechanism
to get us there
if we were to do a
guarantee,
that's the part that we, we
may have the ability to do. We're
looking at that that will come
up in August for sure.
When we bring you rules because
currently the rules provide
that we can um
guarantee a
loan and this
would in fact, just be guaranteeing
an obligation that isn't a
loan, a commitment to
meet um, a lease
payment, for instance. So we're
looking at that still.
Um It was a harder question
than I thought it was. Uh
but we are still looking at
why that provision
exists in law. We think it came
from uh the
Metropolitan Court
bonds. Uh because
we in fact used the,
the, we issued
those bonds and gave
bondholders a lien on the
P pr F when we did that back
in, I don't 1999 or
2000
lots long time ago.
Um So we think that's what that goes to and
we don't know how, how transferable
that authority is.
>> And so is that something you can do
in rule or does that, is it in law
that you need to
legislation >> Mr
Chairman? It's already in rule
and we did it once. So I'm
really hoping it was in law, you
know, 25 years ago, but
that's what we're trying to figure out is
kind of when I asked
our general counsel. He went.
Oh,
I've been there the whole time.
Um So we are
really trying to uncover
what, what the basis
for that in rule is and
why and how,
how broadly it can be
applied >> and, and
to your knowledge at the moment,
is there like a size on something
like this and is,
is our,
is debt service, something
that's allowable under what you just
described, >> Mr Chairman,
we would be making up a new program
in that instance, not, not
in the sense that it would be a new
structure. Um We'd be
using the PR F in that
structure to make a
guarantee for
a lease payment and
it would be for the entire, I
would think it would be for the
entire term. If you
know, if someone missed five
payments, we would be
guaranteeing all five of those
years, that would be the max
amount that we would
deliver. So I, I think
it would be um
based on that
formula >> and
then just the last question I had,
then I'll lease
back securities as you have
it outlined
here. And what we just discussed,
is there any state or
is there originating,
is there any state
outlay of any
kind when something an
agreement like this is entered
into?
>> No Mr Chairman, not that I know. I
mean, there's again,
depending on how
you,
how you see the P Pr F's
role.
We certainly would prefer a guarantee
model overall being
in the actual lease chain
because it's much closer to what
we currently do and it would be
a much easier thing for us to monitor
and oversee. So that
would be our preference.
Um in, in these
kinds of
scenarios, >> then
if that's where you got the backing
from, would
you, would you
have to pick up and kind of put
that those dollars
in a holding pattern
as the guarantee or
would you still be
able to utilize them with a rate of
return all the other things you do
with those funds? >> Mr Chairman,
it would really depend on the way in which
we ultimately structured
it. Um
The way the P Pr F
works is
that the governmental
gross receipts tax comes over
once a month and it sits
in a, in an account that's
um there for
bondholders and
debt service comes over
from our clients either monthly,
semi annually or
annually. And it sits in that same
thing. Once bondholders
are paid money
becomes available for us
to make new loans or do
something else with, we would
reserve it uh
for, you know, a period
of time and if it's needed that
year, if it's not needed, it
would, it would go through
our system. Um So
I think we have enough liquidity that
it's not an actual issue.
It would be a short term issue
for cash flow purposes,
but it would ultimately depend on the the
structure. >> Sure. Sure.
Wonderful. Well, thank you very much
for this innovative
financing tools,
really workshop and education
session. I thought that was very, very good. Thank
you very much.
Ok, everyone on the
committee, we are going to go to
our last presentation of the day.
So I'll draw your attention to item number
six, which was
intended for 3 p.m. It's
3:42 p.m.
now.
Ok. So,
uh and we kept the best for last
today because we wanted everyone to
stay. I
mean, boy, are they
in a great mood?
Uh Mr Brooks John Brooks,
chief of Programs for New Mexico
Finance Authority. And thank you
Marquita and the rest of your team for being
here today. Um We'll
let you take it away.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman and committee
members. You know, I have
the, the, the great
task of following the
star of the show.
Marquita and Fernando
and then try to get you out
before uh
530.
So we'll see what we could
do 615.
Yeah.
So today, this
is um part of our biannual
update on the Economic
Development revolving fund
and I'm gonna cover a couple of things
uh the SS BC I
2.0
the redistribution
of those funds and then
a update on the
program funds within
the Economic Development
revolving fund
on, on page
two under
the Statewide Economic Development
Finance Act. Uh
There was uh
the Economic Development
revolving fund was created
in, in for the purpose of
stimulated the economy
in New Mexico and especially
underserved areas.
And as part of
that particular legislation,
uh the legislators
um uh require
that we have two reports
to the Oversight Committee
um in lieu of
having a um
authorization list.
And so this is the first
report for
2024
in regards to that
uh that, that
change that we made in on
the, we
a on
page three
a little bit about the small business
credit initiative and why
it's important. Uh
The, this SS
BC I um
2.0
was um
recreated or
reauthorized under the
American rescue
plan. And under that
particular legislation,
it provided $10
billion of, of funds
to support small
business financing programs
and entrepreneur uh
entrepreneurship
as a focus on socially,
economic divi disadvantaged
individuals and
also small businesses.
It defined uh
how uh treasury
is going to look at what they call
setti businesses
which are um
as the economic
disadvantaged individuals and
small businesses which
are defined with
businesses fewer than 10
employees.
And fall
2022
uh New Mexico was
rewarded um
$74.5
million of funds that
will be distributed in
in three tranches of
$22 million.
The application that was
made to um
treasury on behalf
of the economic uh
behalf of the state was
through the Economic Development
Department
and through their
application, they outlined
two specific programs,
$9 million for their
collateral support program,
which is operated
under the name of
Collateral Assistance
program. And then
also they created the New
Mexico Growth Fund, which
is a equity and venture
capital funds.
So in, in
our operating uh
those two particular
programs. Uh
The Economic Development Department
reached out to NM FA
to enter into AM
ou to look
at uh the
reallocation of
$50 million
of money into
the VC to
uh in VC,
money to debt
programs.
And so on page
four that um
began the nexus
of how the finance
authority got involved
in in
the redevelopment
of the, the programs.
And the first step
was NM fa worked
with the next street
uh to perform a
small business capital
landscape research
which Marquita outlined
in in her presentation
today. It also
informed NM fa how
to operate the vis uh
venture capital program
and also the, the
funding and how it could be best
utilized in the state of New
Mexico.
Uh The,
the, the components
that came out of those uh
that landscape that
was done first,
uh They identified there
was about 100 and 68
small businesses with less than
50 employees in
New Mexico.
75% of the
New Mexico small businesses
don't have uh
do not have paid
employees.
And then also they identify
94% of small
businesses in New Mexico
have uh
um greater than
10 employees that meet the
federal defini or smaller,
less than 10 employees
that meet the uh definition
of very small business.
And then 42%
of the employer, small
businesses are
located in rural
communities. And
then lastly, the
uh the research also showed
that minority owned
businesses are significantly
underrepresented in
small business ownership
in, in the state of New Mexico.
And so with those uh
elements in mind
and some of the findings that
came in place,
uh the Finance Authority,
along with the Economic
Development Department came up
with the idea of redistributing
the funds into uh
different uh
funds that are offered
through the SS BC
I that could fit
into the Economic Development
revolving fund and
then have a greater impact
on the state in terms of
the allocation of
funds. And so
on page five,
is the summary of the
modification request that
we worked with the
Economic Development Department
in terms of allocating
the funds. So
in the first column that you'll
see under the
uh all the Allocca original
allocation,
the Economic Development
Department allocated
65 million into
uh the venture capital
program and then
9 million under the
collateral support
program
based on the
research and, and
working with
the um
uh the Economic Development
Department, the Finance Authority
uh made a
recommendation
and, and, and
proposed a new
redistrict
redistribution of
funds. So we
would take $42 million
out of the venture capital
um um fund
and move to a
10 additional
million dollars to the
collateral assistance
program. Uh move
$27 million into
the loan participation
program and then
put $5 million into
the capital access program,
which is the loan
loss guarantee
insurance pool that would
be uh created.
And so as a result,
the proposed allocation
that we submitted to treasury
are in is in
column number three which
um uh which
aligns and addresses some
of the issues that was done.
Uh That was a um
brought out in the
research. So
we still have funds that
are allocated to the venture
capital program to deal
with the uh early
stage um
um growth, uh early
stage growth. Um
um companies,
then we have
the collateral access program
that provides an additional
collateral to businesses
that are, that do not have
the adequate collateral that are
necessary to take on a
loan. And
then in terms
of the loan
participation program
where uh where banks
are willing to lend, but they don't
have uh
the the
the necessary risk
um uh
mitigate,
they will
um enjoy that
type of risk
mitigation with the
loan participation
program. With us
being in at a
either a perry pau
or subordinated
position so that minimizes
the risk and allow them to
take on loans.
Also with our participation,
what we have seen in the past
is a buy down of interest
rates. So the interest rates for
businesses and
um and
uh uh
rich interest rates on
loans have been reduced
and that's allowed the, the
companies to debt service.
And we've seen a lot of
success with that particular
program. And then finally,
we allocated 5 million
to a new program which
is a the loan loss reserve
program. We
originally, the attempt
was to have more money put
in that program. But as
the interest rates
increased in
uh throughout uh
especially the,
the, the, the
Wall Street Journal prime rate
and where a lot of banks are based
in their base rates.
We we
saw that there was a less interest
in that particular program. So we
moved out reallocate
those funds into the
loan participation
program
on page
six.
Um this
is how,
how the economic
development revolving fund is
broken in up to,
it is broken up into
five subco
subaccounts.
The first one is the
smart money, which is a state
funded loan participation
program. Currently,
there is um a little
bit of money of approximately
$1.2
million remaining in that particular
fund. The
second um
program, the Collateral
Support Participation
program, which is funded
from uh basically
from federal funds from
the first tache of Small
Business Credit initiative
and then also from
2.0
we are uh
if we have
the application into
Treasury and if with
the approval of treasury,
we will add $27
million into that
particular program.
And then uh fund
three, the capital access
program which will be
funded with the new uh
capitalization from
the modification request
of $5 million.
The essential services working
capital program is a, a
direct uh working capital
program that was used
during COVID. It was
essent uh made loans
made to essential service
providers during the the
pandemic. And
that program essentially has
been shut down because
we're uh past that
particular period.
Um And then finally,
the cannabis uh microbus
program is a start up
capital to license
um cannabis
microbusinesses. We
took the funds from the
essential, the remaining funds from
the essential services to fund
that particular program.
And now we have
wind down that
program as well.
So on starting on
page seven are the
results of each
one of those particular
programs except for
the capital access
program.
Um On page seven,
the smart money loan participation
program is
basically um
a loan participation where
we will lend right next
to the banks and credit
unions and hopefully uh
reducing the borrowing
costs and sharing the
risk. Our interest
rates are based off the treasury
plus um risk
adjustments that are typically
between 1.5
to 2% and
the loan amounts is maximum
is $2 million up
to 49% of the
total financing.
And as you can see, we
have um
made uh seven loans
from this program
which created a
net of 237
jobs. Uh We
currently have a out stand loan
balance of $1.7
million. NM
FA S average
participation in
our loans is about
32% and
we have dedicated over the
time of $7.6
million and the
total which matched
up and leveraged $32
million of bank
financing
on page
eight,
the,
the first tranche
of SS BC I
Funds, uh
which was
originally about
$13 million
of which $8
million were um dedicated
to the loan participation.
And the rest went to
uh the Economic Development
Department for their
first capital, their
venture capital program
and then the rest to fund
uh their capital
access program
in which you'll see.
Um uh there
were 215
jobs that were created as a
result of this financing
that came from the
first round of uh
the S BC I in
2010.
And as you can see,
there is no more loan
balances out
outstanding because all
the loans have been paid
as agreed and paid in
full. We had our
last payoff from
the, the loan from
MW Holden in Santa
Fe, which is uh a
distribution
company. Well,
the real estate holding
company for a bicycle
technology, which is a
big uh distribution
uh center in Santa
Fe. Um As
you can see, we lent
out a pro
$8.3
million which leveraged
$34 million
of bank financing
over that time
frame.
And then lastly
on page
nine, this
essential services
was uh designed
for bridge capital.
Uh We provided working
capital loans or direct
loans up to a million dollars to
fund operation
expenses, uh
payroll utilities
uh help out with rent
payments during
um during
COVID um eligible
entities were either
for profit or
nonprofit essential
services which include
uh hospitals, uh
behavioral health clinics,
substance abuse providers,
dentists, childcare
operators, uh health
care facilities,
pharmacies, medical
supplies and research
facilities.
Um How those
loans were structured
were a line of
credit for one year that
was converted up to a term
loan for up to five
years. Um
Most of the loans were
secured by business
assets, personal
guarantees for
owners and then
that are the owners
that are greater than
20%. The
interest rate for the program
was at 1% and there was
no application fee,
clos of fees or no
prepayment penalties
penalties
on page 10
is the results
of the loans that we made
from the essential Services
Working Capital Program.
Um As you can see,
there were the
we uh
were approximately
5,000,005
$0.5 million of loan,
direct loans that were
made.
And um
we have a outstanding
balance of approximately
$889,000.
Um And most of the loans are
current are paid
in full. And so
as you can see, we
uh ring IR
which, which is a
um a research
facility that was doing
viral detection and screening
for COVID, they have
$6 left. So that loan is
gonna pay off uh in
the next few weeks. And
then, as you can see, the, the loans
are starting to dwindle down from
the the original
amount
on slide
11 is the
last uh the
last um
fund with
within the Economic
Development Revolving
Fund, Economic
Development Revolving Fund
program. Uh
The Cannabis Microbus
program was a pilot business
that we created to
support uh the can
the emerging cannabis
industry in New Mexico
we provided uh a
direct working capital
loans up to
$250,000
to licensed microbusinesses.
The interest rates were ranged
between 2 to 3%
depending on the amount
that they receive.
And, and also the
terms were from 3
to 5 years.
Right now, we're, we're not
accepting any applications.
We, what we found is
the, the industry
is still, uh,
very new and
still hard to underwrite
and, and therefore we
experience high
underwriting costs.
Also, the collateral
was difficult to, to
evaluate and, and
to meet different uh
collateral requirements
that that will allow the
finance authority to feel
secure uh with the
loans. And then the industry
volatility is still
uh still there and
we, we just couldn't underwrite
for that particular
uh that
particular.
And what you see is the loans
that we were able to secure.
And these were some of the best
loans that we were
able to find within
the uh within the
industry. We
have a original
loan amount of a
totaling $1.3
million and that outstanding loan
balance of
$876,000.
So with that, uh
Mr chairman and committee
members, that's the report on
the Economic Development revolving
fund and Stanford
questions.
>> Thank you very much,
Mr Brooks. Do we have any
questions from the
committee?
Representative
Chatfield?
>> Yeah.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
I do know that the Economic
Development Department did
put some funding into a packing
house which I've been
talking about
and uh I do
know that that packing
house uh went
belly up here
some while back
and I have high
hopes that someone will come
in and
revive that thing.
What is the status of it?
It's in, it's in Las Vegas,
New Mexico.
And uh it was
a, a kind of a smaller
type operation. Are
you aware of that or do you, do
you, is that some of the money
that you're talking about or not?
>> Um Mr Chairman
Representative, I am
not familiar with the project
because that was through the Economic
Development Department and so
whatever funds that they
provided to them, I I'm
I'm not aware of. >> So it's
not part of the fund you
were talking about. When you
say the Economic
Development Fund, you're
not talking about the Economic
Development Departments
fund, >> Mr Chairman
Representative. That's correct. So
whatever funds, whatever
projects they fund through their
programs, we're not aware
of >> that.
That's what I didn't, wasn't
too sure as I was listening to
you talk about Economic
Development Fund. I didn't know if
it was tied to the economic
development part B
part. Thank >> you.
Thank you.
>> OK, thank you representative.
Any other questions? I
just have probably one.
Sure and that's on
uh let's see,
have it,
it is on the
um
cannabis
Microbus loan.
So do you take
into account? Well, this is
closed now, is that what I understood you to
say, >> Mr Chairman that is correct.
We are at this time
no longer accepting
applications. >> OK.
Is there a criteria on
the application form
essentially a
density
in your area to make
sure that, I mean, a lot of these folks, I, I
feel like they're gonna get clobbered.
I mean, I, I'm driving down forth to
go get my haircut once you find it doesn't
look very good today. But when
I, when I uh
when you find someone who does a good
job cutting your hair, I know Representative
Delacruz, nobody can have that kind of
hair. So,
but I'm driving down there and, and I'm literally
counting every time I go and I
count even more
places each time.
And I'm just wondering about these
business folk that they're
putting everything
they have into this. Um
Are, are you,
are you using that as a criteria at
all? >> Uh Mr
Chair? Yeah, Mr
Chair. Um When we,
when we looked at that, when
we didn't look at the density
at that point in time,
uh since the, the
program was new and we were
still learning about the
business. Um One
of the things I could, can
say is that that
should have been something we looked
at because the density is,
is big.
Um Like you, I live here
in Albuquerque and I go
get my haircut and
you know, somewhere close to
Fourth Street. Um
And I see it, I see
the density a amongst
the, the different uh
shops and
there's, there's times where
you'll see a shop,
um, you know,
in a corner there will be
three shops in, in the,
in the same area. And
it's i, it's hard
to, um,
underwrite that at that
point in time when we were writing
under, uh, had this program,
it was hard to underwrite that
particular
situation.
>> Well, thank you. And I know that you're
not charged with
managing what this industry does.
You're simply charged with managing
the application for these
funds. And so I'm glad
that you have a limit on it so that,
you know, there's a lot of other skin in the game
as it will to, to get
these things done the right way.
>> Yeah, Mr Chair and we were
one of the things we were hoping
was C CD was
gonna help us out with managing
the license and give
us a, you know, a
whole breath of the
industry and that
relationship. It,
you know, it, it didn't
pan out the way we, we
wanted it to. >> So does
the um um, uh
Mr Brooks does
the,
the applicant have to tell you
what's in their
one mile radius, five
mile radius. So
there's, you have to go out and do that
research yourself or how's that
done >> Mr Chair?
We would have to go out and do that research
ourselves. We, we would
have to go out. I mean,
we did site visits
and, and,
and looked at
all the areas that some of
these investments were made.
But at that time,
you know, they were one
of one and then, you know,
by the time we
made the loan, they were
one of five
>> because those other four
didn't have to go to you. They may
have had other sources and
you did those site visits. Mr
Brooks. Did you sample
the products to make sure
that
>> Mr Chair? No, the
>> purity density
just of action. I know
>> Mr Chair on a
couple of the site visit.
I
they were speaking another
language
so I, I don't understand it. I'm not gonna put
it in my body. Okd.
>> Understood. I
just hope that we, we
protect some of these folks that
are gonna very,
very worried about some of these small businesses
and how that's gonna go for them. So,
yeah. Ok. Well, thank
you very much. Any other comments?
Questions?
Ok. If not, we'll stand in
recess to tomorrow morning
committee, please. Please please
be here just before 9
a.m.
Can we leave all of our stuff
here and you
can leave all your stuff here,
everybody,
anything you want to leave?
