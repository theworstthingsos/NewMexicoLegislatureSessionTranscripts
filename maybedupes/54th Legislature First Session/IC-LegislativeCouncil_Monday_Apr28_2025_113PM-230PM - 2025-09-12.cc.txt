father passed away just a few
weeks ago, uh, he became uh
pretty ill about halfway through
the session, um, and I cannot
thank all of you enough for your
kindness and compassion, even
not really knowing what was
happening. Uh, you all showed me
a great deal of love and
appreciation, um, uh, especially
when I think my, my team led by
Alicia Man.
I know as well as their
leadership team, um, here to my
right for uh picking, picking up
the slack, um, you know, I was
gone for 3rd reading a few times
here and there, um, but I, I
just want to tell you how much
it meant to me to have your
support, your love,
appreciation, compassion, um,
you know, we often talk about
this building being a part of
that.
Uh, over the course of those,
um, you know, last 4 weeks of
session, and then the last 6
weeks from, uh, you know,
beautiful flowers that all of
you have sent all the way to
your thoughts, text messages,

Alright. Let me, let me clean up
my messes real quick and then we
buy.
While you're cleaning up your
messes, Mister Speaker. Let me
just make an announcement that
to my members, uh, if I've
gotten it wrong, let me know if
I've appointed you to something
you don't want to be appointed
to, really let me know that.
Um, if you'd rather be an
advisory rather than a voting,
let me know that.
Uh, I did the best I could with
basically only this weekend to
work on it. It's a little busy
previous 3 weeks, uh, so, uh,
I've probably made some errors.
And that's OK.
OK, um.
I'm gonna start from
The most recent
Mess up and work.
Um
OK, so on science and
technology,
Um, there were 2 Republican
appointments made in error as
voting members, so I appointed
Baca in Terasas.
It should be.
Joshua Hernandez, Alan Martinez
is voting.
And then Armstrong is advisory.
Got it? Yeah, that's mess up
number one.
Um, next, I'm gonna go back to
CCJ.
And these will be advisory
appointments, Republicans, 2 CCJ
and those will be
Alan Martinez.
Armstrong.
Lord
And block
Yeah
Am I good?
I can't, I can't, I can't read
lips.
Advisory. So Suansky and Small.
OK, put them on as advisory.
OK, also, let's go to LESC and
water and let's appoint Chairman
Small as advisory to those two.
And then let's go to ethics.
We will add 2 advisory members
to legislative ethics
representatives Pettigrew and
Cullin.
And I think that brings up my
message.
All right, before I continue
making more messes, uh, a couple
of proposals that we have for
this council to consider.
Um
The first one is
An interim
committee for this interim only,
so this year.
On federal infrastructure funds
and stability.
And I've uh talked to both, um,
uh, leaders in my talk in in my
chamber as well as the Senate
forte about this over.
Over the last day or so, a
couple of days or so.
Um, the idea is to set up.
A essentially a committee that
will
help create an inventory
proactively.
Of federal funds flowing into
New Mexico for both
infrastructure as well as for
local governments. Uh, the idea
is to create um a, an inventory
list of sorts and provide some
recommendations with regard to
both recurring and non-recurring
funds, as well as fee-based
revenues that might be coming
into the state, uh,
specifically, this is not meant
to duplicate the work that LSC
is going to do or LES, he's
gonna do her LHHS is gonna do, I
think.
that those committees given the
purview that they have over so
much of our state budget, they
will do their due diligence.
This is meant to supplement some
of that work and to have a
proactive approach to deal with
any potential, potential
reductions in federal funding.
Um, it is a, uh, you know, what
I consider will be a very nuts
and bolts, uh, committee. It's a
very tailor tailored and
uh specific focus that it will
have, uh, we have envisioned.
5 members
chamber
Um, proportional to, to
political representation, uh,
with existing staff of the
legislative council, and thank
you, Mrs. Casebe for being so
open and flexible with us, uh,
with existing staff overseeing,
helping oversee some of that day
to day work, um.
Madam Protem, I don't know if
you want to add anything to
that, um.
Uh, before we maybe open up for
some questions and folks have
some questions.
Uh, thanks, Mr. Speaker. So, uh,
The envisioning includes like
perhaps only need it for a year.
might need it for more than
that, we can tell.
Um
I mean, I think this is
important to have a small
committee drill down onto this,
so, uh,
And we've put these people
together pretty quickly this
morning. I know you came
prepared, so we became prepared
also. Um, I really wanna say uh
I'm gonna put people on this
committee without asking them,
so if you really don't want to
do it, let me know, or if you
really wish you had been on
there. Let me know.
Right. Are there any questions
or any things we need to
clarify? OK. So on the house
side, uh, the do we need to get
in a motion to approve this
committee first.
Um, Mr. Chair, if the council
would, yes, like to create the
committee first and then make
the appointments. I think that'd
be most proper. Is there a
motion to approve um the
inclusion of the federal funding
stabilization Committee.
Right? Is there any objection?
See none committees created.
The house will appoint.
The following representatives to
this committee, uh, our co-chair
for the house will be
Representative Lustrom.
Here
Lada
Duncan and Brown.
From the Senate, our co-chair
will be Senator Bill Souls.
Senator Munoz.
To heal
Townsend and Woods.
Right.
Um, and then we have this is
gonna seem very
Backwards, but um I think we
have a good idea here.
Uh, one of the areas of
frustration that the my co-chair
and I have had over the last
couple of years is how many
interim committees we have.
Um, and I was reminded, for
example, that the transportation
infrastructure subcommittee was
really created to figure out
permanent funding streams for
transportation projects, but
it's sort of just morphed into a
more permanent thing, uh, for
better or for worse, uh, but the
one area where we find ourselves
constantly, several times a
month during the interim dealing
with is our incredible council
staff texting us and saying,
hey, we don't have a quote.
Or whatever interim committee
meeting might be meeting. Um,
the reason that's a problem
obviously is official business
can really be conducted, uh, but
also for the members who do show
up, maybe they traveled far.
They can't even get per diem to
cover their gas or their
lodging, because if there's not
a quorum, there's not an
official meeting. And so we time
and time again have had to
appoint uh from advisory members
who are in the room, or even
sometimes other legislators are
in the room in order to make
forum. So, uh, Madam Perte and
I, um, have been talking about
creating a work group, I guess
we didn't have to call it a
committee, a work, um, and, uh,
by way of volume volunteering
some of you, we thought
we could appoint our 4 whips to
whips from each of the chambers
between now and, you know,
October, November, uh, do an
inventory of these interim
committees, look at attendance
records, uh, look at how many
times the co-chairs of council
have had to approve members to
show up to to to to to make
quorum, and then recommend to
us, uh, maybe some consolidation
of some committees, uh, maybe
reduction in terms of members of
some committees.
Uh, maybe eliminating some
committees altogether.
Um, and so, um, Shaw, I don't
know that we need to vote for
this one if we're creating a
work group. I mean for per diem
purposes, I guess.
Uh, Mr. Chair, that's a very
good point. I think that would
be most proper to have a vote.
Uh, thank you, Mr. Speaker for
uh bringing this up. I
The thing that really irks me is
how many committee members we
appoint to these committees, and
everyone is interested in these
issues, so it's a good thing
that people want to go to
interim committees, but it
doesn't make them function very
well.
When you have, we have one
committee that we've just
appointed 21 members as voting
members.
You know, that means you've got
to have 12 people, 12 voting
members before you have a
quorum.
So, um, I, I believe many of our
committees are too big, um.
You know, if we didn't have the
quorum issues, I wouldn't be
saying this, uh, so I, I really
want people to want to go to the
committees for which they are
appointed as voting member.
I've looked at the absence list.
We have some people who ask for
all these committees and never
show up.
Never show up. So I've left them
off my appointment list, but I
don't think that's the answer
either. So, so we're really
hoping our little 4 whips can
whip this into shape and come up
with some solutions and
suggestions, so we don't overlap
as much so that we don't have as
many committees with that many
people or whatever, they can
think of for reforms, so then
they would report back to the
council service.
perhaps
they could come up with
something that we would do next
year or the year after.
So I think it's just a great
idea. I hope the whips liked it
too.
Yes, ma'am
Senator woods.
OK, I don't, I don't mind being
on the, on the committee, but
what kind of information are you
gonna give us?
to make these decisions.
That's, you know, I don't mind
making a decision, as long as
you give me the information, I
can make a decision with
could, I mean, I get the speaker
and I get a lot of help in
putting these committees
together.
Including attendance sheets that
shows you who shows up and who
doesn't. You would have that.
Um, you have all these staff
members that have tons of
information about how many days,
what it costs, how many days
there wasn't a quorum, how many
times they had to call both of
us for quorums. Um, so we've got
all that data. So I'm assuming
this wouldn't even start until
council service was readied and
to data or perhaps they could
email it to you. Um, so, um,
The data is there, and you
experience it when you go to
interim committees, so, um,
yeah, well, you'll get a lot of
data and then you can sort
through it and see if you can
make head or tail of it.
Center but
Uh, thank you, Mr. Chair and
Madam Chair, I think it's a
great idea and I'm happy to help
with this. Uh, I think the data
will be fantastic. So we would
have just a little bit of
administrative support and, and
support that way to kind of get
it all put together before we
present it back to the entire
committee. Thank you. Just want
to clarify that on the record
because
We're all very busy too.
Is there?
Um, I think we should take a
vote just if you all come
together in person, you should
be able to get per diem, um, so
is there a?
The motion to approve this
working group out of there
opposition to that motion?
I see none. We've got a work
group to dwindle down their
interns.
Or maybe you'll recommend that
we increase the numbers,
which would be ironic.
All right, yeah, um, OK, I've
got a, I've got clean one more
thing up, um, advisory to Indian
Affairs Committee.
Representative Thompson and um
Just for the record, Thompson
adviser to the Indian Affairs
Committee. Um, is there a motion
to adopt all of these
appointments that we've made
today.
Right?
Is there opposition to our
appointments.
They see none the 2020.
5 2026 interim committee
appointments have been adopted.
OK. Um, let's go to the next um
item here, um.
OK. Let me go to Shana for the
next part. Mr. Chair, if I may,
uh, if the council uh wishes to
entertain two other motions that
are traditionally, uh, put forth
at this meeting. Um, one is to
allow the protein speaker to
revise, make appointments as may
be needed in accordance with
proportional representation,
party membership, appointing
authority, etc. um, if the
council would like to, um,
entertain such emotion. The
other is, um,
Uh, really, uh, uh, yeah, motion
that gets made every year and,
and perhaps a statutory change,
um, would like to be
contemplated on it. There is a
capital kitchen fund, and
traditionally, the council will
entertain a motion to use that
capital kitchen fund for
incidental expenses of the
interim committees such as
coffee. Uh, so there's just two
traditional motions if the
council wishes to review them.
Let's seeking by one by one,
let's go to the first one,
motion to allow prote and myself
to revise and make appointments
as needed in a.
in accordance to proportional
representation, party
membership.
Appointing authority, etc.
right? Is there opposition to
that motion, not a motion
carries.
second motion is to use Capital
Kitchen Fund for incidental
expenses of the interim
committees including coffee and
supplies for the meeting.
The motion.
Right? Any opposition to that
motion?
Non-motion carries. In this
case, we are back to you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um, and
with these appointments having
been made, council service staff
will notify all members of their
appointments, and then the lead
staff for each of the committees
will be in touch with the chairs
of those committees to uh start
planning the organizational
meetings, uh, that will take
place, uh, later on in May and
June.
Uh, Mr. Speaker, uh, Mr. Chair,
would you like me to go on to
the next item of business.
Please go ahead. Thank you, Mr.
Chair. So per legislative
council policy 27 Legislative
district offices, uh,
legislative council service is
responsible for providing the
district offices with all
necessary supplies to, uh, to
operate. Uh, that includes
equipment such as IT equipment,
uh, general office supply
equipment, furniture, signage
for those offices, etc. Um,
however, per the policy says any
unreasonable.
extraordinary costs are to be
referred to the Legislative
Council for review and approval.
So we recently received a
request to have a banner
printed. Uh, this is for use at,
say, open houses of the district
office. Um, this particular
office is shared by 3
legislative members, um, for
both chambers.
And while I understand this to
be kind of an occasional need,
um, and, and surely would be
helpful for this open house, um,
and it is signage. I do not
believe that this type of
signage is what was envisioned
through the policy. It's not a
day to day operational expense.
Accordingly, I'm bringing this
request to the council for your
consideration. State printing
has quoted us approximately $500
for the creation of the spanner.
I think this is a banner that
would be strung out, uh, maybe
outside of the office. I could
be visible from the street and
apprise.
at this office exists and is
having an open house. And with
any request for the district
offices, you know, we are
certainly working on the
principle that if it's provided
to one office that the same
supplies should be available,
made available to the other
other offices as well. Um, and
we also, if the request is
fulfilled, want to ensure that
there's consistency in the
product and the supplies that
are being provided to the
offices. Um, so with that, I
stand for questions on this
requirement. Any questions on
the banner, Senator share.
Mr. Chair, just didn't.
Roughly how much money are we
talking about? I mean, is it $10
a banner or $500 a banner.
Thank you.
What's uh
500 times 112.
Any questions, uh, Madamrote?
Uh, Mr. Speaker, it seems to me
this is um sort of beyond what
we consider every day office
supplies that all of these
offices are gonna have this
seems to me if this one is a
special occasion that the, the,
the reps are senators can.
can join their money and buy buy
their own banner. It seems like
this is kind of outside of what
we envision. That's my personal
opinion, of course, so I suggest
we not approve this, but again,
my personal opinion.
Represents Mr. Chairman and
director.
It does each district office
have a supplies budget that they
have been allocated.
Mr. Chair, Madam Leader, uh,
we're in process of um
configuring a budget that would
um allow for incidental supplies
or, you know, really special
supplies at each office um may
want that are not just common
everyday supplies, so we are, we
are in process of working out
that, um, budget, um, but kind
of everyday, day to day
operational supplies, when those
requests come in, uh, we've been
assessing whether this is a uh
reasonable uh everyday.
uh need of that office. Um, this
one in particular seemed a
little, it was just on my gut
check, it felt a little outside
of that everyday, day to day
operations, um, but yes, to
answer your question, um,
budgets are being worked on and
the work they will be proposed
to the working group, um, and
then ultimately to the council
for your approval.
Um
Mr. Speaker and director, I
would just
My personal view would be uh.
I don't really know that it's,
it's.
Relevant to the council to be in
the position of approving
individual expenses, all the
time, so I would encourage that
the policy that we.
Adopt in the future regarding
these supplies allows a bit of
autonomy so that each if each
office is allocated.
$100 a year for supplies.
And they would like to purchase
a $500 banner that they could
merge those supply budgets,
purchase that banner with the
caveat that then they have run
out their entire supplies
budget, right? And so any
additional supplies would be uh
something that would be out of
pocket, um.
I would suggest that, or I would
suggest us to adopt a policy of
a uh.
A purchase threshold so that any
item over.
$1000 is approved by work group
or buy or, you know, and I'm
just.
Making uh uh suggestions on the
dollar amounts are randomly, but
I, I think to me that would be a
sustainable approach for
approving individual
expenditures like that because
I'm sure there will be some
districts where.
Some kind of specialized item is
required and it's relevant to
that community. Um, maybe it's a
more rural community or maybe
there's a.
certain language that's spoken
would require some kind of
specialized communication.
And I don't want to discourage
that, but, but allowing for the
offices to make those decisions
with some autonomy, I think it
is helpful so that we're not in
a position of having to continue
to come back on individual items
more frequently than is
appropriate. So that would just
be some suggestions.
Thank you. Thank you.
Uh, thank you, Mr. Speaker, Mr.
Chairman, um, uh, you know, this
is where we're getting in
trouble.
In my opinion, by putting the
cart before the horse by
creating this before we had the
The actual creation of how it
was actually going to work.
And so these are the problems
we're going to keep running into
until we
I, I really like leader
Sapansky's idea of having a
budget for each one. this is
coming from the lady with the
largest largest house district
in the state.
Where my DLA is going to be
traveling from Tier C to
Valencia County.
Weekly.
But we don't have per diem yet.
And so these are the kinds of
problems that we're going to
keep running into. So if, if I
Um,
you know, my DLA is driving to
Albuquerque tomorrow to pick up
her computer and it's just it's
a lot of incidents that we're
going to run into, uh, until we
get this, this budgeting and
possibly per diem, whatever else
we need, um.
Uh
The sooner the better, because
it's just gonna keep happening
and I'm really excited for my
DLA. I have to say I'm, I like
the idea. Some people don't like
the idea. I'm extremely excited
because I need the help. So, uh,
not that my staff doesn't do it,
but my staff is is uh.
Spread very thin with all of our
members and to have someone
specifically focusing on the
things that I need, it's gonna
be awesome and constituent
services is the most fun part of
my job.
As the legislator, so.
Thank you.
Thank you, Representative
Representative Martinez.
Mr. Chairman, uh, I agree with
the two leaders, um, ideas on an
overall budget, but I want to
drill down to the specific.
Request
Um
It might understand that they're
the request is for a banner
announcing that the office is
open Cherry, yes, essentially it
would be a, a banner that could
be used. There's some open house
days that are being planned,
that's my understanding. And so
this banner would be uh up and
visible to, you know, people on
the streets in the neighborhood
on those open house days.
Um
Thank you for that. Um.
Mr. Chairman
I, I, I just
I worry that then this leads to
other requests.
Um.
You know,
I want to pay for a radio spot,
I wanna.
For an ad in the newspaper, I
want.
All this stuff
We need to
Be very careful with how we
spend taxpayers.
People know that my office is
open.
It's been in the paper, word of
mouth gets around.
I have phone calls, my DLA calls
me.
Um, you need to make this
meeting, you need to.
Make this phone call.
We need to be very careful about
spending $500 on a banner.
It's going to announce something
that should be.
Taken care of already.
Uh, it just, it concerns me that
this is going to lead to other
things.
Um
I just wanted to make sure that
We kept that in mind. Thank you,
Mr. Chairman.
Representative, representative
Huckman Hill.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just
want to reiterate, I think the
leader's ideas are really good
one.
Um, just giving folks of
supplies budget up to a certain
amount if they so choose to
spend that budget on things like
banners, they can make that
choice, uh, knowing that.
They may not have money for
other supplies in the future,
um, I think that kind of
rectifies the other concerns of
the slippery slope here, um,
but, you know, if you want to
spend their supplies money on
something like this, they can,
and if not, they won't. Thank
you.
Right.
So it sounds like the council
does not want to approve this
specific request to purchase
this specific banner, but rather
pick it back to council so that
when you develop your budgets,
each office could theoretically
buy a one-time banner
understanding that that is
potentially the entirety of
their supplies budget. So, um, I
don't think we need to take a
vote on it. It sounds like we're
all pretty much on the same
page.
Yeah.
Right.
Well, we'll uh we'll go to the
next uh next part, this case
beer.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and, um,
thank you, members for that
discussion as well as it was
very helpful guidance too. Thank
you. Uh, so the next, um, item
is staff reports. And, uh,
first, I'm very excited to
introduce you to Monica Ewing.
Uh, you may have worked with her
this session. She came back as a
contract drafter, um, but Monica
has been hired as the new
assistant director for drafting
Services and has taken on the
crucial role of managing the
council services, uh, bill
drafting, legal research and
interim committee staffing
operations. Uh, Monaco is a
staff.
attorney with the council
service for many years
previously, and I'm just, uh,
very overjoyed to have her
support in this capacity. So,
um.
Uh, thank you. And, uh, Mr.
Chair, next, um, as it's been
done previously at the start of
the interim, uh, the council
service would like to provide a
basic interim committee training
uh to specifically to new
members of the legislature, um,
but of course, all legislators
will be invited to attend this
training. It really would just
go over the basics of, um, you
know, notifying staff of
attendance or non-attendance,
uh, what's a quorum? What's a
subcommittee? How do you fill up
the vouchers to get
reimbursement? What are travel
policies regarding in-state?
or out of state conferences, um,
additional topics maybe, you
know, drafting and legal
research services, uh, maybe
constituent services from the
chief clerk's office, etc. So we
are looking to hold this
training in the next couple of
weeks, hopefully late May, early
June, um, I anticipate it to be
maybe 60 to 90 minutes long. Um,
it'd be done via Zoom, um, and
all legislators again will be
invited to participate. So
hopefully that'll be helpful in
orienting our, uh, our new
members to the interim process.
Right
Um, next staff report, um, I've
been advised that Senate
Memorial 2 was passed by the
Senate this year. Uh, it
requests the Legislative council
to direct the creation of a
study group to study, develop
and make recommendations to the
appropriate interim legislative
committees on a comprehensive
statewide approach to address,
avoid and mitigate wildfires,
including recommendations for
funding and proposed
legislation. The forestry
division of Energy, Minerals and
Natural Resources is available
to help coordinate this
undertaking.
And is being requested that the
Legislative council direct the
council service to coordinate
with the forestry division to
facilitate this.
Right, do we?
Uh, Senator Woods. Thank you,
Mr. Speaker. Uh, this was a
memorial that I carried this, I
think is uh
Is more to, to accumulate the
information.
That's out there already.
It's got a specific number of
people designated to do this
specific.
Uh, uh, to the agency specific
to the, the advocates specific
group to come together and try
to determine best practices.
Uh, on this wildfire.
That we have the, the whole
issue that we have going to
harden the systems, the hardened
the utilities, to harden
whatever we can, the Speaker
and, and I don't think it'll be
that great a cost council
service, but it has to be
directed.
The way the, the memorial is
written, it has to be directed
from council service.
To, to the state forester to do
this.
So that is the request, and I
would make a motion for that.
Um, Senator Worth, did you want
to jump in on this?
OK.
Um, I think we all agree.
To your requests. I don't think
we need to take a vote unless
you want to have one for the
record.
So we don't need to make a
motion. I don't think we need to
vote. Do we need to vote? It
just direct you to do it, right?
Uh, Mr. Chair, that is correct.
You can direct, uh, counsel
service to undertake this.
Bro.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Speaker, so
it's my understanding that
that's what the council service
is going to do. They're notified
in here and they've already
started uh talking with Laura
McCarthy, so this is in the
process and their health being
and it's kind of their job to do
it, uh, by the memorial, so I
don't think we need to do a
vote, but we could if you want.
Uh uh not in particular for my
gratification as long as
We direct you, well let's.
Consider yourself directed,
counsel.
Mr. Chair.
Uh, OK, just a couple of, uh,
other issues here briefly. Um,
so as required, as is required
by legislative council policy
12, which is about legislative
space, uh, the director has the
ability to allow, um, incidental
uses of the chambers for um
educational purposes for, you
know, say student groups that
are learning about the
governmental processes. So I'm
just reporting to the council
that the New Mexico Youth and
Government program hosted by the
YMCA held its annual session
conference earlier this month
and was allowed use of the.
chambers and committee rooms for
this purpose.
And moving on to other building
issues, um, at the Legislative
council meeting in December.
I reported to the facilities
Review subcommittee, um, that,
uh, building services and
council service we're moving on
a project to renovate the
Capitol concourse, and, uh, the
subcommittee approved that
project and there's money in the
budget to um move forward on
that, and at that meeting, some
members write questions about
the uh stucco on the exterior of
the building.
And uh that is also a very
necessary project. Um, and in
the meantime, since that last
meeting, we have had the
opportunity to meet with the
contractors who'd be working on,
say, the concourse and the
stucco project, and it's their
professional opinion that it
would be best to do the stucco
first, uh, because in order to
do the stucco project, there has
to be a lot of scaffolding that
is put up the contractors are
very concerned about putting
that scaffolding on brand new
concrete slab, and the
additional precautions and
protections that would need to
be
put in place in order to protect
a brand new slab if we do the
concourse project first. So
based on this uh professional
recommendation, uh, we're going
to start moving forward with a
stucco project, um, also looking
at how we can prioritize uh the
most uh needed areas of the
concourse for renovation. It's
my understanding that the north
and the east sides of the
concourse are in the most
detriment at the moment. And so
we're looking at phasing in a
project so that we can um
address those.
immediate, um, you know, the,
the largest needs of the
concourse, while at the same
time also proceeding with the
stucco project, which is also a
very necessary and, um,
important for the, the
aesthetics and the outside, um,
envelope of the building. So I
just wanted to let you know of
that, um, we do hope to complete
uh both and at least uh
hopefully a part of the
Concourse project before session
starts. Um, but time is of the
essence and and weather delays
and and getting contractors and
subcontractor.
s you know, all of the right
pieces in place, um, does take
some time, and we certainly want
to make sure that it's done
correctly. So that is the status
of that project at this moment.
Thank you, um, actually I have a
quick question. So have you
identified your contract with a
subcontractors at this point.
Mr. Chair, we have, um, there
are contractors on statewide
price agreements who are um of
very high reputation. We've
worked with them before, and
those are the contractors we're
currently working with.
And uh lastly on uh building
issues, uh, there was a, uh,
sorry, heating, um, and air
conditioning and HVAC project,
uh, that was begun a year or so
ago, the main Capitol building
has been completed. Uh, this was
an upgrade to the heating and
cooling, um, adjustment
mechanisms and mechanics of that
system. So uh just uh a notice
that this 8 track temperature
control system upgrade at the
Walter Ky Memorial Walkway in
Capitol North, including
Boilers and cooling tower
replacement project. We'll start
this week, and there may be some
challenges with keeping those
spaces cool, uh, during the
tower replacement phase, but we
are um looking at options, um,
should the weather be um too
warm, uh, without air
conditioning, and we will keep
all occupants um apprised, um,
of the progress on that project.
So that concludes the um staff
reports. Um, my last note is
that a next council meeting is
tentatively scheduled for June
23rd. And with that, I stand for
questions.
Any questions for our council
director.
Senator Woods
Just quickly, uh,
I took it upon myself to ask a
few questions this morning about
uh
The Secretary of State, we did,
we did put money in the budget
for
him to move and
So I went around and made some
inquiries and it sounded like
they had no desire.
To move whatsoever.
Uh, I was told, don't expect it
over the next 2 years. Uh, I did
talk to
Uh, legislative finance.
And they did tell me that uh we
did put in money for them to
move and we did locate a
A space for him to move to.
But, uh, first I would make that
inquiry.
And that's what I found out. So,
no particular questions to you,
Shawna, but
And if you have any other
information on that, I'd be glad
to hear it, but
That's the way I understand the
deal, uh, legislative finance
committee actually said they
were.
Trying to remodel some cloth,
get some more office space.
So just saying thank you, Mr.
Chair.
I'm sorry, before, uh, Senator
Doha.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and this
is not directly on point. I have
a a DLA question so what
Senator,
Senator Mr. Chair, I appreciate
Senator Woods, you looking into
the status. I know we went
through a similar discussion
with the administrative office
of the courts, uh, that didn't
want to move.
Uh, but I just, you know, with
the executive office building,
still kind of floating around
out there and just the continued
need for space, both with the
council. We had a discussion in
Senate leadership about analysts
on top of each other, creating
all kinds of issues. We have got
to move forward and understand
that
You know, this is, this is our
building, and we've got to use
the space that's here to take
care of our needs, um, you know,
we've added all these new DLA
physicians and the requirements
for that, the staffing for that.
So I just, you know, we've got
to be careful about I realized
no one likes change.
But we need to make some change
to take care of our folks and
take care of our members. So I
just wanted to make that pitch
and appreciate you looking into
it. Um,
And again
Obviously up to the Secretary of
State to be looking for space, I
would just encourage them to
To do that, on this topic.
It's gonna do it again.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um, so I
have a a DLA question. There was
a a town hall yesterday, uh,
where
Some of the DLAs were told they
were not allowed to go, um,
because it was put on by wards
in the district, um,
And so Senator O'Malley's DLA
was told she was not allowed to
go. I wasn't able to attend, so
I sent my DLA in my place. I'm
looking at the, the policies
about kind of
What DLE DLAs can and can't do,
and I, I don't see that.
That they would not be allowed
to come to a, a post session
town hall like this, just
because it was a war, a
democratic war, putting it on,
um, so I'm a little confused
because I, I, I apparently they
were heard they were hearing
that from the HR person, uh, for
the DLAs.
Mr. Chair, Senator Duhague, um,
I would love to look into the
details of that situation a
little bit more and and follow
up with you, uh, later on, uh,
whether there is or is not, um,
some conflict with that
attendance.
Thank you Mr. Cha, and excuse
me, yeah, I think, I think the
more clarity we have around
stuff like that, the better.
you.
Right.
Um, before I go to the prote for
some comments, um.
I'd like to go back to.
Capital
Security subcommittee. I would
like to add to that
representative Alan Martinez
that
3% of Alan Martinez of capital
security.
Adam Pluton.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'll
probably have to fix my errors
in these committees a month from
now. I'm, I'm not getting any
texts from anyone.
Um, I just want to announce that
I'm gonna do this multiple times
that CSG West has a Colorado
River Forum.
This year, we have one the
Colorado River Forum to be here
in New Mexico. I'm the co-chair
this next year.
Careful what you ask for, uh, so
it's going to be November 1213
and 14 in Santa Fe at La Fonda.
Uh, uh, when we get closer, then
um I'll ask for more, and I'll
ask for people to be on, uh,
meetings, forums, etc. but uh if
you can kind of put that in your
calendar and if whoever does the
committee meetings will try to
keep that. I don't know if LFC
is already uh gotten those
dates. I know LESC has not, so,
um, if we can hang on to those
dates so that everybody can go
to this, just just for you all
to know.
Um, by the end of 2026, we have
to come up with revision to the
compact at the 7 states are in.
It ends next year, not the
compact, but the current
provisions of compact, so we all
are working on that, uh, and Mr.
Speaker, if you could get to a
appointees to that Colorado
River for. I'm going to appoint
Senator Steve Lanier as the
other person in the Senate.
Uh, so we get 2 votes, but all
of us can come to the forum. It
it's very interesting. I went to
the one in Phoenix last year was
very interesting to see how the
other states are dealing with
water, um.
Uh
water from the Colorado River,
so it'll be interesting, it's
important, so if you can just
hang on to those dates. Thank
you. Thank you, Madam.
Any other questions or comments
from council members.
Right, see, none, our next
meeting is June 23rd,
tentatively scheduled, uh, it
would be the same time, one
o'clock. Um, so if there is
