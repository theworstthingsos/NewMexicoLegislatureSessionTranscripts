I'm yelling but not talking to
my mic.
Um
Thank you. Uh Thanks again
to uh Charlie
Marquez and uh Marla
Schulz uh for our
lunch. Uh It was uh
tasty.
Um Our first
panel this afternoon is strategies
to mitigate climate
change. Uh And
we are
uh packed. We
have a very impressive
panel and five of
them include. So we
have four here at the table and
apparently we have um
uh edf
online. Uh
So we'll go in the order of
the uh agenda.
Um We have an hour and
15 minutes.
Um We've
had a lot of our
members want to ask questions and have
some discussion. I'd like to
reserve time for
that. Um
So if you could aim
for the
7 to 8
minute mark, less
than 10 minutes would be preferred
if, if we go 10
minutes or over.
Um I don't, I
worry about having to find
for questions.
Um So first up
is Rebecca Pucker
with
uh
EMD
whenever you're
ready.
>> Good afternoon chair and members
of the committee. My name is
Rebecca Puck Stare and I am
the current Director of
Energy Conservation and Mineral
Energy Conservation and
Management at the Energy
Minerals and Natural Resources
Department, otherwise
affectionately known sometimes as
the State Energy Office.
And I'll be giving a, a brief
update about specifically
our climate change task
force, which we co-chair
along with NMED.
Um and my colleagues here
will comment on some
tangentially on some of the many
other programs that we
are currently
operating or about to operate.
Um So as you know, the
executive order 2019
3
set our greenhouse
gas reduction targets and
created the climate change task
force to bring a whole
of government approach to addressing
the problem. Um
with the M Nerd and N MD
Secretaries as co-chair
um the climate change
task force, we convened uh
secretaries or their designees
from the 26 different state
agencies and developments.
And we formed uh a
sector specific climate
action team otherwise known
as AC A T uh to
propose plan and implement
state strategies to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions
and to immigrate in
integrate climate
adaptation and mitigation into
agency programs
and statewide
policy.
Um Next slide please.
Um And so since then,
we have uh worked
to meet some of the goals set
forth in the executive order
including meeting quarterly
developing strategies,
establishing interagency,
uh CS
and con convening
a climate equity working
group or a tag.
Um Presently,
we've largely completed
a lot of the specific items
from the 2019 executive
orders, but without
reaching the emissions targets
for the state um
A full C because of that
side work, the full CCTF
meeting has not been convened since
2022.
Most of the cats have ceased
meeting. However, specifically
the transportation cat and the
climate adaptation and
resilience um Interagency
workgroup have continued to meet
working on specific goals
um such as drafting the state
climate adaptation and resilience
plan.
Next slide, please.
Um And we have
some specific actions regarding
or connected to the
CPR G grant,
which is a part of the
Inflation Reduction Act. CPR
G stands for climate
pollution reduction grants
and that has consumed
um much of the work of the
CCTF in recent
months. So since
2023 NMED
and M Nerd formed the
Climate Change and Climate Policy
Bureaus. We've hired
staff and we're currently working
on large scale climate
adaptation and greenhouse
gas reduction action
plans. Um And
both agencies uh
continue
public engagement. Most
notably, we just completed
about eight town halls across
the State of New Mexico looking for
input on to this plan. They were
very successful and very
well attended.
Um
And the initial
framework which organized
state agency staff into climate
action teams was based on
economic sectors, for example,
transportation, cat and oil
and gas, cat,
etcetera.
Um So
looking forward,
um there are some structural
adjustments we may want to consider
to the CCTF.
Um some we've already done
which is pruning
for expediency. The core
team to four or six
members. You can imagine that's a much
smoother meeting than
26
for swifter coordination and
planning and then
as needed, created
smaller temporary tiger
teams to accomplish
specific actions and then dissolve
them. Um
And this
climate,
the CCTF is now
working in sequence, one or
two projects at a time
and with one or two agencies in
a time. And that's essentially
because in effect,
the low hanging fruit
has been accomplished and what lies
ahead of us now are
larger,
slower, more
in depth actions that require
more attention and
consistent direction.
Um Going
forward, the state climate action
could include forming larger
inclusive groups of stakeholders
which are focused on the
implementation of a
specific climate action
mentioned in the CP or for the
C uh in the C
A or the CP, which are
plans related to
the uh the CPR
G. Um
the CCTF or its successor
needs a sustained
public awareness program
that identifies specific
actions, projects,
policies and legislation
funding and
financing to assist New Mexicans
to better prepare for climate
change.
And that concludes my
report.
>> Great. Thank you. Next
up, we have Patrick o'connell from
the PR
C
>> and thank you, Mr chair, committee
members. Uh My name is
Pat o'connell. I am the
chair of the Public Regulation
Commission. I'm
here today to
present uh
the report
to the legislature
on the Renewable Portfolio
Standard. I believe
you received that report
already electronically
and, and uh obviously
don't intend to read it in the
interest of time.
Uh So just
highlight uh
the summary of the report
is that we're on
target for the
achievement of the
2025 renewable
Portfolio standards.
Uh The IO
US are at 40%
standard and
have procured
resources
to sufficiently supply
the number of wrecks that they're gonna
need for
2025. Uh
co ops, we don't have
as much information about
how they're doing. But
what we were able to
observe is that their
electricity suppliers,
western farmers in
tri-state have supplied
them enough to meet their
current RPS standard
and believe that that will
continue when the standard goes
up in 2025.
So again, projection
is that we'll have
compliance on
RPS in
2025.
Uh Report
also addresses challenges
and risks to meeting that
standard and frankly,
uh without the
existing supply chain
challenges, I'd be sitting
here telling you the utilities
have already complied with the
RPS, but they have
quite a few
projects that were
delayed are coming
online this year.
Um And then
especially some of the
two IO us that are
split jurisdiction in
Texas and New Mexico. It's,
it's more of an allocation
issue rather than
are they getting the resources
online yet? Uh
So again,
that's the challenge
and risk that we saw in
getting to
2025.
Uh it's being resolved
on a national level.
Uh And then
because the next ratchet
up from 40% to
50% in five
years. Uh is
frankly
not that hard as
it was to get from
where they were at to the
40%
projecting we should
be in good shape to hit the next
target in 2030.
Uh getting beyond
the 2030 target
to the 80%.
And the net zero target
is really more about
some of the things that you heard this
morning. It's
uh uh technology
innovation, uh
diversifying beyond
just wind and solar.
And so things like this
legislature's support of
geothermal are the kind
of things that the
state and the industry
needs to
continue with
progress. So,
bottom line again,
compliance with RPS,
it's happening reliably
and you'll notice in the
report quite a bit of data
on what these projects cost.
Happy to say it's also
happening affordably.
So I'll turn over
my time to the next
speaker.
>> Great. Thank you uh
Ryan Parks with the
Public School
Facilities
>> Authority.
Thank you, Mr Chair
and members. Thank
you for having me
to this.
Um My name is Ryan Parks. I'm
Deputy Director of Capital
Operations at Public School
Facilities Authority.
Uh We're a small agency
that funds and oversees construction
of Pre K through 12
facilities throughout the
state. Uh
We are staff to the Public
School Capital Outlay
Council.
Um I am an architect
with over 20 years of
experience um specifically
in K 12 education
here in New
Mexico.
Um If you could go to the next slide
um Today I
picked four items
to talk about
um
some things that PSS
A supports and does now
and things that we hope to do in
the future.
Um
Talk a little bit about sustainable
materials, of course,
photovoltaic systems,
high performance building
envelopes and
renovating existing buildings
versus
replacement.
If you turn to slide
two, uh
just real
quick.
Um When we
think of sustainable materials,
we think of low
vo CS, we
think of um
naturally derived materials,
rapidly regrowth materials,
but sustainability goes
beyond that and it goes into
durability of materials.
So when we're specifying
materials on these
facilities, uh
we want them to be able to stand
the test of time.
Um stand up to the
abuse that our wonderful
Children uh
provide in these
schools.
Um
You know, we want
durable materials that don't require
a lot of maintenance or a lot
of constant replacement.
We want them to be up for as long as
possible. And so
when we talk about sustainable
materials at PS fa
uh we mean we mean both
but really we want
materials that are are
durable. We want to
specify materials and
equipment that school staff
know how to maintain.
Um There's a lot of great
technology out there
with uh regards
to
um
greener
heating and ventilation
systems. But we also
need to think about can
the staff in that school district
operate and maintain
these newer systems?
Uh Sometimes
the simplest solution is the
best and it will last longer
because staff can
um staff can maintain
that.
Um But also designing
new schools that will be
better prepared for
renovation in the future,
thinking of more
flexibility in the
spaces.
Um designing
buildings with sound structure
for potential reuse.
And I'll talk more about that
at the end. Uh When, with
regards to
uh replacing versus
repair,
if you could go to the next slide on
foldable text. Yep.
Um So PV
continues to become more
affordable and
reliable and um are
lasting longer. The technology
is, is
um at a point
where it is viable
for schools to be putting these on
the buildings.
Uh You
know, it's, it would help produce
on-site energy.
Uh Facilities are
getting more electrified, the
electrical demand is
increasing
um at, at every
facility, not just pre pre
K through 12 schools
and one way to offset that
would be on-site
photovoltaics.
And also, I
think more importantly
in New Mexico, we have a
lot of rural communities
and districts and
having on site
photovoltaics would
actually create some
resiliency uh
within those communities
in that district.
Um I have one school
district in particular
that um every time
there's a rolling a
blackout
or uh they lose
power. Gosh, they're losing
all the food in their
coolers. Um
And so we're putting a pretty
sizable generator
on that, on that facility.
So creating
that resiliency at the local
level, I we think would
be
beneficial,
move on to uh slide
four.
So
the codes that New Mexico has
adopted, they had,
they do a pretty good job
um of baseline
building envelope requirements.
And what I'm talking about with building
envelope requirements is
moisture
control,
air, air control. So
controlling the air that comes in and
out of your building and most importantly,
thermal control.
Um If we
expand on
these
baselines, if you
will uh
it could create a more
energy efficient building,
thus reducing the amount of
energy required to heat and
cool that
building.
Moving on to uh slide
five, I'll
just read this verbatim.
I know we can all read. But according
to the N ce S
schools with the functional age
of 15 to 34 years are more
likely to report plans for major
repairs, renovation or
replacement than newer
schools.
Some say that after 40
years, a school building begins to
deteriorate rapidly.
Most schools are abandoned. After
60
we have facilities
in this state that are
reaching 100 years
old. Um
Do they all need to be replaced?
Not necessarily
uh but there are several
facilities that need
full replacement.
However,
moving into the future, if
you turn to slide six,
what we really need to consider
is can we
reuse the facilities
that we're currently designing
and building. Can we have a
mindset
that instead of tearing
down every 40 to 60
years, we're actually
designing in better
sustainability and the structure
in the bones if you will.
Uh the president of AAA back
in 2007 said the
greenest building is the one that already
exists.
And one way to think about this
is um the
concept of embodied energy,
the amount of energy that it takes
to build and
construct a school,
the more we save
on an existing facility
and structure, the less
embodied energy
that uh update
will be.
And
so as I mentioned, building
replacement creates high energy
consumption,
a lot of existing
buildings may be able to be renovated
using less resources
and instead of replacing
facilities, let's
design with future renovations
in mind, proper operation
and maintenance of the
facilities will also extend the
life of these buildings.
My agency
has a maintenance and operations
division. We help
all 89 school districts with
preventative maintenance plans
and that is a very
important part of the
longevity of these
buildings uh
and keeping them out
of the repair or
replace for
many more
years.
Many of the school buildings here in
New Mexico are not
conducive to this mindset
yet. We're not there yet,
but we are working
hard to replace
facilities throughout the
state. And as these
newer buildings come
online, uh
we, we do
see the opportunity
for this concept which
is a little different than the way we
think right now. The way we
think right now is the way
um slide five
mentioned, which is
after 15 to
30 years, we're gonna have a major
renovation and
we should just demolish and replace
the whole building after about
60 years. Uh
We should be
starting to think different as we
move forward in in the future
here.
And Mr Chair,
that's
my presentation. Thank
you.
>> Thank you. Next
up, we have
Tammy
Porn. >> Thank
you, Mr, chair members of the committee.
I'm Tammy Feeble Korn. I'm with
Western Resource advocates.
Um Thanks for having me here
today. We wanted to
talk a little bit about
uh tax credits as
a decarbonization tool.
The state has quite a few
tax credits and we have more
coming online soon and
we see this is a really important
part of the, the puzzle
um to really
addressing climate change. I think we
heard today that there are a lot of needs
and clim and tax credits will
of course not fix
all of the problems, but they are a
nice thing to do in
conjunction with some of the more
regulatory um approaches
that you're gonna hear about
for the rest of the day.
So uh change
lats. So these
are this the
tax credits that are in
place today in our
state right now, we have a
sustainable building tax credit.
I'll give you a little bit more detail on that
one in a minute. We also
have a solar market tax
credit um that has been renewed
quite a few times and just
last session had a
supplemental look back
that was provided by
the legislature to
make sure that folks that had put on
solar would be um
covered. We also have
quite a few more tax credits coming
soon. Um The electric
vehicle and the electric vehicle
charger um will be out
very very soon. The the
draft regulations are
out for review right now.
Um But we also have coming
on ground um on
line and ground source heat
pump, geothermal electric
generation, geothermal
electric sales and
an advanced energy tax
credit. So this is really a tool
that the state of New Mexico has used
a lot. Um We'd like to make
sure that they are fully
implemented and I think we'll see a
lot of benefit in terms of
decarbonization from these
types of tools next
next line.
So I was asked to go through
two of these in detail. So I'm
gonna go quickly through um
and then we can open it
up for questions about any of
the others. But the two that
I wanted to cover are the sustainable
building tax credit. This is one that's already
in place and then I'll talk a
little bit about the electric vehicle
tax credit that's coming online.
So the sustainable building tax
credit was updated
in 2021 thanks to
Representative Ortez.
Um and this really
um is a, it's a brand new
kind of tax credit for
the state of New Mexico. We've had
it in place for quite some time that
covered um new
buildings. So
for new homes, new
commercial buildings, but
starting in 2021
we are also covering
upgrades to existing
buildings and existing homes
and that was a really
nice um
addition to this tax
credit. So it has
annual caps for each building
type. It is
double for
low income applicants and
affordable housing, something that we
think is very important
and it is refundable
for low income, New
Mexicans and for affording
affordable housing development.
So again, we'll get into why we
think those are important, but that's the
basis for the sustainable
building tax credit. Next
slide. Um
So in the new
2021 credit,
the new
commercial and residential
buildings have to meet
kind of high lead
standards. So they have to be
built to the, you know, the latest
and greatest in terms of energy
conservation. But
they also include
um baselines that I think are
really important uh to
get this tax credit, the building
that you're building has to be ev
ready and it has
to have broadband access.
And so this was a way to make sure that
we were building buildings that were
really um thinking
forward and and ready for the
future. And there were
additional bumps in there if
you are um building a
net zero home
or um an all
electric home. So if
you're a builder and you're building those
types of buildings, you get an
additional per square
foot amount of that
tax credit. Next
slide.
And then the
groundbreaking part of this was
the addition of the existing
building uh upgrades
and I won't go into all these
details. You have them on the slide,
they're on the energy and minerals
website. But basically,
if you have an existing building,
whether it be a residential or small
commercial, you
now can get a
tax credit for getting
better windows, better
insulation, better
doors, putting
in a heat pump,
water heater or
a heat pump or
making your home ev
ready. And so these are
really um individual
items that are, that were
meant to make it much easier for
folks to do one
thing and get that tax credit
to incentivize them
to increase their
efficiency in their house.
So next
slide, I'll
move on to the electric
vehicle tax credit. Now, this
is new this year, we
don't have the rulemaking finished
quite yet, but as I said, the
rules are out for comment right
now. Um, kept
thinking I might be able to slide
them in before this meeting, but
they are out. So, um,
this tax credit will be
available for new
vehicles that are
priced $55,000
or less are used
vehicles that are at
$25,000 or less.
And so this was the unique
way that the
legislature um
ensured that these are not going
for, you know, folks that are
buying really fancy fancy
new cars um but
including those used vehicles
because I like
most New Mexicans I know,
have never purchased a new car
and probably never will. But
it's really nice that I'm able to
participate in the EV tax
credit and, and really
help, help me buy down
that cost of that new
car. So for
this tax credit and
this is really nice. There is no
cap uh it is
refundable, it is
transferable and
it sunsets in 2029.
And if you go to the next slide, you'll
see basically
in a there's a lot of
step downs. Um But
to start with that, you get an
amount per um new
electric vehicle, a
new plug-in and
then we go down from there for
used and then use
plug-in and those amounts
decrease over time as
we see more and more electric
vehicles in our
market next
slide.
So I wanted to just
really quickly talk about
what we see as
ways to make tax
credits, whichever
kind you're talking about
um really more effective
as a decarbonization tool.
And I think the first thing for
me is that we should be
thinking about ways to make
these tax credits cover the
incremental cost for low income,
New Mexicans of whatever
the technology is that we're trying
to incentivize folks to take
on. So, uh
we talked about in the sustainable
building tax credit, we
double the amounts
of all of those
tax credits for low income
folks. So that really gets
us to basically
covering full incremental
cost for low income New Mexicans.
And I think that's a really important thing
to think through when you're
designing a decarbonization
tool, like a tax
credit. The
next thing that we would encourage
is much like we did on the
EV tax credit that was just passed
by this legislature. No
caps is a
really important thing to
include in the legislation. I mentioned
upfront that the solar market tax
credit, we had to kind of go
back and do a fix
because folks had
purchased and
installed uh
solar
and then found out
that there was no money
left because of the caps
and the legislature was forced
to go back in and do a, a fix
on that. And it really
is problematic for folks that
are trying to do
things like buy an electric
vehicle, put on solar
mark, solar um,
panels or even
something smaller,
um, like a heat pump, heat
pumps are very expensive and you want
to be able to count on those
dollars when you expend
those funds upfront, you want to
make sure that you're gonna have the
funds in that tax
credit to be able to pay
you back. We
think the refundable ability
and transferability are really
important. Something that
this legislature has been really,
really good about making sure
that specifically for
low-income folks, if
they do this and they qualify
for the tax credit, um,
they can and they don't have a
tax liability,
they can get that refunded to
them when their, when their taxes
come due. So that is a really important
thing, but it's not perfect
because what it still says is
that if you're low income and
you go by, say an
electric vehicle, now,
um, you have to wait until next
year when you do
your taxes, uh, to
get that refund
back. And that is
great for some folks who
can afford that weight.
But it is certainly
not every
New Mexican that can
have, you know, a
69, 12
month delay in getting those
funds back. So
one thing that we've, that lots
of folks are talking about and we would
love to, um, think
through with the legislature is a
possibility of
finding some way to
make these types of
credits more of a
rebate as other
states have done. Uh We
refer to it as cash on the hood,
which is great for the evs, but it's
also all the other expenses.
It would be great if, when you
purchase it, you can
get those funds
immediately. I know that there
are issues with that under our
anti donation clause, but other
states have figured this out and it
really does improve
the accessibility uh
for low income
people in particular to be
able to participate in these new
markets and do things
like fix up their home under the
sustainable building tax credit
or buy a used V
under the new tax credit that's
forthcoming.
Um
Couple of more things, one
rule makings, we really just
think that rulemaking should
be um a much
more streamlined process that
they should happen as soon as the bill
is passed. What we
see is a bill passes
like this year, we, we saw
the EV tax credit pass.
Um Folks got really excited
but they can't really qualify
for it for a while.
Um And the delay sometimes
does make folks forget
about this option
and then we would really
encourage that rule makings
be as simple
and easy as possible.
I think we sometimes
hurt ourselves by taking
the legislation that is
created by this body
and making it somewhat more
difficult to understand
and implement. I
will tell the story of a colleague
of mine who works for a living
on heat pump and
decarbonization
um and he
purchased a heat pump and installed
it and did not qualify for
the tax credit because it was a
little difficult. Um, and
so making these things
very, very straightforward.
If you do what's in the bill
you get, the tax credit
is really important.
Um, and then lastly, and
I know this sounds kind of obvious,
but, um,
tax credits are only as
good as
how many people know about
them. And so
we just think public education is
the key and I know
our um ec MD
office is doing
500 things at a time
and they're doing them all very well.
Uh But for this legislature
to know that having additional
staffing and support
at uh the
energy office would be extremely
helpful in getting the
word out to people
about these tax credits.
So that with this, the full
incentivized um
tax credit could be
used by everyone in our
state, not just those that are
in the know. So >> thank
>> you.
>> Ok, thank you very
much. Next. We're gonna go to Michael
Bueno, the Environmental
Defense Fund who
I hope is
available via
Zoom.
>> I am here. Can you hear me?
>> Yes,
>> great. Um
Thank you. It's really enable
the sharing option on
Zoom. I'm able to share on slides
at the moment. >> So I think
we're advancing the slides for
the speakers. Is, is that right
to
because
can you see your
slide,
Michael?
We got the first slide up.
>> Ok, great.
Uh Hi, everybody. Uh
Mr chair I representative of the
committee. I thank you for the opportunity
to speak to you all. Um
Although remotely, I'm sorry that I can't be
the wrong person. Uh My name is Michael
Bueno. I am a senior manager
for State Climate Policy and strategy
with environmental Defense Fund.
And today I'll be covering
opportunities to achieve
new Mexico's climate
ambitions.
Excellent,
please.
Uh Last time we spoke
to you, my colleague, Goo
participated and presented
at the Nar's Interim Committee
meeting in October
of last year. At that
meeting, he discussed
E DS analysis
that we had just
published on the
emissions gap and
trajectory for
um New Mexico's emissions
and the role of the power sector in reducing
emissions. Um
And what you can see here is
essentially a graph from that
analysis that provides a summary
of where New
Mexico's past emissions are
relative to what we
project emissions will
be in the future.
And it establishes a quick
outline of the different
reduction goals that New
Mexico um
has basically committed to
including the
2019
executive order by uh
Governor Lujan Grisham of 45%
reductions by 23
and also two
targets um
of 26% by
2025 and 50%
reduction by
2030. Uh
since New Mexico is also
part of the U Climate
Alliance, which has those goals in
mind. What
our analysis found was
that New Mexico
uh will not
achieve the 2025
reduction. Indeed,
it will reduce emissions by only
about 1%
compared to uh
baseline
and will also not
achieve the 2030 target.
And it will only achieve about
13% emissions
reduction uh by
2030. Uh So there
is a significant gap
that needs to be made up
in that time.
And so where are we now? What has
happened since we last
presented to you? Well, uh
there's been a number of
important state and federal
actions that have
advanced uh
both clean energy and
broader uh climate initiatives
that will help reduce emissions
and potentially get the state on
track. Um As you
well know, a state action in the most
recent session. Um
And uh through the
Heat Environmental Improvement
Board, uh
advanced clean cars
uh was
um adopted,
there's been the adoption of clean
transportation fuel standard,
a number of tax credits
and incentives for clean energy tech,
of which Taman covered
a number of them. And also
the passage of the Inne Match Fund,
which is important for
uh helping communities and
eligible entities access
federal dollars
uh that are available to
them, but um are
harder to get without matching
funds. And at
the federal level, uh there
is, there was a finalization
of three important rules.
Uh One, the methane
rule which will reduce,
which aims to reduce methane
emissions from oil and
gas um
protection and activities
specifically on the well
patch. I
mean, not the oil patch pardon
me? Um and
also carbon pollution standards
for power plants and
new set of emission
standards for light and medium
duty vehicles.
Um As unfortunately,
though these are significant
wins for uh climate
and environmental policy,
there still needs to be additional
policy in order to get
the state to have on track and to help
close that emissions gap in
the long run.
And as you have
heard from a number of people today,
the opportunity to act is
now um and
for a, a number of reasons,
but to uh of which I'll highlight
here,
uh
uh Next slide are
um uh New
Mexicans want climate
action. Um
Edf action
uh did a
poll in
2022
that found that six in
10, New Mexicans support
aggressive new state climate
change policy. So
New Mexicans really
do want state
leaders to act on climate
and to help mitigate
the uh threats
that they are facing today
and also into the future.
And um as has been
mentioned earlier and
indeed in this panel as well. Uh
There are additional federal
dollars out there to make climate
action much cheaper.
The Inflation Reduction Act
itself invests
around $400
billion primarily in the
form of uncapped tax
credits to
uh investment in clean
energy technologies. There
are also a number of federal grants and
loan programs available
to dear for decarbonization
projects and technology
demonstration.
And what
would happen is that
state policies that accelerate
the transition to clean energy
can actually lead
to more federal
investment in those states. So
states that actually
take um
an ambitious
uh uh
an ambitious strategy to acting
on climate change either through
high tech RP
standards or implementing
uh other emissions reduction
programs can actually
make themselves more competitive
for accessing these
dollars.
Next life
was
um And to provide
just a little bit of an illustration of
what this means. Um
Environmental Defense Fund
commissioned the rodent
group to analyze
emissions and energy systems
impact of what it would
be like if uh
specific states speci
uh states um
of the US Climate
Alliance were to
achieve through a greenhouse reduction
of goals um
especially as being
consistent with the
uh US S
commitment to reduce
50% and uh
50% of emissions
by 2030 as part
of the Paris Climate
Accord. Um
So, on this side,
you see a graph of
what we have been able
to analyze as the potential
cumulative total
federal tax mangers
or clean energy credits
in two scenarios.
One in which
um a state
takes no action
on climate um
and also has no
additional investments. Thanks
to the Inflation Reduction Act
and another in which
a US Climate Action
state actually
uh implements uh a
stronger climate
policy with
the addition of
uh federal dollars and
support. And what you can
see highlighted here is
that in both
narratives uh and
the scenario case in which
New Mexico actually adds
um to
uh a more ambitious climate
policy, you,
the state has the opportunity to access
4 billion
in additional investment
from climate action. Thanks
to the Inflation Reduction Act of
being in place. So that's
a significant amount of
money just by
uh putting forward more ambitious
climate policy that New Mexico
can achieve
next like
this.
And to illustrate this
factor, we know what that may
look like for
residents
in New Mexico and
households.
Um This slide
shows what the
average household energy
expenditures and
what we project it to be
in 23 may be
in two different scenarios,
one in which the state takes
action um
with uh Ira investments
in one in a sort of
business as usual case.
Um And as you
can see here in New Mexico,
you there is the
opportunity for
households to save
uh upwards of a little over
$600 in estimated
uh annual costs
from uh energy
expenditures um
from electricity usage,
uh home energy heating
and even mobility
uh from uh
additional climate
policy that would help
incentivize
um the
deployment of clean energy
technologies. So
at the household level
acting onhe really
can save people money.
Next slide,
please.
So in summary, we know what's
the bottom line uh for New
Mexicans? Um you
know, New Mexicans support aggressive
state climate change policy. As
I noted earlier, uh
climate actions like clean energy
deployments are
essentially on sale
thanks to federal investments that
actually buy down the cost of
cutting climate pollution.
Um So it's an important
opportunity to act on these investments
now
and those federal
investments are critical.
Unfortunately, they're
not
totally sufficient for
New Mexico or the nation
to achieve its climate goals
um or to ensure a
safer climate.
Um the
graph that you see on the
right hand side shows
what a
um if all
climate leadership
states acted
um and set
ambitious targets for reducing
climate emissions,
we could all
those states together could
reduce uh
emissions by up to 40
48% and close
the sort of emissions gap at the national
level. So it help get the
United States much
closer to the goal um
and its commitments as part of the
Paris Climate Agreement.
So states will play a central
role in in
the us achieving these
goals next
license.
So what can uh New
Mexico's New Mexico
do? Uh what can
elected leaders do in
this space?
Um First and
foremost, you can codify
a statutory
greenhouse gas reduction
target. Um
So basically putting the targets
that were set up
by the
governor's executive order
um to be
in line with the private science and
be put into law.
So 50%
below 25 levels by
2030 75%
by 2040 mid
zero, by 2050.
Um and have an
established interim target to
basically keep emissions reductions
on a jam uh downward
trajectory uh to
ensure that we're reducing
emissions uh
every year. And not
just say
uh down the
line uh because every
ton of emissions in the
atmosphere uh
leads to
um warming at, at a
faster rate.
And this also will help prevent
backsliding on
climate progress if you have
these reduction targets set into
law, that means
that you have to
implement policy to achieve them.
Um And so the change
of uh a governorship
administration
um or the revoking of
executive order will
ensure that uh
there won't be backsliding
in that process.
Um It's also important
to provide authority to
agencies and basically
fund them to act. Uh
So in the instances where
there isn't necessarily
parity in statute
of, if a state
agencies can actually regulate
greenhouse gas emissions.
Um It,
it's important to provide that clarity
and to give them in existing
authorities and to give them the directive
to adopt policies to meet these
targets. Um
As you've heard
already, um not only
on this panel but on previous
panels, it's important to fully
fund state regulatory
agencies and ensure that
they have the sufficient resources
to basically effectively
implement these policies.
It does take a lot
of uh people power
in order to
stand up these
uh regulatory programs
and to ensure and to ensure
that um
the targeted sectors
are meeting those
reductions. Um
And this is basically an aim to
create a whole government
approach for uh
climate change.
Next,
please.
Uh Additionally,
equity and environmental justice
considerations are really
key to the
success of this
uh type of effort
um specifically
in attempting to prioritize
benefits for
low income and disadvantaged
communities who
tend to bear the brunt
of environmental
injustices. Uh
not only from
uh pollution but also
from climate change, they
are vulnerable
communities. Uh So
it is necessary to
obligate regulators to pursue
emissions reductions in these
communities specifically.
Uh because studies
have shown that a number
of uh
stationary emission
sources are co
located in low income
and disadvantaged communities.
Um So,
by
pursuing emissions reductions in
those areas, you are actually
cutting emissions and
aiding uh these
communities uh and
relieving them of potential pollution
burden.
Um And
as what the federal government is
doing, it also directing
state and federal investments to
ensure adjusting equitable
energy transition.
Um
And secondly, it's important
to create an equitable process for
consultation and engagement
um in our
communities
uh
know essentially
what they want and what's
best for them. So it's
important to have consistent
consultation
um um and
engagement with all
communities impacted communities and
tribal communities in the
development of
uh private policy and,
and, and, and in its
implementation.
Uh The next slide,
please
also just to sum up, you know, what's
in for New Mexicans.
Um You know, this is a
real opportunity to
mitigate the real
and present
uh the real present and future
impacts of climate change,
of which you've heard a number of them
already from
uh wildfires to
droughts uh to
flooding. Um
This provides relief to
vulnerable uh and
frontline communities by reducing
pollution uh from
allocated emission
sources.
Um As I noted
earlier, it can help create
new economic opportunities
by spurring market demand
for the entry projects and
technologies and help drive
investment uh
and federal and dollars from
both federal and private actors
into the state.
And also it can improve
the durability of
the climate progress that New
Mexico has already made.
Uh There have been a number of advances
in the policies that the state has
implemented. Um
So we want to ensure
that the achievements that
uh you've already made
in reducing climate pollution
uh continue into the
future, especially in the
face of political
policy, uh
political and
uh uh policy
uncertainty. Um as
you're well aware, you know, the Supreme
Court struck down a
number of
um sort
of uh the
policies that enabled
the federal government to
hopefully regulate
various sources of pollution.
So in the face of the uncertainty,
states will be the
frontline in terms
of uh
achieving our
climate.
Thanks and that's
all I have for you. Thank
you.
>> Thank you for that.
Um
Before I go to the committee, I had a couple
of questions for clarification.
Um
Mr o'connell,
uh you talked to, you
said we're basically on track
to meet the RPS
standards. Uh Mr
Brandon talked about
emissions goals
uh that were done by executive order.
Aren't there emission
targets in the
ETA?
And can you tell us
whether or not we're on track
to meet those and, and
distinguish those from
the RPS
standards?
>> Yes, Mr Chair, there are
emission targets
uh gets
confusing when you ask ETA
because some people still refer
to the whole thing as the ETA
there's emission targets in two
places. There's a
an emissions target that applies
directly to PNM.
That's in the Energy Transition
Act because they asked for
securitization at
San Juan.
They are currently not
meeting that emission
target commission
is in the process of
a rulemaking
to establish
clearly how the
emissions get calculated
against that target and, and
what consequences
will be? Should they
fail to continue to not
meet that target? The
other target is in the
Renewable Energy Act
and that's
24
I think 2045
net zero among
the uh electric
utilities. And
so that's what I was
alluding to in my
piece about technology.
Uh The last
ratchet on rps is
80% and then
next step is zero.
And so, uh
getting to where we
are is
we're gonna need different things to
get to there than what we needed to
get to here. So right now
it's reduced
uh emissions
by adding wind and
solar. When
we get to
something that's closer to
zero, we're gonna need a more
diverse base of
technology to,
to get that done. So
that kind of things
like I recognize
the legislature for pursuing
things like geothermal.
The kind of thing that the commission
is working on is
improving access
to better electric
markets across the region.
New Mexico is blessed
with cheapest
wind and solar probably could
have some of the cheapest
geo geothermal also
in the West. So
if we can
uh export
those resources,
then it will help
with lowering the cost
for New Mexicans as we get that
done and create other options
for how to keep it
reliable while we're
hitting that
target.
>> So,
so the, the RPS,
the renewable portfolio
standards is
about adding
uh other types of energy to
the mix and the
eta is
about um
emissions target. So it's sort
of two
different ends of the of the
pipeline if you will.
And we're doing better on
adding
other types of energy to the mix
than we are at
reducing
the emissions. Is that
correct? >> That's
correct. I don't want
to give the
impression that emissions
aren't reducing. They just haven't
gotten to the 400
level, 400 pounds
per megawatt level
that is in the eta
for any utility that used
securitization.
Uh And one of the wrinkles
in that was uh P
and M decided to reduce
the amount of capacity it had
at a nuclear plant. So
they had some zero
emissions that got replaced
with a mix of
renewable and
fossil fuel. So they
didn't hit the target the way they
had projected
>> and on the emission
targets. What's
the enforcement
mechanism?
>> Mr Chair right now,
enforcement mechanism
is just Public Utility
Act. One of
the things that the commission
has been doing
is getting
better at providing
notice that when you
break the rules and break
the laws, you will face a
penalty. Uh
Previously,
the commission would run
into situations
where they wanted to penalize
somebody but hadn't given that
notice. And then
it ended up being an
arbitrary act and,
and wasn't with
standing up to court.
So we do have authority
within Public Utility Act. It's
very broad, very
wide range of numbers. So
getting a little more focused
on, here's the rule,
here's how you're going to meet it and
here's the consequences
is what we're working
on in our current rulemaking
so that we can be more
effective
in communicating
consequences. >> And
when Mr Bueno talked
about um
statutory targets
with that.
Is that something you would anticipate
would also be enforceable under
the Public Utility
Act,
>> Mr Chair? I believe
so. I also think
his targets were
economy wide.
So
Public Utility Act
gives us authority
to enforce things
that are the utilities
that we regulate. Um,
but these targets that
Mr Bueno was talking about are
broader than that.
So I, I would say
while you're working through that,
make sure you do
have uh enforcement
authority for somebody
when you're writing that rule.
>> Ok. And I, and I appreciate
that because the
target without
enforcement
isn't as
meaningful.
>> Absolutely agree.
>> Ok. So going to the committee,
Senator Stefani,
>> thank you, Mr Chair. Uh My
question is for
Mr
o'connell
as the IOS
and the co-ops come
in front of you. How
much discussion is there
about
not having
the
um
right equipment
to upgrade the
grid, the transmission
lines, etcetera?
Uh I come into contact
with um
many people who
say I'm being
held back from
doing projects
because the
utilities at
whatever level they are
aren't accommodating. And in
fact, I was just
at somebody's
house
who has, who's
ready for a micro grid that
could power an
entire valley
and they said
the company wherever
they are, wasn't
willing or
able to
accommodate them.
So what kinds of discussion
do you have in front of the Pr
C?
>> Um Mr Chair, Senator
Stefani's
great question. I think
it pervades everything
we're doing at the PR C
right now. Uh The front
and center example of
that is
um we're
working through another rulemaking
process on the interconnection
rule. So
that is requiring
every utility
to have
a system that is able to
accommodate
new interconnections to
the system. I mean, classic
example is, is what you
just provided frankly
that somebody wants to add a
solar system to their roof.
They go to the utility, the utility
says feeders full.
Um then
they'll either say here's a
bill. You can
give me a lot of money and
I'll make a
investment in the
feeder so that you can
connect or
um this feeder is so
complicated that I don't
know the answer so you can't do
it. So, uh
broadly, the
interconnection rule
is sets new
standards for
uh how utilities
shall study those type of
things and provide plans
that get them to
a point where the grid can
accommodate uh
new connections
on the customer side of the
meter. And
I I
say that pervades everything
we do because quite a few
of frankly, the
climate strategies run through
interconnection, right?
So we
heard a lot today
about transportation
electrification
that involves people
installing new chargers on
the distribution
system
um
in upgrading
buildings. Uh Then
you could also get to a
situation where you've added heat
pumps and you've added the load to
your building and you
could run into that same
barrier
on from
the utility.
And then what I was talking
about earlier about supply
chain challenges. When we're saying
interconnection, there's a little
I interconnection and that's
the the distribution
grid. The big I interconnection
is also an issue.
Utilities
are struggling
with connecting large
generators and large
loads. Um
Part of that is just
generational inflection
point. You know, we've gone for
30 years where
electric system was kind of boring.
The load wasn't growing,
the generation mix wasn't
changing.
Uh We've changed
that due to technology
advancements, you know, wind and solar
are now among the least expensive
things you can do. So
folks are wanting to add
that for economic reasons.
Meanwhile, we also
decided to grow the load.
So we're
encouraging as a
climate strategy to
use more electricity for
everybody. All
that happened
at the time that
the global supply
chain collapsed. So
we're kind of at a painful
moment now, but
things are, are showing
signs of life and picking
up. And so you're
you able to
buy transformers, it might
just take you a year or two longer
than you thought I was gonna take.
Uh Those are the kind of things that
we're working through right now
and getting back to being
on it in terms of
making this
transition.
>> Uh One final
comment and question,
you know, many people in
the um who have,
who own rural property
don't look at rooftop,
they put out panels
and fields and they,
they maybe put out too
many and
want to share it with their
neighbors or with a
whole little community.
So that's one thing
that we need to keep in mind as we
plan for the future. The
secondly, secondly,
if an in an
individual
is having
problem,
a problem or
many problems with a
utility in terms of
bringing up
their system hooking
in. Do
you have somebody in your
shop that handles
uh these complaints or
queries?
>> Mr Chair Senator
Stans. Yes,
there is a series of rules
that govern how
these utilities interact
with their customers.
Uh If
something happens that runs afoul
of the rules, we have a
consumer relations
division that is,
is I'm very proud
of and, and they're very
responsive and then if
things balloon too bigger
than that division can handle
it, it comes in front of the
commission.
>> Thank you. That's all Mister
Sher.
>> Thank you, Senator Senator
Woods.
Thank you, Mr
chair,
Chairman o'connell.
How much is electricity gone
up? How
much has electrical rates
gone up since
we passed the
ETA
>> uh chairman mcqueen,
Senator Woods. Uh there's
a recent study
out from energy insight
that looks at
uh electric
rate growth across the
country. And
the good news in New Mexico
is while costs
have gone up, um,
they have kept
in line with inflation and
actually a little bit less than
inflation and, and that makes you
New Mexico
Unique um
Other states uh
don't have that similar
experience. And one of the reasons
that's happening in New Mexico
is as
these laws have passed,
it also coincided with
the time that wind and solar
became
uh low cost
resources. So,
so far we have uh
kept cost
increases in line with inflation.
So that's around
22.3
2.5%.
>> OK. And, and my
next question is
as we go to a
total electric
transportation
industry,
what are we expecting the electric
rates to do?
>> Uh Mr Chair, Senator
Wood. Uh
certainly when we build new
things, there are costs
associated with that.
So the cost side of the
equation is going up,
but we're also talking about an
environment where we're
also increasing sales.
Uh So the impact
on rates uh
won't be as acute
as the impact on costs.
So uh
that's
part of what attracted me to the
job I have now is trying
to make sure when we are building
things, uh we're
extracting as much benefit
from each thing as possible.
So if, if we're building,
make, making an
improvement, we're, we're solving
two or three problems with that
improvement. Uh
looking to things like
regional markets. So that as
we're adding new generation,
we also have
better markets for
places to sell.
So I can't promise
you rates aren't going
up. Uh What I can
promise you is we're working
to ensure that
uh new
Mexicans benefit from
the situation we're in while
we're making these investments
and keeping
the rate increases
as low as possible.
And then as you heard
today, there's tremendous value
in electricity, maybe
more than there used
to be when you're looking
at uh it as a
feature of fighting climate
change. >> So,
so Mr
chair uh
chairman,
there has been no
studies to
done
so that we have an idea of
what the electric rates will
do.
You're saying we're gonna have more
customers,
therefore,
our
maybe our residential
rates will stay down
or explain
what you meant by that.
>> Yeah, Mr
Chair, Senator Wood, I am
not
in possession of a study
saying here's the rate path for
the next five or 10 years in New
Mexico. Yeah, so I agree with
you. That study has not been
done.
>> Ok?
I I always
am interested when we start
talking about
tax
credits
and I even Google tax
credit just so I would
be
in the tune here, Mr
Chair. Now,
Google's never
wrong,
but essentially it says the
tax
credit
is a repayment
on your taxes
due or
a deduction of your taxes
due unless it's a
refundable credit.
Then it means a
credit, you can
put it down on your
tax
uh income tax
statement and you
will get repaid this
cash repayment.
And I think that's pretty
well my
understanding and I think
that's the understanding.
Uh Tammy is kind
of what, what we
consider tax credit
is,
>> um, Mr Chair,
Senator Woods. Yes,
that is what a tax credit
is. Um, the only
addition I would say is in a
lot of our tax credits in New
Mexico, they are transferable
and so you can transfer
to someone else and they could
claim that credit, um,
when they do their
taxes
>> and why I get
this,
all the tax credits assume
we're gonna have revenue coming
in to pay
them
state
revenue.
And so what
revenue stream do you see
coming in as
we move away
from the fossil fuels
and coming in
to more of an
electrical,
uh,
society,
what, what revenue
comes into the state to pay
these tax credits
at that point in
time.
>> Um,
Chair mcqueen, Senator
Woods. So the tax credits
right now are paid out
of, um, the revenue
that comes in from state
from individual and corporation
taxes. And so it's all
into the general fund,
um, the tax
liability on
any of these tax credits we've talked about
have been kind of disclosed in the
F IRS that were presented
to the legislature.
But again, it's,
it's, it's really just
reducing somebody's
tax, um, liability.
So it just means that they're
paying in less
than they would have
been.
>> Essentially, it's a, it's
a transfer of wealth
from someone that's paying
taxes in
to someone that gets
to take a
credit
for their
actions. Would
that be more
or less what we're talking
about?
>> Uh, Chair mcqueen?
Senator Woods, I, I
would say it is a way
to incentivize folks
to do something that we see a societal
good for, by allowing
them to pay less
taxes.
>> It's, it's an
incentive.
It's an incentive. I
understand what you're saying.
It's, we decided that
it's to the public's
interest that they
do something and we
incentivize it just like
building a better building,
uh, much like
building a fireproof
building or
right, sizing
school houses.
Uh I
understand all
that,
but I also understand
where our current revenues
come
from.
And that's
the part that has
got me
thinking about this
Mr Chair. Next
time this comes up with tax
credits, let's have
someone representing the
tax and revenue department
here also.
Thank you,
sir.
>> Thank you, Senator. Uh
um
So just for
the record, the
topic of this panel
strategies to mitigate climate
change. It's not really a tax credit
panel.
Um
But thank
you for your suggestion.
Uh Next step, we have
Representative Kates.
>> Thank you, chair. Um
And, and thank you for your
presentation. If we
can go back and remember
all the very smart
questions our chair
asked,
um,
from,
I'm so sorry, Mr
mcconnell
o'connell.
So he asked what the
audit process was and
you talked about increasing
penalties.
Um But what I
want, I want to
know,
how are you
identifying
individuals who are not
in compliance
such as is it
only
reporting. Uh
Do we, do we
have uh
compliance
auditors in the
field? How
often are we going
there? Um
And, and where are they
specifically going?
Thanks,
>> Mr Chairman Representative
Kates. I'm in a
fortunate position that I
regulate three
investor owned utilities.
So that
is easier for me than it
might be for uh some
of the other state agencies
that have a very diffuse
uh
regulatory interests.
So anyway, uh things
like this eta
standard, it only applies
to one utility.
It's big
numbers. So we're
just trying to
agree on the formula,
you know, which
emissions are easy to
quantify.
Sales may be
easy to quantify. So just
working through agreement
on what you put numerator, what you
put in the denominator, then we'll have
the number. It'll be easy to
audit and
we'll be rocking and
rolling. And >> is that data
provided to you annually?
Monthly, quarterly?
>> That's one of the questions
in the rule making, right? So the
law says 400
pounds per megawatt
hour. So, is that
an hour, uh is
it a year, is it,
you know that there's
actually some disagreement
on and then
the utility will submit
a report saying whether they're in
compliance or not on?
I think it's an every three year
basis. So they're arguing they
can average over three years.
So we've got that full range of
opinions in front of us.
That's the point of the rule making
to get it down to, here's a formula
we agree on and
let's go.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. I
just for
clarification sake. This
is what I'm hearing. Let
me know if I'm doing this wrong, I'm
hearing wrong
is
you
are confirming
compliance
by,
by
documents
usage emissions
that could be provided
to you only on
a three year basis
but is not
clear in the
rulemaking how often
they have to provide you with that
data to ensure
that they are compliant. Is,
is that what I
heard, >> Mr
Chair representative, I'm
sorry, if that's the
impression I
left
the information is measured
on an hourly
basis.
You know, emissions are
reported to EPA
on an hourly basis
and then sales
can be sliced and diced
on a monthly basis,
probably
with accuracy,
certainly on an annual
basis, certainly on a three
year basis. So,
>> thank you. No, I did. I didn't
understand hourly. I was wondering,
when do you get that
information? But,
but I, I, I'll move on.
I, I don't want, I don't want to use the
committee's, uh,
uh,
time. I have
one other. So
because I wasn't quite
sure and I'm so sorry, but
I wasn't quite sure
if I understood,
um,
uh,
misfile corn, I
believe, uh,
answer on the
taxes.
So the tax
credits that you've been talking
about, they're tax credits. If I
owe taxes, I get a
credit, they're not on
tax refundable
credits
where I
get to
write in. So they,
they are only really eligible
for people
who
owe taxes.
Correct,
>> Mr Chair Representative.
Um that is the case in
most instances, there
are a few of the various
tax credits that are refundable.
For example, the sustainable
building tax credit is refundable
for low-income
folks um are
for affordable housing
development. And so there
are certain
situations where they
are refundable
um
based on the legislation that
approved them. >> Thank
you so much and thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, Representative
Gates for getting a little short on time.
We have two people on the list.
Representative Armstrong,
>> thank you, Mr Chairman and thank you
for your presentation.
Uh Mr Parks first, I'd like
to thank you for recognizing
that there's a difference in rural New
Mexico than urban
uh with our school systems.
Um I really do appreciate
that uh a lot
of times
uh with
the, as far as say
solar goes,
the, the grid doesn't
have the capacity
and, and so we're, we're
selling solar
loud and proud.
At the same time, a lot
of entities don't have the
capacity.
So the the grid does
not have the capacity to,
to sell the solar back.
So I just appreciate
that so much. And, and in the
meantime, while if we're looking
at schools that
we're gonna, we're building new schools and
we're doing this new
uh the, the
anything new
as far as infrastructure
goes, it's gonna drive the cost
of the school building up
as a Legislative
finance committee complains all the
time that the cost is
gone three
times now.
So, you know, people,
I just want people to recognize
that that's gonna happen.
Um As far
as uh
rulemaking,
I think the majority of us over here
would, would agree with your
rulemaking. Um
suggestion that
there's a lot of problems in
rulemaking.
Uh The 180 day
mandate for schools
is one of them rulemaking.
Uh The ev mandate for
uh automobile
makers are manufacturers
rulemaking. Uh
So I would agree with that.
A heat pump has taken two
years to get Mr Chairman
for anybody building a new
house.
So it's
a problem. It's an issue.
Um The reason
that we have caps
is because we have to
budget
in the budgeting process, we have
so much taxes coming
in and
if we don't, if we just
leave it capless,
there's an issue.
Uh the dyed diesel
that was just passed, there's a
cap,
there's a cap on that. And so if
we don't put a cap, then we
can't budget at the
state level
for uh
for the state of New
Mexico.
Um
I don't really have a question
but I, I find it a
little bit um
insulting the last
presenter
uh that he got
political.
He had a political
statement up on his
slide, we don't have copies
of it.
And uh if
we're here to work
and to do something good for New
Mexico, that's the last
thing that we want to see
is getting
political. Let's sit
down at a table and have a
conversation and do our
best for the State of New
Mexico.
And yeah, we
are, we are a
political,
we are political but I
really dislike
it. and I think it's disres
disrespectful
for a presenter to get
political.
Thank you, Mr
Chairman
>> Representative Lujan.
>> Thank you. Um I'll
build on some of
what um
Representative Marang said.
Um uh
I agree with her on some of the things she
said the rulemaking to be
more streamlined. Thank you, Tammy
for bringing that up. I think that's really
important. I'd like to see what we can move on
that and, you know, as one of
the uh sponsors
for
um for the sustainable
building uh tax code myself.
I, I find that I've been trying
to spread the word myself, so
it's hard. Um
And so
I'd like to figure out a way
of us getting that information out
more, uh maybe working
with the ta with our
tax department, but we can talk
more about that. So thank you for bringing that
up. Um
I'd like to ask
the, the PR C, I'm gonna
get a little bit just uh
grounded in,
maybe uh talking a little
bit as we're talking about the
rates in and
the potential for the rates to go
up because of, of costs
of, of,
of our policies
if you will.
Um But we've been
able to um
regulate those really
well. So I want to thank the PR C for
the work and I'd like to, uh some
of the comments are saying that we need to
fully uh
staff that agency.
I couldn't agree more. I think this is a
really important thing we need to be
talking about.
Um But in regards to the
RT O which
is a regional uh
uh transmission
operation, can you give
us an update of where we are
conversations about an
RT O for the Western
States? Mr
>> Chair, Mr,
chair, Representative
Lujan, certainly
there's
two
organizations that would
like to provide the
RT O service to the
West. And so they're
both uh
I'll say in competition with each
other to make their best
offer. Uh So
one is, is the
Southwest Power Pool, they
have offered
quite a few services to the
West, very
valuable services like
uh rap, you know, Western
Resource Adequacy
program.
Um They're offering
markets plus which is a
day ahead market.
Uh They're also
offering RT O West
and, and there are some
utilities north of here
in Colorado who are joining
that. So they'll be joining
uh RT O
that's run by Southwest Power
Pool. Uh There's
another initiative that, that
frankly, I helped initiate
called pathways initiative
and that was concept
that what PP
offers likely won't
include California
uh for
customers across the
west, I think will
benefit if we
can get the broadest
possible footprint. So
there's more diversity
in the market. So there are more
opportunities to,
to buy and sell
cheaply or, you know, sell
to the best markets and buy at the
cheapest prices. So anyway,
that is working its
way through a
large stakeholder
process and, and it will likely
involve uh
action at the California
legislature before it
can exist. So
uh stay tuned quite
a bit is happening. I'd say
the soonest you could get
to a RT O that
encompasses a, a big
swath of the West
will be
uh
realistically
3 to 5 years from
now. >> That,
that, that that would be,
would have been my follow up question that
timeline. I really appreciate that.
And then my last question is going to go to uh
Puck. Thank you for being here.
Um And telling us about
where we are with the
climate change
uh
bureau. I think you mentioned the
Policy Bureau that you've
been creating all the different factors
of it and where, where we
are. It's a little,
a little confusing to where all
the, all the pieces and all the parts
and how everything is, is
running. So my,
my question is, how are
you um do you have
any legislator, legislative
engagement or anybody,
you know, ad hoc
or
um any legislators
working with you in, in
the, in the executive
Mr Chair?
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and
Representative Lujan,
not directly at the
moment. Uh What we're
taking is a concentric
approach. Meaning
we're to start with ourselves,
meaning start with state agencies and
state government and
support each agency
in adapting to climate change.
Whether that means for example,
helping our corrections
facilities
have air
conditioning, for example, for the
heat that's coming or helping
electrify the state fleet.
And then we're planning to use the
lessons learned from each of those
26 agencies
um to then
concentric circle out
to other cities,
municipalities,
schools and other entities from
there. >> Great. That,
that, that was, that was good that
I I followed you there. That's,
that's great. Um Thank you for
that update there. It's just
that we um
as we're, we're centralized
and we're having this bigger conversation
around climate change and
policy specifically,
I'm just kind of, you know, going
into the, the place of, of
policy when you said you,
we've done some of the biggest
policy initiatives already
for this administration.
Um What is
on the forefront
for this next 60 day session?
If at all, you can comment Mr
Chair,
>> Mr Chair Representative Lujan.
I apologize. I'm not quite
sure. I understand the question. >> I'm
sorry, Mr Chair, I
wasn't clear but if
what are, what are the agencies
or the groups that are working
on policy,
climate policy
for the executive,
what are you focusing on
now or talking about
for the next 60 day session? If
you're able to talk about. Thank
>> you, Chair
Representative Lujan. What we're
working on actually is concrete
action. Um Right
now, we the policy is
in a good place.
And so for example, those items
that I mentioned, for example, working with
Corrections or Department of
Transportation or for example,
aging and long term services on
how to prepare for the heat that's going
to impact New Mexico seniors.
And what that physically means
they need to do with their buildings.
Uh We're using ourselves
as the model to experiment
with and learn from
pulling in all
of the tools that are available right
now. So some of the tax
um or sorry, some of the state
resources, for example,
there's a lot of resources
coming from the federal level, there's
grants selective pay
and using ourselves as
a laboratory to learn how to
physically make changes on the
ground for what New Mexico
needs. Um With the
hope that again, those lessons
learned can be extended
outwards in terms of
where the policy is right now. I
I think we're in a good place.
We have what we need um
potentially, but there's always
room for discussion. Of course.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. I do believe
I'm a pro we, we, we
are, we're in a good
place, so to speak, but
there we are way
behind in a lot of
areas and I'd like to see how we can
expand. Thank you Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, representative. We
are uh over time,
but we have Representative Scott
briefly and with no
math
questions.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman Mr
o'connell. I believe I heard you
say
that residential utility
rates were
going up at about the rate of
inflation. But
current average at
state level, I believe
is about 14.5
cents
14.35
years ago is a little over a
dime.
So,
do you have any
predictions as
to what tra
trajectory
of those
residential rates are gonna
be or the? And
will they continue on
the path
that they seem to have been
on for the last
few years?
>> Uh Mr Chair Representative
Scott, I, I do not have
a projection for
future rates.
Uh The position I'm
in, I
receive rate
requests and
try to make sure that they're
as low as possible, but
I'm not predicting what
they're going to be going
forward.
>> Mr Chairman Mr,
do, do you know
of anyone
that is making projections
of that
nature?
>> Uh Mr Chair Representative
Scott, I'm sitting here to
just try to think through
and you do
see
projections
on a national level,
but I don't have anything that's
granular to
be on point with your
question.
>> Uh Mr Chairman
Mr K, thank you for
that. And then one
more with respect to electric
vehicles, can
someone tell me what the market
penetration
for electric vehicle sales
in New Mexico is
now
>> uh Mr Chair
Representative Scott. I
can't give you the specific
number. I can tell
you that recently,
uh a few of the utilities
came through the PR C with
their transportation
electrification plans.
And there the conversation
was around the thing they called the S
curve. So not
sure if that's actually math or
not, but I, I think it
actually is. But,
but basically the, the
idea is that in the early
days the the growth
is slow and then you'll hit an
inflection point, it will take
off. So the focus
was still now on
getting uh
getting things moving. So
we're in the flat part of the curve
at the beginning. Uh
Then I'm just
a 5% of new
sales would be a number
that represents the flat
part of the S curve, which is where
we're at to begin. >> Yeah,
thank you for that. I was
about to have to apologize
for the chairman for bringing
up that 5% number. It
was one that I
already knew
and I believe the advanced
clean car two
rule
mandates. What
percent of those
vehicle sales in New
Mexico we
will have to have
by the year
2027
43%.
Is that an accurate
statement?
And Mr Chairman
presenters
I would submit that's not an
s curve but a hockey
stick.
And I'm hearing many,
many complaints
from car dealers across
the state that
that mandate is
unrealistic,
unworkable and
unachievable.
Thank you, Mr Chairman. I'm
done. >> Thank
you, represent Scott.
Um And
that's it for this panel. Thank
you all very much. We appreciate
your input.
Um
We, if the next panel
could come on up, we have a little
bit of housekeeping before we
start the next panel. First
off, there
is a great toy Toyota
four rer in the,
in the parking lot.
It's part, it's license plates
in includes RB
24 that's a partial
license plate, but the alarm
is going off and apparently has been
for some time.
Gray Toyota
4runner. So,
um also we have some,
some members
um
uh who
haven't introduced themselves
yet,
ok? If, if the,
ok, we're, we're just gonna
keep rolling. So if you guys,
you in the back could keep your
conversation to a minimum. I'd
appreciate it. Uh
Representative
Matthews
Herbs Matthews, would you
like to introduce yourself?
You're gonna need a microphone.
You're getting me a microphone.
I give
>> you.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr Chair.
I'm Marion Matthews. I
represent um
I'm the representative for district
27
in Bernal. County uh
up in the northeast House of
Albuquerque. And
I've been a member of the House
Agriculture uh
Water and Natural
Resources Committee
for four
years
um with a particular
interest in water
and agriculture
and how we continue to have
enough uh water to
grow enough food, to
take care of our population
and our needs. Thank
you. >> Thank
you, Senator
Lopez.
>> Good afternoon. Good afternoon,
Mister Chair Linda
Lopez. State Senator
district 11, the Southwest
quadrant of Bernalillo
County.
>> Thank you, Senator Lopez and
uh Representative Ortez is here as
well, but I think she stepped out of the
room.
Ok. Our next panel
is
turning the
page extreme
heat and public health.
Uh We are starting
unfortunately about 15 minutes
late and we have
a onehour panel and four
speakers.
Um So I'm
gonna need you to, to,
you know, be between like
five and seven minutes in your
presentations so we
can have time for questions.
We typically go in the
order on the as it
appears on the agenda.
Um So
first up, we have Lauren
Reichelt
and you're gonna need to turn your microphone
on it's on and then
just move it in front of you so
you can speak right into
it.
>> Is that better? Yes,
thank you, Mr Chairman
madam, vice chair
and members of the committee
for this honor of speaking
before you today. My
name is Lauren Reichel.
I am the environmental
health division director.
Um and we are
currently working
on uh development
of a heat standard for
employers for
um to protect our New
Mexico workers in my
division. Uh
So why are we doing
that? He, if you
take a look at the
set of slides, I have up
there. Heat stress,
emergency department visits
have risen dramatically
throughout New Mexico. Since
2010
heat related environment
department visits increase
as the temperature increases
and sharply increase above
90
°F. Heat
related ed visits are
increasing most steeply
in southern and northwestern
New Mexico where we
have many outdoor
workers. The
majority of heat related
ed visits are males
in the 18 to 44
year age range.
Um And if you take a look at that
first slide, uh heat
related illness visits
to New Mexico emergency
departments nearly doubled
from 2010 to
2022
from a little over
200 to a
little over 420
22. Um
These are only the
visits that
are directly
uh coded as
heat related illnesses
from heat exhaustion
and, and heat
stroke. And so
if you wanted the real
number, you'd have to
add a zero to the
end and then either
double or quad or even
quintuple. It depending on
which expert you are
looking at. We had
over 900 visits
due to heat in 2023
that we know about.
Um that could be
as many as 45,000
using the uh technique
I just mentioned to you.
And in 2024
we've already had over
600 visits due to
heat. Um If
you look at the,
the next slide
that I have up there, New
Mexico has received
142 heat
related complaints from workers
since adopting federal
Osha's national emphasis
in May of
2023.
Um We've gone from
five deaths in
2010
to 20
known deaths in
2022 which
could again
be
anywhere from
400
to uh I don't
know, you'd have to quadruple it. I'm not
gonna do the math in my head.
Uh nationwide, over
30 workers are killed by
environmental heat each
year on average.
Um Can I have my next
slide?
So,
um
the first, the first
box, there deals
only with heat stroke
and heat exhaustion. The
two acute conditions that
are likely to bring
workers into an
emergency room and
result in the physician
actually diagnosing
heat related illness,
stroke is a catastrophic,
acute explosive
illness characterized
by 20 to 80%
mortality rates.
Um What happens
during heatstroke is
the blood is diverted
from the core to
skin in order to
cool a person down.
Um It, there's not
enough blood going to the gut
which starts to leak
and the immune
response is
catastrophic and
targets the organs
uh resulting in destruction
of multiple organs, which
is not how we want our
workers to die.
Chronic exposure to
heat uh has
been known to correlate with
chronic kidney disease and
agricultural workers. And the
other piece of that box is
that uh chronic
disease and
delayed responses
do not necessarily show
up as heat related in the
emergency room. He
is a force multiplier
and exacerbates chronic
conditions caused
causing ed visits
and even deaths that are not
coded as heat related
including cardio vs
cardiovascular
disease, kidney
disease and respiratory
illnesses. Days
of extreme heat are
associated with excess
relative risk for ed
visits for any cause
nationwide. Although we have
not yet had the opportunity
to look yet at the specific
data set for New Mexicans
mostly because
we the Doh does
not have the funding to do that
kind of a deep dive.
This also results in lost
work, worker productivity
caused by acute and chronic
heat related conditions
resulting in company
losses and
really high costs to
our health care system.
I'm going to skip
the lovely video that
I was going to show you
even though it's only four
minutes. Um
which was made by
Chelsea Langer who
is our extraordinary
epidemiologist at
Doh. And all I would like
to say about that is we could
really use 6.5 more
of her.
Um What can we
do to mitigate
heat related
deaths and illness of
workers? I
have tried to
summarize this in a
manner that is
simple enough that I could
say it's standing on 1
ft. Um
It's not expensive.
We could allow
workers frequent short
breaks and cool areas or
rooms, access to
water and, or electrolyte
drinks throughout the
day and use of
a buddy system. And this is
primarily because
uh heat illness
affects judgment. So a
person suffering from it might
not know they need to go sit
down and get out of the heat.
Um What can the
legislature do to
help? You
can increase nme
D's budget flexibility
right now. It's pretty tight. So
permit fees can be used
to increase the environmental
health division's
ability to address heat
safety issues. You
can support the executive
recommendation for
nmednme D's
budget in the 2025
legislative session
and you can strengthen the Department
of Health's ability to
gather data required to
understand heat impacts
and mitigations to New
Mexico workers. And
with that, I'll turn it over to
Nate and if you would all like to break
out the popcorn and see a
movie later, we can let
that happen.
>> Ok.
All right. Uh Mr Chair
madam, vice chair, honorable members
of the committee. My name is Nathaniel
Matthews Trigg. I'm a founding
board member of healthy climate,
New Mexico. I'm
also a heat public health
expert. Um
It is critical for our state
leaders to understand how we can
work together to reduce
the health impacts of extreme
heat a hazard which we
know is growing more frequent and
intense
next slide. Um Our
approach to extreme heat is
ignoring the science and
experience of frontline
communities. We've
been treating a systemic
crisis as if it were merely
a matter of personal
responsibility.
But the stark reality is
this every summer,
New Mexicans are dying,
preventable deaths.
It's time we shift our focus
from individual actions
to collective community
efforts. Only by
working together can we dismantle
the barriers that have left so
many of our communities at
risk?
Next slide
to effectively combat heat
related deaths, we must identify
and understand the most vulnerable
groups. These
include socially isolated
individuals,
um those with chronic
medical conditions,
workers without access to
cooling like Lauren talked
about adults over the
age of 65
very young Children,
uh teenagers engaged
in outdoor activities,
people with disabilities,
pregnant people and people that
use substances.
Each group faces
unique challenges from
language barriers to
act to lack of health
care, access
discrimination and
economic hardships.
There's no one size
fits all solution to
this issue. Instead,
we need targeted strategies
that address the specific
barriers that each of these groups
face by
focusing on these vulnerable
populations and their
distinct needs. We can develop
effective community
wide approaches to
prevent heat related tragedies
across our state.
Yes. Uh to protect
our communities. Collaboration is
critical. On the
left here of this slide, we
can see the current status
quo. The National weather
service puts out an alert about
extreme heat coming.
Local media will pick it out
and put some messaging to the
public. Uh Public
health will be informed and might put out
some messaging about how people can
stay cool. Emergency
management will receive those alerts
and in some cases, they will
opening open cooling
shelters. However,
we know that without engaging
the organi organizations
and institutions
represented on the on the
left here, actually on the right of your
screen, um
many of our existing
interventions are totally
ineffective and a waste of
money. Uh telling
someone to get somewhere
cooler. Uh if they
don't have access to transportation
is pointless
setting up cooling centers
that are not welcoming, that don't
allow pets or
in inaccessible locations
will mean that the people that need them
are unable to go to
them. We are missing
opportunities to leverage
our most trusted messengers,
health care providers who can
share alerts such as the location
of cooling centers to their vulnerable
patients. There's
just so much we can do but
the critical stakeholders
are not being engaged.
We are failing to support
those who need our
support.
Next slide. Perfect. There
are many places we can look
to for inspiration.
The city of Phoenix is doing
much. I will skip
to the next slide for the sake of
time
recognizing just how
far we have to go in New
Mexico um to
protect our communities was a
big inspiration for healthy
climate, New Mexico to develop
a heat policy advisory.
It's a list of 10
actions that state
agencies, local
governments, community
organizations can take
to create more heat resilient
communities. This advisory
was informed by frontline
community experiences,
scientific evidence
and case studies.
Um And we can learn a lot from
what other states and cities are
doing. All of these
recommend all of these
recommendations require
leadership collaboration
and resources. That's
why we highlight the need
for climate, health, infrastructure
and expertise within the Department
of Health. As my colleague,
Shelley Man Lev, here we'll speak
to next.
So the first recommendation
is for a statewide
evidence-based occupational
heat standard like Lauren
Reichelt mentioned. Uh This
is incredibly necessary
to protect those who are most vulnerable
and are toiling in extreme
heat every day.
Recommendation number two,
we need to improve our public
health surveillance systems to really
understand the actual number
of heat related injuries and
mortality. Um
We are currently only capturing
a small amount as as
Lauren had mentioned, but
without knowing the critical number
of people being impacted by
extreme heat, we really
can't evaluate and
understand how
effective our interventions
are.
Uh Next slide,
please. Recommendation
three is to treat heat
as a mass casualty
event, leveraging
emergency response
systems already in place
to support first responders,
health care providers
who during extreme heat
events see surgess in
patients similar to
other mass casualty
incidents.
Recommendation four is
to prepare for concurrent
hazards such as blackouts
which would make the technology
we all depend on to stay
cool useless,
dramatically, increasing the
number of heat
casualties. A
study recently came
out um looking
at Phoenix if there was a
five day heatwave
and blackout
half the city they
estimated would need emergency
department care. Tens
of thousands would perish
even a fraction of this
type of event here in New Mexico
would be catastrophic
leading to major political
ramifications like
the 1995
Chicago heatwave
and presentations like
this will garner renewed
attention.
Next, a recommendation
five is to ensure our
communities have cooling
shelters which
are safe accessible and
culturally appropriate for the
people that need them.
Recommendation six
is to supply cooling
resources to organizations
that work on the frontline.
We have heard from these
organizations that simple
things like water bottles,
cooling towels,
small indoor thermometers
can provide critical support
to vulnerable
individuals.
Recommendation seven
is based on research showing
that many people don't use their
ac or swamp cooler
because they can't afford the energy
bill. People
literally cook inside their
homes because they can't pay a
few dollars to stay
cool. This is an
incredible injustice and
we need to look for ways to support
those who have to
decide between putting food on the
table and keeping their homes
cool.
Recommendation eight is
to establish a statewide
heat hotline. We
know that during heatwaves
911 systems are often
overwhelmed with calls.
Many of which are people asking
about their heat related
symptoms. Can we
leverage existing
nurse hotlines such
as the one at the Department
of Health to provide answers
to basic questions about
if people need to go to the emergency
room or can just see
their, their primary care
physician
recommendation. Nine is to
be proactive in in our
messaging and to
tailor our messages
uh to high risk groups.
So right now, for example,
the National Weather Service sends
out heat alerts
um at a threshold
in which the general public
faces risk.
However, we know that
people that are vulnerable
face conditions which are
much dangerous to their health
10 to 15 degrees
cooler. Can we
work with the National Weather Service
to send out alerts to high
risk people at a lower
threshold. And
then lastly, recommendation
10 is to support our rural
and tribal communities that
face the unique challenges
due to dispersed geographic
area, lack of infrastructure
and being
under-resourced.
And thank you all for
listening and please don't hesitate to
reach out and I look forward to your questions.
Thank
you.
>> Thank you so much. Thank
you, Lauren and Nate
Mr chair madam, vice
chair and members of the committee. My
name is Shelly Man Lev
and I am the executive Director
of Healthy Climate, New Mexico,
a relatively new
organization that
has very
significant goals to
address climate and health issuess
in New Mexico, of
which heat is one of the most
serious. Our organization
began a year and a half ago.
As you heard natives on the
board, we have a number
of co-founders. We are
public health and health care
professionals whose
goal is to mobilize
people like ourselves
all over the state to
advocate for climate
solutions that protect
health and promote
equity. Why is
that important? Because heat
threatens health
enormously and
is a major issue of
equity as you saw
by those vulnerable groups
that Nate
outlined
next slide.
The case for
legislation, the
statewide public health and
climate program and
fund is an issue
that we have been working on for
the last three years. One
of our sponsors, Senator
Stefani is here. We're so grateful
for all the legislative support
we've had.
Why is it needed? And what does
it have to do with health?
Well, New Mexico is
getting hotter. You heard this
morning from our state climatologist.
You keep hearing New
Mexico has actually
warmed faster than
any of the continental United
States, any other state in the lower
48 and
heat is the deadliest
form of climate impacts
on health.
We may not know that because
again, this issue of undercount,
we do not have accurate
data, we do not have
complete data. We
need that and no state
does. Although there's a few who are
doing a little better than us,
um but we lack the
capacity to do that.
What we do is telling us
the trends, right? When
you hear about those emergency
department visits, what
you're hearing really is the trends,
right? The doubling, the doubling
again and we don't
even know this year, it may be
doubling or quadrupling.
But again, that
multiplier of
zeros of, you know,
it is significantly
more. We say the
tip of the iceberg is what
we hear, right? Not sure
that should apply to heat.
And again, that issue of heat
equity next
slide.
So
we have worked
with our, actually, I
guess I see doubles there.
It is. Thank you.
Um
our state agencies
particular, our agency that's
devoted to protecting health and
promoting equity. The Department
of Health cares
tremendously about this
and they unfortunately
do not have the capacity
to do what's needed to be done
currently in the Department of
Health. They is a
0.2
FTE that is
Doctor Chelsea Langer. She's
fabulous, but eight
hours a week does not begin
to allow us to gather
the data to build a
capacity to do the communications
and education that are
needed. And we have an opportunity
to do that.
Now,
the history of this legislation
began when
actually almost 15
years ago, the CDC
established a program of
funding for climate and health
programs called brace
and invited all the states
to participate. New Mexico
applied in 2011 and we were
not selected.
10 years later, we applied
again. 2021
we applied for $2.5
million in funding. We had an
outstanding proposal
done by our
er d our
Environmental Public Health
Tracking Bureau put
forward, it was scored very
highly. However, we were not
funded again. Why?
Because we lacked staff
capacity. You know,
it's that old challenge
we have, which is we have to have
the capacity to leverage
the funds to do the work
that is so needed in terms of
building our
capacity.
There was a public health infrastructure
task force that was established in
2021 through the work
of our legislature.
Hb two and
many of us including myself,
I was the president of the New Mexico Public
Health Association had the
opportunity to participate
in that work. And
that was a 10 month project
led by the Department of Health
again, with Public health leaders from all
over the state.
And um Nate
actually invited, he had
a colleague, University of Washington,
Doctor Chris Ebe, who had
worked on the International
IPCC report
came and gave a presentation
and I have to say like so many
of us in public health who
really knew very little about
climate and health
people were so blown away. They
made it one of their top
recommendations. It
was one of the top three
recommendations from
the Public Health Infrastructure task
force that was 2022
and it's not yet funded or in
place. And what is
that? That is
next slide, please.
That is to create
a state public
health and climate program.
We can call it public health and
extreme weather program. A
program that will deal with
issues first and foremost,
like heat, of course, also
wildfire, smoke, drought,
flooding dust. We know there are
many severe storms,
many impacts that need to
be addressed. But heat,
heat is impacting
the health of New Mexicans
frankly more than any of
them at this point in time.
And that program needs to be
robust 6.5
FTE surveillance
surveillance as well as
evaluation is
critical without data. Not
only can we not know if our programs
are effective, but we don't
even know where the needs
are. We don't know the
areas of our state. We have some
general idea, but
we've got to better understand
what's happening. And of course, we have
to do it in a culturally appropriate
way that engages our
tribes with the tribal
liaison, that has a health
equity specialist,
a medical director
with the expertise
to address climate and
health. In addition,
of course, we know
that it needs to have a
fund because you can't
just do this work with
6.5 people
in Santa Fe or Albuquerque,
right? You've got to have
resources for the
communities who most need
them. So the second
part of the bills that have been
proposed, HB
42 SB five
back in 2022
excuse me, 2023.
And last year, HB
104, which
was we worked very closely with
as well with New Mexico voices
for Children would establish
a $10 million
community resiliency
fund. It would go
hand in hand with the work that's
being done by em nerd
in terms of their climate adaptation
and response plan. But
our communities need
resources and
those resources need to go
to smaller
communities, especially,
you know, places like Bernal
County have a lot more
resources and that
fund would be dedicated at
least 50% to
communities with populations of
less than $100,000
including tribes, local
safety associations
could be school districts. And
what would it do next? Slide,
please?
It would help
provide technical assistance
and training and planning if that was
needed in terms of expertise.
And most importantly,
it would enable the purchasing of
supplies and
resources for high risk
individuals, things
like air quality
or even temperature monitoring
devices. Not everybody has
a thermometer, they're not all that
cheap. And of course,
there are more complicated
ways of measuring temperature that
may be important for certain
individuals and
air conditioning. I have to
say I just got off the phone
couple hours ago with
one of people works for health
insurance company. She was telling me the
story of her father. We
don't have time for stories,
but an air conditioner
saved his
life. And I have to
say there are so many lives that
are risk because people
are hot and they don't have
the resources and they don't even
know, they don't even know that
they need that. Of course,
on a systemic level,
as Nate talked about the kind
of cooling centers that we
need. What about
converting bus stops to
cooling shelters? They're like
a pop-up shelter. They already have
shade but they need a water
fountain. We need water
supplies, right? We
need other kinds of cooling
supplies, misting stations
to go with that. So
in closing next
slide,
I want to thank you for your work
and encourage you to really
consider how legislative
policy can put in
place the elements. We
need to build a strong
foundation to address heat. Thank
you so
much.
>> Ok, Mr, chair
and uh madam vice
chair members of the committee. My name
is Cheryline Antonio and
I am the tribal liaison
at the New Mexico Alliance of Health
Councils. And so
we are a nonprofit
organization who provides
ancillary services to
all 43 counties and
tribal health councils.
Um One of those an are
examples of ancillary services
that we provide include
training, technical assistance
and um
finding grants or
grant writing uh on behalf
of County and tribal Health councils.
And so, one of those current active
grants right now is called
the Chica grant.
Um The climate change health
impacts and community actions
grant. Um This is funded by
the Office of Minority Health.
Um This is a federal grant,
not a state grant. And
just to note, we're essentially
doing a pilot of this
type of grant funding right now
with health councils
um diving into
climate and health work right
now. And so I
just want to note here on the
right side um as part
of this work with the Chica
um five Health Councils
and, and their communities have
identified public
water systems as a top
priority. Uh You can
see here on the graph, there are additional
priorities noted.
Um But
to save time,
I'm gonna go ahead and go here to the next
slide.
Um I'm really here to speak
about some of the county or
excuse me, the community
level initiatives that are happening,
right. Now all done by Health
councils specific
to climate health.
Um And so Bernalillo
County right now is primarily
focusing on the heat island
effect. And so this is looking at heat
as a by-product from
industrialization,
Sebola County um
focusing on researching
the impacts of drought in
their community and
Quay County in the southeastern
part of the state, focusing on water
conservation and safe drinking
water. And
so as you can see across the
board here, um just to give
some high-level overviews,
Bernalillo County and Qua County
experiencing
um high levels of
emergency department visits and
hospitalizations in
both counties. Um
Bernalillo County um
experiencing um
high levels of high
rates of asthma and
COPD and
so could be in co uh in
correlation to air pollution
um in their
community. And
lastly, Sebola
County um really
focusing in addition to
the health outcomes looking at
the economic system in their
community. Uh And
you can see from the high levels of
drought, farmers and ranchers are
struggling to keep their small businesses
alive in the county.
In addition to that, experiencing
high dust storms and water
restrictions in the community
um leaving high
impact um
on animals um
recreational sites and
families um especially
for those gardening.
And so, um some
of the Health Council initiatives
currently right now, one
across the board is doing
um education
for the public and youth.
Um Number two
is um
building capacity around
climate, health and change with training and
technical assistance.
And three, working in partnership
with the local and
Pueblo environmental health
departments.
Um Next slide
please at
the tribal level uh for
tribal health councils, two of them
are currently involved in this grant, Santa
Domingo Pueblo and Santa Clara
Pueblo. Um Just for
context, this information is coming
directly from the Pueblos
themselves. Um
So some of the
focus for Santa Domingo
Pueblo is one,
preserving the traditional
practices with farming and
agriculture. Number
two is making um
climate health
um education
accessible in the Carri language.
Number three is advocating
for funding and resources
due to the limited infrastructure
and funding from the state
for climate health initiatives.
Santa Clara is similar to Santa
Domingo is focusing on
indigenous approach to
um climate health um
impacts. However,
um in the northeast eastern part
of the state, they've been highly
um impacted by the
wildfires and
so leaving them with drier
conditions. Um shrunken
waterways and parched
pastures. Um
So some of the initiatives across
the board from both of the tribal
communities that we work with
is one to do comprehensive
assessments specific
to climate health. Um So
that's doing climate health surveys, getting
feedback and input.
Um Number two,
they're both restoring
and are either establishing a
greenhouse projects with their tribal
elder centers. And so
due to drought and heat,
a lot of those um
greenhouse projects have been
put to a halt in addition
to funding and capacity,
no one to support that work
three is doing.
Um Let's
see, uh working
on some interagency collaboration
as you know, the jurisdictions
overlap between federal state and
local. And so
I just wanna also
know on the Santa Domingo side
most recently, uh some of
the priorities have been on their
dialysis clinic
due to water concerns.
The uh Santa Domingo
Pueblo dialysis clinic is
closed now. So they've
had to transport um
tribal members to
Santa Fe or Albuquerque
for for treatment.
And so the health council is
working on
transportation and
working with their coun uh tribal
council to mitigate some of
this um
next slide, please.
And so with some of these challenges
and recommendations noted,
at least from a tribal perspective.
Number one, we're seeing the
need for tribal consultation
specifically on climate and
health um efforts
to hear from tribal leadership
across the state directly
at the state level to inform
what services are needed, what
programs are needed and
what types of funding
is needed for this type of
work. Number two
is for tribal level
climate health data.
Um We
were as we're engaging in this
work, there is no tribal level
data, for example,
if you go on the new Mexico envi
environment public health tracking
dashboard. Um There
is county level data, but
there's no tribal level data,
there's limitations and
IHS does not send their data
to the state. So there's
not a comprehensive picture
of how um tribal
communities in our state are
affected.
And number four, I
think we all touched on this
funding and capacity
um for this work
to happen at a community level,
uh especially from state
agencies would be important.
Uh Health Councils feel that they
lack staffing technical
expertise and legal support
for a lot of this work.
Uh Five community engagement
and partnerships um that's where
health councils can serve in assessment
and planning on behalf of this
work. Um Six, I
think Nate talked about this but
improving communications across
sectors um getting timely
updates to communities
um specifically to climate,
health advisories and funding
announcements
and that completes
my slide and
so go ahead and pass
it back to you,
Shelley.
>> Thank you so
much.
>> Thank you all
um for the
presentation uh
questions from the
committee
and
Senator Felix.
>> It's more. Thank you, Mr
Chair. It's more a comment
I had uh brought this up
this morning that there needed
to be um
collaboration among
Allstate agencies
and
that there are
many topics
that fit into
the category of looking
at climate events
and preparing
individuals, the
communities
and the state for this.
So for example,
I think that there are three or
four different
state agencies had that
have a Climate Bureau or
Division and
that each of
them uh
focus on something
different. So
if we could
bring together
the entities that are
working on this, we might be
able to better
fund something
as a whole rather
than piecemeal. So that's
my only comment. Thank you, Mr
Chair
represent Lujan.
>> I would I just again
comment to you. I I would
just
support what
Senator just said
because
um there are so many
initiatives out there and I think
that we're all moving
towards kind of the
same type of goal. So
how I guess my question, how
are you, how are you forming
that, that
coalition with
stakeholders in the same
on this topic?
And where is the consensus,
Mr
Chair?
Thank you,
>> Mr Chair, Chairman
Representative
Lujan. Um
I would really appreciate
some sort of a
committee of
state agencies like
that just to give
you an example. Uh we
were really slowed down and
pulling together the
heat, the the
heat standard. It may
have been ready last year,
but we had to wait
on data because
doh did not have enough
epidemiologists
and I did try
several options
to help them.
Um But none of them
really worked. Like, for
example, I formed
a relationship with N MS
U and brought in interns
to see if we could have interns
working with the E DS
to get the data they
needed. But that
we ran into all kinds of
issues with HIAA and
we just couldn't do it that way.
But if we had a committee
where we were all there
together, I think
it would really help cut
through some of that red
tape.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair
and Representative
Lujan.
While it is true that
there are three agencies
specifically that have climate
programs.
What I will say is in terms of
adaptation and resilience,
specifically related to
heat, that there's a substantial
lack of staff and capacity
amongst those agencies,
healthy climate. New Mexico has
actually met with
together.
Yes, there's need for more agency
communication, but I don't believe
it's a lack of interest.
Um em nerd in doing
their Carp Clan brought
agency staff together for
three meetings. They were relatively
short. Different people
came, it, it takes
time and it takes staff
resources. So
um I'm gonna say
particularly the Department of
Health needs additional
resources in order to
participate in a
meaningful way, right, to
contribute the absolutely
essential data to that process.
Um There are the two other
agencies DH you
know, Department of Homeland Security
Emergency Management and
a and our new health care authority
that need to be at the table as well.
Um But there is definitely
a need for additional capacity.
Thank
you.
>> Thank you Mr Chair. And we know I
mean mister chair, I do know that
the Alliance
of Health uh councils
has, has made the statement
of where
they they are looking policy,
their direction for policy is.
So thank you for that and thank you
for, you know, being
um
succinct I would say
and but
expanding your collaboration,
I would say just with, with the
people here on the panel with you would
be my suggestion for you as
well. But that's, that's it. We
need to, we need to get everybody
together and you know,
this is, this
is as we saw the
science and statistics in
front of us today, this is only going
to get worse. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Representative Representative
Garcia,
>> thank you,
Mr
Chairman um
panel. I would think that
you would agree
that given the
the situation
with our
climate
change
um
and uh still an
overabundance of greenhouse
gasses kind
of escaping into the
environment and the
atmosphere
that our state
should kind of really beef
up resources
in terms of the impacts that
climate change is having in our
community.
But not only that uh
Mr Chair, also,
we have an epidemic
in our community regarding
the fentaNYL
addiction.
And also we have issues,
Mr Chair also regarding
our, our youth,
teenage pregnancy,
uh
adequate sexual
um
um protections
um
um within
our youth.
So you would think that the
state should step
up and kind of
do its role play its
role in terms
of kind of
addressing these
health
uh scenarios,
health needs throughout our
state. So my
question to you all
is why
is the governor
shutting down our public
health
clinics?
>> Um
Yeah,
Mr Chair and Representative
Garcia, we're not aware that the governor's
shutting down public health clinics.
However, what I will
say is, and I appreciate you
just noting that there's a
great need for substantial
more investment
in public health and that
to address things at an
individual level with health care,
health care is critical,
absolutely critical.
It accounts for 10 to 20%
of people's well being and that public
health, the systems
that support the conditions,
whether it's social determinants of
health, including climate
change and heat. That's
an environmental condition,
that's deeply impacting health.
We've got to have greater
investment in our local health
councils, greater
investment in our full
public health system to
address everything from
overdose and fentaNYL
teen pregnancy,
the well being of our youth
and the well being of our entire
population that's so deeply
threatened by heat and
other climate change impacts.
So, thank
you.
>> That was my only question, Mr Chair,
but it is disappointing
that the governor is shutting
down public health
clinics
throughout the state. She shut
down one
model
health um
public health clinic in my
district there in the
Alamosa
neighborhood. It
was a model
um
clinic that
involved
a peer
mentor group
amongst young uh
Chicanos.
Uh
in terms of stepping up and
being a
father
to their child
and their, their
child was basically,
um,
kind of,
um,
the product of
the teenage,
the teenage partner.
And, um,
and also that clinic
had very
viable programs
that dealt with sexually transmitted
diseases.
And it was a model
program,
you know, where it was
under control.
And that teen population and
those young adults,
uh, really had
resources.
They had a safety net
in which
kind of,
uh, uh, kept them
from going into that dark
hole regarding
sexually transmitted diseases.
It also had a model
teen pregnancy
program.
So you can see why I'm so
upset,
you know, when it comes to
providing resources to our
community, especially low income
communities like the Alamosa
community,
you know, by shutting down this
institution that is providing
viable services,
you know, so these populations
that cannot get them anywhere
else.
So, uh I
think that's, that's
an issue that we should take up
with the governor.
You know, you all in
particular, you
know, the advocates at the base
level at the community
level. I
mean, if they're shutting down our
dialysis center, that's
crucial.
I could see what that would mean if they
shut down our dialysis center
there in a Risco which basically serves
the whole South Valley,
you know, 55,000
people. I
mean, uh so I
think we need to step up as
advocates
and kind of put the heat on the
governor to start
funding health
resources in our
much needed communities
that are proven to be model,
model programs. Mr Chair
throughout our state.
Thank
you.
I think we would all
agree that access
to dialysis
is absolutely critical
for anybody
who's suffering from
kidney conditions in a
heatwave.
>> So I, I want to thank you
for the presentation. I think this
is,
you know, one of those issues
that in some ways has
always been with us,
but it is getting worse and we're
starting to pay attention to it.
And I know, you know, from my
experience, I, I built a
house about
15 years ago
here in New Mexico
and, and didn't install any
cooling equipment because I didn't
need it
and I don't feel
that way anymore.
Um I mean, we used
to where I live,
my theory was, we had a, we
had a week of 93 weather
every year and now
it's a month or two months and,
and it, um,
it, it makes a difference.
Uh and that's, you know, at
5000 or 6000
ft. So, thank you
very much. I
appreciate uh the
information
for >> the opportunity.
>> Our next panel is air
quality emissions, smoke,
uh more on dust
and health.
And if panelists uh want
to come forward and take a seat.
I'm not sure everyone is
quite here yet.
Um, but we'll go ahead and get
started.
Um,
maybe we are here. We'll
see. Uh, we'll
go ahead and get started.
Um, and see how it goes.
We generally, as I've said,
we go in the order
as it appears on
the
agenda.
So we'll start with
Joanne
Strother.
So you're gonna need to turn the mic
on and really
put it at least
directly in front of you. So it
picks you up.
Well,
>> all right. There we
go.
Chair committee. My name is Joanna
Strother. I'm the senior director of
advocacy for the American
Lung Association. And today
I'm gonna talk about our state of the air
report. Um, next
slide. So
every year, the American Lung Association
issues a state of the air
report which is our
annual National Air
Quality Report card to help
people learn about their local
air quality and to be
better protect themselves and
their families.
This year we celebrated
25 years of state
of the air report.
State of the air focuses the
public's attention on
ozone and particle
pollution. Two of the
most widespread and
dangerous air pollutants
that are regulated by the Clean Air
Act. The
report also gives grades
to 935
US counties with
air quality monitors
and gives rankings to the
25 metro areas with
the worst air pollution.
It also includes a cleanest
cities list.
Next slide,
particle particle pollution
comes from a diverse mix of
solid particles and liquid
droplets suspended in the
air which are harmful when
inhaled. In this
report, we specifically look
at PM 2.5
because it's a very tiny
particle that lodges deep down
into the lungs.
There's a bug here. Particle
pollution can be very dangerous
to breathe, especially at
higher concentrations.
It can trigger illness,
hospitalization and
premature death and can even
cause lung cancer.
Next.
um ozone more
commonly known as
smog is created when
volatile organic
compounds. Uh
Vo
CS
mix with nitrogen
oxides, also known
as nox and in the
presence of sunlight and
heat, ozone is
formed, ozone
acts like a sunburn to the
lungs
causing or making
worse lung disease,
exposure to unhealthy levels
of ozone air
pollution continues to make
breathing difficult for more
Americans across the country
than any other single
pollutant. Next
slide,
we champion clean air for
all because ozone and
particle pollution cause harm
to Children and adults
at every stage of life
and across multiple systems of
the body, not just
respiratory. The health
impacts of ozone and particle
pollution are well documented
based on decades of scientific
research exposure
to ozone and particle pollution
contribute to a wide range
of negative health effects
and are especially dangerous to
Children. Seniors,
people living with asthma
and other health
conditions. These
health impacts are felt more
heavily by our most vulnerable
populations.
Next slide.
So the report is compiled
using U SEPA
quality assured data
by county. The
data for this year's report
was collected in 2020
2021 and
2022
and are the latest
available EPA
then reviews the data and post
it online where our consultant
downloads and prepares it
for us. We use this
data to calculate unhealthy
days, weighted
averages and grades and
rankings. Bless
you next
slide.
Um in spite of progress,
um it's
been made by the Clean
Air Act over 50 years.
There are still way too many
people breathing in unhealthy
air. In this year's
state of the air report, we found
100 and 31 million
people living in counties
that receive at least one
F grade that's
up from 100 and 20
million in last year's
report. So it's
amounting to nearly four in
10 people in the United
States including
nearly 2 million Children
with asthma and
15.7
million adults with
chronic lung disease.
Next.
And the disparity in exposure to air
pollution along racial
and ethnic lines continues
to be a serious concern.
Although people of color are about
42% of the
overall population of
the US. There are
52% of
people living in counties
with at least one failing
grade. People of
color are also more likely than
white people to be living with
one or more chronic
condition that
makes them more susce susceptible
to the health impact of air
pollution, including asthma
and diabetes next
slide.
As you've heard a lot today, our
changing climate is a health
emergency. So the
significant rise in the number
of individuals whose health
is at risk is the result
of a combination of
factors. Extreme
heat, drought and
wildfires are contributing
to the steady increase in
deadly particle pollution,
especially in the western
US. And here in New
Mexico next
slide,
wildfires are not
only increasing the
number of days and places
with unhealthy spikes from particle
pollution. There are also
increasing in the severity
of pollution resulting
in a sharp increase seen
over the last several reports
of state of the air.
Um and of the number of
days designated by either
purple or Maroon on the
air quality index.
These very healthy
and hazardous days
are a serious health threat to
everyone living in those areas
and are unlike anything we have
seen in the history of state of the
air. Next
slide.
Um And this year for the first
time, only Western
cities are on the worst
25 list for short-term
particle pollution. This
is a big change from
earlier years of the report
when historically urban
industrialized
eastern and midwestern
cities dominated the
list.
Next
and so so key findings for New
Mexico. Um
51% of New
Mexicans live in a county
with at least one failing
air grade while
32% of
New Mexicans live in a
county with three
failing air grades.
Next
and
next.
Next slide.
There we go. These
are the top 10 most polluted
cities in the US for
Ozone. Las
Cruces ranked 15th
most polluted for ozone.
The city saw more days on
average but actually had a
better ranking
while these are city
rankings. Oh, I'm sorry, I
missed um
Albuquerque. I don't know. It's on my
notes. So, um in Albuquerque
ranked the 21st
most polluted city
for ozone.
Um, while these are city
rankings, I also wanted to
point out that Eddie
County is
ranked as the 17th
most polluted county
in the US for ozone.
The county had more
ozone compared to last year's
report and is
only one of two
rural counties in the
entire country that are on the
top 25
list. The other one
is Mariposa
California. Next
slide.
Um This is the top 10 most
polluted list um for
annual particle
pollution. Albuquerque
ranked 47
42nd most polluted
for annual particles.
This is a worse annual
level and we also now
fail to meet the national
air Quality standard.
It's also a worse ranking.
We were 63rd
last year. Las
Cruces, El Paso area
ranked 57th most
polluted for year-round particles.
They also had a higher
average. Um And that
ranking rose from
74th last
year. Next
slide
this year for the first time only
western cities are on the worst
25 list for short term
particle pollution. This is
a big change from early years
of the report.
Albuquerque ranked 34th
for short term particles.
That's a worse rank. We were
55th last
year. We did see
more days when particle
pollution reached unhealthy.
This is our worst ever
ranking in 25 years of
the report and this
is also following the spring
2022
wildfires.
Um Las Cruces, El
Paso area ranked 40th
most polluted for short term
particles. They actually have the
same number of particle
days um and
a better ranking though
next.
Um Many people want to know
how this year's results compared
with previous years and the best
place to go. That is of course on our
website. But to get a good
picture is to look at these
trend charts,
they are both, we have
trend trend charts, both
on ozone and particle
pollution and look at
both counties and metro
areas. In most
cases, you can see a downward
trend over time. Thanks
to the Clean Air Act
and States also willingness
to pass policy and,
and do more. Um So
here's the ranking for ozone
over time for the Albuquerque metro
area in 25
years of the report. So you can see
up and down and now
trending upwards again.
But when you compare it
to, you know, many years
ago, we're
making progress
and the next slide.
And then lastly, I just want to point out there
are things that individuals can do
to protect themselves from air
pollution such as checking
their daily uh air
pollution forecasts,
protecting themselves
from dust and wildfire
smoke. And we have lots of resources
on how to do that on our
website and
then reducing their personal
emissions with tips from
our stand up to Clean Air
initiative. So not
only are there stuff that are
states and
localities and federal government
can do, but there's so much that we can
do on a personal level to, to
help to clean up our
pollution burdens.
Thank you.
Lastly is
just my information.
Perfect.
>> Thank you very much. Um
I feel to give the uh keep
it short pep talk at the
beginning of the panel. Uh
But I do encourage
you to, to do
so. If everyone goes
10 minutes, we're not gonna have enough time
for questions. So next
up, we have
Maxine Paul.
Go ahead. >> Thank you, Chairman
mcqueen and I will promise to
keep this short with three slides.
Um uh My
name is Maxine Paul. I'm the former
chair of the Albuquerque
Benal County Air Quality
Control Board.
Uh I'm just gonna
tell you what the board does and tell
you about two pieces of
legislation that have been passed
recently.
So first, what is the
board? It has
jurisdiction over air
quality regulations within
Bernalillo County? There's a map
up here of the various
communities. It includes four
tribes and the city of
Albuquerque. The board
does two
different things. It is legislative
and judicial so it adopts new
regulations and it decides
on permit appeals.
There are three members on the board
that are appointed by
members of the Burn County
Commission and there are four members
on the board that are appointed by
the mayor and confirmed
by city
council
and it's authorized by
you. Uh The
enabling legislation is N
MS A
7424,
giving local authority
to local jurisdictions
or authority to local jurisdictions.
Um Next slide,
please.
So there are two regulations
I want to talk about. The first one
you've already heard a little bit about,
I believe. Uh is
it was November 16th
in a joint hearing with the Environmental
improvement Board.
Um And
both boards passed
the Advanced Clean cars,
two heavy-duty,
Omnibus and AC
T advanced Clean Trucks
rules. Um These
rules, first of all,
the reason that there's two
boards that had to have, have a
joint hearing is because
the Clean Air Act essentially
requires states to have
one mobile source emissions
rule. So, rather than
every jurisdiction, having
their own rule, we all have to have the same
rule and
what the
Eib and Air Quality
Control Board did is in
this joint
hearing,
sorry, backing
up. So there's two sort of options
right through mobile
source emissions. You can
use the federal standard
or you can use the California
standard, the California
waiver. You've probably heard of that too.
Uh And
what
was proposed to us and we
accepted was a compromise.
Um Knowing that New
Mexico is not
quite California and that we
have a lot of rural areas
that might be harder
to electrify and take
more time to electrify.
We, we
pass of the regulation
out to 2032.
So there's a couple different
regulations here. But to make it simple,
um this regulation
requires that 45%
of new light duty
vehicles
delivered by the
manufacturer uh
be in model year
2027. So in two years
be um
zero emission vehicles. And
that ramps up gradually
to 82% by
2032. It
doesn't ever require 100 it
only ramps up to 82%.
Um
Now, uh
there's a, there are different regulations
for heavy duty omnibus and
for um ac
t advanced clean trucks.
Um
And uh
there are a number of flexibilities
in this rule. It sounds like a
lot but it allows
for a number of early action credits
um with plug
in hybrid electric vehicles, for
example. Um
And there are like multiyear
period grace periods for
reporting and penalties as
well uh in terms of the
manufacturers and dealers.
So, um and
finally, I think I need to emphasize
this really, this only applies to
new vehicles for sale
starting in model year
2027.
And there are many ex
exemptions including
emergency vehicles, right?
Um Farm equipment.
Um
And there's no question, these rules present
a challenge to our friends in the auto
industry. We heard a lot about that in
the hearing, but it's a challenge
that they're already tackling.
Um They are installing chargers,
they're doing the trainings, they're getting
everyone on board for this new tech
and I do have faith in their capacity
and capability to work,
work to adapt to
this profitably. Um
So I, I have a picture
here for my own first
story and some of the data. So
that's my uh
the same model as my
uh my Volkswagen
Egolf. Um
There are a number of different things that this
rule does and
one of the big ones is
modeled $40
billion in net societal
benefits. So a lot of that
is just my pocketbook, right?
I'm paying way less over the
life of this vehicle in operations and
maintenance than it would be if I were going to
the gas station and doing oil
changes and all that.
Um Another
big thing that this does and why
we passed it is it model
as, as our, as
our Panelist, co Panelist
spoke about how important air
pollution is.
Um There are 66
modeled, avoided premature
deaths from decreasing
the pollution that comes out of
tailpipes just
in our state.
Um So
how does, how do we do that? We're
talking about just like duty
vehicles again? So your, your
trucks and cars that we might
own not use commercially.
Um It decreases
the oxides of
nitrogen in the particulate matter
that you just heard about how
impactful those are
by 80 to 90%.
Um It is
also essential to fight the climate
crisis as you also are
aware. Um the
fleet is the third largest sector
of greenhouse gas emissions in New
Mexico
and
uh
light duty vehicles reduced by
88 million metric tons
carbon dioxide equivalent. That's just
again, the clean cars portion,
not even talking about the AC T and the
HDO portion.
But like I said, this
hearing, we heard a lot
about how important it is
to get rural and
tribal areas in New Mexico
electrified quicker
that folks are,
we need a public charging
network for people to be able to
make this behavioral change.
It is a behavioral change. You know, you
got to plug in instead of
fill up
and folks really do need those
rebates. You heard a lot about
rebates and you heard a lot
about um
incentives.
Um So
I'm going to move on quickly to
and then just ozone in Albuquerque.
One of the reasons why our board passed
this unanimously is
you heard about that? We were,
we are close to non attainment
status and no one wants no
attainment. Industry doesn't want non
attainment, EHD doesn't want
non attainment. It is a lot more
work for a lot more people
and this is a way to
walk back from
ozone because Knox is a
precursor to ozone.
Ok. So the, the
final slide,
the other uh
regulation that
we passed
was a health
equity and environmental impacts
rule. Um
My understanding is that
community organizations
brought forth the issue of environmental
justice in the South Valley
um for the better part of two
decades, uh
There was a title six
case. So civil rights
case that was ongoing
for part
of that. Um
There was a mobile monitoring
trailer that was put out to measure
toxic air pollutants and hazardous
air pollutants and the data still
isn't back yet. Hasn't
been QAQ CD.
Um Long
story short, the board
voted to set up
a committee to address the issue in
2021
advertised it to members of the public
to engage with the department and talk
about this potential
environmental justice issue.
Um In
December 22
full year later, the
one of the community groups or a few
community groups brought forth a draft
regulation to consider for
the board and the
board voted to hear the
regulation. The board has
the ability to vote to
hear a regulation
and accept it, edit
it or reject it, right.
It wasn't a, the
hearing wasn't saying we
accept the regulation.
And in a two
year long process, you should also say
that the board does allow
for uh
uh for um
community groups, anyone to break a
regulation before the board,
um in a two in another
year longs holder
engagement process. So the second
year, there are various
versions of the rule
before a hearing
that happened a full year after
that. Um After,
after accepting
that there would be a hearing,
um and the
board was interested in areas of
compromise between industry
institutions, you
know, um national
security, the
community, all, all
parties were involved there were 19
parties in the hearing. Uh
The rule that passed was
a narrow version of
what community groups
um
proposed. It
requires the department, the
health department to map
neighborhoods top
tw the top 20th
percentile of health
indicators. So neighborhoods that are
getting the worst pollution
um and
to add
one
already uh
quite a
prolific
or already in use
method of
reviewing permits.
So it's called Best Available Control
technology. NMED can tell
you about it and it's
used for all new permits in
Texas and
it applies to those
areas now and to
where, where there
are emissions of taps and
haps toxics and
hazardous
pollutants.
It's something that we heard a lot in the
industry that had already been done
and that consultants are quite
comfortable with.
So I think that that
regulation was
again a compromise
between community
groups that really felt like they didn't
have a say in air pollution
and it, it is only a
first step really there. Um And
then uh industry
and a realistic
pathway to
actually check
emissions
going forward. So
you should see a map
coming out in January according to
that. Um
And uh
I think that's all I have.
So I'll turn it
over.
>> OK. Thank you. Uh Next
up, we don't
have Michelle Miano
because she's
stuck somewhere. We have
Secretary Kinney and
uh NMED again,
>> I'm Donna Bahar. I will be
sitting in for Michelle Miano.
Um I'm her deputy
director of
the Environmental Protection division
over air climate and
radiation control.
Um I have had the
pleasure over the last
three months to actually
sit with the a lot of the air quality
staff and see them um
at their jobs
as opposed to being, you
know, high level director.
So I will keep my
presentation brief, but I
will also get very granular
at the staff level
to show how one how
dedicated they are, but
also how much we are asking
of them
um
to try and meet these huge
challenges. So
I'll start with the
fire and smoke. We
talked this morning extensively
about Rio dos. So
I did include in my hand out
a pic a link
as well as a picture of the
fire and smoke map where all the
data from our
um
14 monitors that are across
the state as well as when there
is an emergency such as fire,
we deploy
um
mobile monitors
primarily to measure PM
10 and PM 2.5
and all this data gets
up uploaded
through NOAA on
these websites. So the data
is available.
Um We
only have seven staff who
maintain and travel
around the state to deploy,
maintain, um
collect data and
review and do quality assurance
on these data.
So during the
um salt in South Fork
wildflower fires, we were there
supporting the US
forest
service as well as local
entities and
the Mescalero tribe.
And the consortium is really
14 federal agencies
plus, you know, four or
five state agencies as
well. Um
I, I won't go into the detail
of PM 2.5
because my
um,
panel member,
um when it uh
describe that, but again, I
will stress that we only
have seven staff to cover the
entire state and when there's
multiple wildfires,
that does become a challenge that
said they are ready to go
and go whenever
asked.
Um, so
moving on to ozone
and methane,
I in
the presentation,
you do have a picture,
a satellite image of methane
emissions in
the southeastern part of the state.
You will see that there are
almost 400
plumes from 100 and
25 sources.
Um Several years ago,
the department passed the
ozone precursor rule.
This was considered a model
for the nation and EPA
adopted a similar rule.
Unfortunately, there
are some discrepancies
such that we have to still
reconcile the
methane rule with the precursor
rule. But we are working on
that and um
it is coming
into
implementation as
a result of
um the
ozone precursor rule. We have about
55 new, so
55,000 new
sources that will we
will be looking at permits
need to be modified to
incorporate the requirements of
all these rules.
Um And we only have
seven staff who work
on promulgating
rules, updating our
state implementation sta
uh uh
plans,
uh helping programs
implement them, work on permit
updates, things like that.
As a result of this, we
have um
increased our number, we
have started to rely
on contractor support
to issue permits. So that
helps.
Well, before I get
into that, I'll show you the third
graph on this slide,
which is how the numbers
of permits at the state
have
grown exponentially
and continue to grow exponentially
every year.
Um
Since 2016,
the majority of these about
80 80% are
from oil and gas.
So we are issuing
permits and the number of permit
writers we have on staff
have not increased
since um
you know, the, the middle
of the,
let's say the middle of the 2000.
So 2015,
2014.
Um so we have
started relying on contractors
that we are on strict deadlines,
statutory deadlines, regulatory
deadlines to issue these. We have
started to rely on contractors
and starting this year, we're relying
even more so that we can release
staff from their permit
writing duties to start helping
on updating
regulations.
Um
Let's
see.
And then in, in response
to the
um satellite
uh data that we're
collecting on methane plumes, we
again have decided to
rely almost entirely
on contractors
to identify
the sources. Reach out to the,
the parties that may be
having these things work on
root cause analysis
to essentially
stop the releases if
possible.
I think with that
um
I think I've hit my major point
so I'll, I'll be
good and stand for
questions.
>> That's just fine. Thank you very much.
Next we have Brandon
Edwards.
Yeah, you're gonna need a microphone.
Maybe, maybe you all could
swap swap
seats,
you gotta be relatively
close to it. There
you go and you have to turn
on
and there's a little, but there's a little
button on the
front.
There we go.
Go ahead.
>> Ok. Just got
a,
a few slides to go
through it. I go through them pretty quick
about uh
vegetation and dust
emission
interactions.
Uh
You go to the next
stop.
Uh anyway,
so wind erosion and dust
impacts has a number of
important impacts
uh including locally at the
source, looking at
land health productivity,
uh vegetation, ecosystem
changes and ecosystem
services and
on the human scale, looking at health
impacts uh hazards
such as highway safety,
uh degraded visibility
and then downstream or
regional uh even
sometimes global impacts
like dust on snow and,
and other climate
forcing.
If you go to the next slide,
please.
So
very basics of
vegetation and
wind erosion processes,
uh
You have reduced uh
wind speeds in the lead of
vegetation elements
and essentially the
smaller that
vegetation gaps are
and the denser the vegetation,
uh the less prone or vulnerable
to wind erosion, uh soil
surface will be just
as a couple of examples. We
can look at the graph uh looking
at sediment fluxes
recorded
uh the orange at
Lordsburg bare
bottom picture and then
the Horna to the Rosa
basins, uh top left
and right pictures just to
give an example of the
way that works, you
go to the next slide.
Uh If we look at vegetation
trends over the last couple of
decades, uh we can see that we're
having uh perennials
increased uh from
2001 to 2010
in our region, but have
decreased over the last
decade.
You can go to the next
one.
Uh We also have a strong trend
of increasing woody
cover over the last decade.
So essentially, this represents
uh perennials being replaced
with shrubs in
many cases for those
sorts of processes occurring.
Uh bare ground,
which is a key
indicator for winder rogen
has remained
fairly neutral
uh over the
last decade. As the
the two vegetation types
have essentially
flipped, you go to
the next
slide.
Um looking at a few
commonalities and projected
climate over the next
half century or so.
Uh look at competitive
advantages for woody vegetation
and loss of grassland and
shrubland. Also
an increase in extreme weather
events.
You don't
uh just to give an
example from New
Mexico. If we look
at how we
classify transitions
between vegetation
communities, uh
We can have models
that show the different states that can
exist uh for different
ecological
areas.
Excellent.
So we can look at
uh transport numbers
recorded uh for the
different states within these areas
which are each colors in the plot.
There, you can see that some
patterns emerge. Uh The
pervasive uh
vegetation changes
uh have profound impacts
potentially on wind erosion.
Uh But the data also show
that there is potential
for a large
reduction in dust with
effective
restoration.
So just some tools
that uh we work on
to address win erosion and dust
emission. We have uh
an alien
erosion model, the aero
model, uh also
the National Wino
Research Network,
uh Landscape Data
Commons and a range of
land analysis
platform.
OK.
So landscape
data Commons enables
data informed
management, uh
essentially harmonized
and aggregated uh
upwards of
80,000
rangeland monitoring
plots across the US
West. And so
these uh could
be used to produce standardized
indicators and metrics
of rangeland
condition.
Excuse me.
Uh The National Wind erosion
Research Network
is a standardized
network across the West uh
where we do very
targeted monitoring
and measurements to look at wind
erosion and ecosystem
trends.
Two
uh and AERO
model uh provides
plot level estimates
of uh wind
erosion. So
horizontal sediment
flux and dust
emission
and we can use
this
with the in
concert. So we can
use
the
research networks
to inform
models and when you can
use monitoring data
to produce products
across the West. Uh
based on model
results,
uh This allows us to look
at different relationships
among win erosion estimates
and indicators and uh assess
impacts of management
actions.
Yeah.
So some critical
needs in terms of
research for
uh wind erosion and
vegetation interactions
or to extend networks
of monitoring uh
away from population
centers into source areas
so that we can uh
connect the two.
There's a a pretty
large disconnect between
those that do research
on dusty mission and dusty
mission processes and then
monitoring air quality,
you know, where it
impacts uh people.
Uh also
dust on snow is
a a fairly large topic
and critical for the four corners
region. So uh
research is needed
there to look
at source areas and
possible mitigation
tactics.
Um We also
need more
research into rangeland
vegetation change
and to identify important
thresholds. Uh so
that we're able to assess
risk
and we need to look at
both extreme events
which everybody is familiar
with that are highly visible
as well as more
pervasive uh high
frequency, low magnitude
events and
also be able
to anticipate
change and make no
regrets decisions uh
before we get to a point
where, you
know, reach some critical
threshold. >> So
>> that
>> thank you for that. Uh
Next up Matthew
Hertel.
>> Uh Thank you, Mr Chair and
members of the committee. My name is
Matt Hertzel. I'm a professor in Biology
at University of New Mexico and
Director of the Center for fire resilient
ecosystems and society.
Um Before I get
into this, I want to give you the punchline
of what I'm here to talk about today and
that's that there's no future in
New Mexico without wildfire
smoke. Uh And
the only thing we can influence
is the dose of smoke
that people experience.
Um So we can do that by managing
vegetation uh
primarily with fire
and developing adaptation
strategies that include air
purifiers that we
deploy to
sensitive community members in
rural New Mexico when wildfire
smoke degrades their air quality.
Next slide, please.
Um So wildfire smoke
is really a function of
the area burned and the amount
of vegetation that's consumed
per unit area.
So there's ample evidence
of warming atmosphere,
increasing fire season
length in the, in the western
US here in New
Mexico, uh we've increased
by about 100 days on
average fire season length
since the 19 seventies,
higher temp temperature
d out making
it more flammable. And
recently, we've looked at forest
area burned and
the relationship with the drying
atmosphere and that's what that graph
is. And it basically
shows an exponential increase
in the area of forests burned
across the west
with increasing
atmospheric dryness. So
the punchline there is that
the 2022 fire
season, which was pretty record
setting for New Mexico
is going to become fairly
normal in the future as
the atmosphere continues to warm and
dry. Next slide,
please.
So the same conditions
that uh that
make the fire season length
increase are also
killing lots of vegetation.
Uh So the, the
pictures aren't showing up real well,
but that's the Pecos Wilderness
1999 on the left.
2020 on the right.
And you know, if
you squint, I
guess given the clarity,
uh the one on the right shows a lot of
dead trees. Um
And you know that has everything to do
with drought and insects.
Uh something we're seeing increasingly
across the west. Uh
And next slide,
please,
basically, you know, those
dead trees are contributing
to the fuel problem.
And so as the climate
warms and more of this dead
vegetation
exists on the
landscape because of
drought and insects.
Um we see more of that
veg is also available
to burn as it dries out.
And so that figure on the right
is one where we looked at
uh dead wege
over a 10 year period.
So those are plots that were measured
at two different time points, the early
two thousands and then the
2012 to 16
for a wildfire that occurred
in 2020 in Colorado.
And, and what those points are
showing is that there are a hell of a lot
more dead trees
in that latter measurement
period. Um
And that's a significant problem
from a a fuel
perspective. Next slide,
please. So
fortunately, there's something we can do
about that and that's functionally
forest management, right? So
that equates to smoke
management. So we can manage
the amount of fuel on the
landscape. We can
manage the structure of that
fuel, we can
manage the timing of ignition
with prescribed burning and we
can manage the area that's
burned by
intentionally lighting
fires across the
landscape at
times that we're likely
to achieve the outcomes that
we're hoping to achieve.
Next slide, please.
So a colleague and I did
some work back
in 2010 where we
looked at the
potential reduction
in wildfire emissions
or fire emissions,
had fire footprints
detected with satellite imagery
be prescribed burns.
So basically
reducing the amount of vegetation
that's consumed. And for New Mexico,
it would have been a 37%
reduction in the amount of emissions
from those fire footprints.
Next slide, please.
So, uh we've done some
work in the Santa Fe fires
shed, looking at
different forest management
scenarios and what this figure
shows is the difference
in those emissions from
high severity wildfire
over that fires shed footprint
uh where we ran simulations
out through the middle of this century.
And so they're subtracting from
a no management scenario which is
why they're negative. And
the punchline here is that if
we restore frequent
fire to these forests through
mechanical thinning
and prescribe burning, we
can significantly reduce the amount
of emissions that are happening
particularly in
large doses. Next
slide, please.
So, uh I've
got a statement up here
that I paraphrased from a
paper published by a bunch of
health researchers. And
so the, you know,
basically,
um what we're
facing is a
problem of dosage
when it comes to smoke. And
so prescribed fire
typically occurs when
ventilation is high.
So we're we're projecting
that smoke up higher in the atmosphere
where it's less impactful.
Whereas wildfires tend to
occur under the most extreme
conditions and that wildfire smoke
will settle in and
degrade air quality heavily.
And that matters because
as this meta analysis
shows there's
a 0.25%
increase in respiratory
emergency department
visits. I'm
sorry, in respiratory
hospitalizations for
every 1 mcg
per cubic meter in
in particulate matter.
So the PM 2.5
and 10 that the
other folks were talking about,
you know, that's a big constituent
species in wildfire
smoke and it's
also what causes most of
the negative health consequences
for humans.
Next slide,
please.
So there's no future where
our landscapes are not flammable
in New Mexico. Anyone who tells
you that we can manage smoke impacts
by putting out wildfire is
delusional because
there's ample evidence as
we see in our state where
100% suppression
is not effective. We lose
wildfires under the most extreme
conditions. They burn large
and they burn fast and
they burn hot and they produce a lot
of smoke. The science
shows however, that we can
manage the amount of smoke
produced by
altering vegetation.
Um We can also
manage uh the amount
of smoke produced by
at any given
time, by lighting those fires
on our terms through prescribed
burning. We also
need to implement uh
adaptation
strategies
that allow people who
live in rural communities
in order to, to deal with the
degraded air quality that occurs
especially during
significant wildfire
events. And one way to do that
that's worked in a number of places
is, you know,
deploying air
purifiers to folks
who cannot afford to purchase
them on their own, that
can help reduce part
matter indoor in
their, in their house.
So, um
there's a number of examples out there
that we can draw from. And, uh I
think that, you know, those are kind
of the 22 things
that I would leave you with is that uh
more, more management on the
landscape to deal with fuels
and uh you know, better
adaptation strategies.
Thank
you.
>> Thank you for that. I think that's
everyone um
going to the committee
uh
percept we
represents.
>> Thank you, chair and thank you very
much for your presentation.
Thank you for
um
giving us an enormous amount
of data. I understand the
purpose of the committee
was to really uh
be very
clear
about this
um
overwhelming problem
of, of drought and
environmental. I do
appreciate our
last presenter and I have some
questions for
the presenter
for the American Lung Association
on some just very
basic. What can we
do
immediately? And you were
talking about air pur
purifiers for that.
I have just been told recently
that if you are in a
community with a wildfire,
that something as simple as
a 95 mask
can take away.
Is that all or most
of the particulars that are
in your
presentation?
>> This one's for me, Mr
chair representative.
Yes. Um obviously
during the wildfire and
especially those with compromised
lung issues, we want to make sure
that they're protected, so
properly fitted
N95
mask would help them. The
cloth masks that
we were all wearing during the pandemic
would not filter out that
tiny, tiny particle of
2.5. So
that would be
one way for
them to protect themselves. Yes.
>> Well, and I appreciate
that, I appreciate
the, the
intention of this
committee but,
um, having some,
just some immediate
guidance of how the
legislature might be able
to provide
this
kind of equipment, whether it's
indoor air
filtration system
or bug
out bags that have something
as immediate in a
presentation earlier
today. You know, we
had a story of a nine year
old that,
that died because of breathing
in. And that is not something
that air quality is not something
that we are addressing
and being able to give
individuals
something that is very
manageable and affordable.
Even the air filtration
systems are
affordable compared
to the high
medical costs
of respiratory
disease. And
so I,
I thank you for answering
those questions.
And um and
once again, I understood
the bigger picture, but
this is at least we can
handle in a more short term
way. Thank
you.
Thank you, Representative K
Senator
Stewart.
>> Thank you, Mr
Chairman.
I don't know about the rest of
you, but after all day,
I'm getting a little depressed
about state affairs
here.
Um
And I'm gonna
take advantage of having a
cabinet secretary
before us to ask
a couple of questions.
You know, my questions are
around
having a sense
of urgency
to move forward.
We've heard just fantastic
presentations from
fantastic experts
who know what they're doing
and who are suggesting
what we do
to try
to solve this
problem.
Uh I haven't
heard, I
haven't heard any
aha ideas.
Most of the
advocates end by
saying, and please
try to fund our state
agencies with
enough people to
do this work.
That's what is almost
on every one of their lists.
So, uh
I'm gonna ask uh
Secretary Kinney this
question this came about
because uh
Donna Bahar,
did I get that right?
Uh Said, you know, we
only have seven
staff to collect this
state. So
here's my question and
I'll give it to you as
a multiple
choice.
So
when it comes to staffing,
uh these departments
uh
is it
that a,
the governor asked you to do a
flat budget and you can't ask
for what you need?
Is it b
we're not paying enough to
get good people?
Is it c
we can't find good
people that will do this
work? Is
it? Um,
let's see. I had another one I
had ad
and then e was all of the
above. We try to
remember Ed.
Um
Oh, yes. Are
you sick of going before the
money people? Where all they
say is, what's your vacancy
rate when you ask for more
people? So
I'm assuming it's e am I
correct?
>> Uh Mr Chair
and Senator,
um,
thinking of all of the
options,
>> I can go over them again if you need
>> that. I, I believe
um I'm,
I'm gonna give you an answer.
It is
largely
e but can I
explain one piece of
that when it
comes to air
quality?
Uh, our air
quality program does
not receive
any general fund
for
employees.
Um So
we are raising our air
quality permitting fees.
That's the proposal before the Environmental
improvement Board right now
to create
a bureau that goes from
70 to roughly 100 and
40 people
so that we can tackle the challenges
with urgency.
Um I think in answering
your question and by
saying all of the above,
I would strike that we can't
find people if that was an option
because we actually our
last rapid hire for
40 positions. We had
three hun 200 people
show up.
So we have
no shortage of New Mexicans who want to
work at the Environment Department who are
very qualified. Actually,
we have no shortage of people around the country
who want to move to New Mexico to work at
the Environment Department. To be quite honest
with you. >> What's the hold
up then,
>> Mr Chair, Mr Chair and
Senator right
now, we have
170
budgeted positions. I have not
one single office to put them
in. So we're going through an RFP to
get more office
space. Um
And I know that may sound
odd considering I was
one of the agencies before you asking
for you guys to fund office
space. But because
we for
various reasons in running a more
efficient organization from
the last session where the legislature
gave us money to appropriately
place our employees,
we are generating
more internal revenue
and are now able to fund our
leases. >> Well,
Mr Chairman and Mr
Secretary, you know,
I've, I've talked to the
education secretary about
this. He moved
uh a significant
number of his staff
to a building in Albuquerque
and all of a sudden, he has
much less of a vacancy
rate because, you
know, there's 550,000
people that live in Albuquerque.
I've lived here since
1978. I
feel safe.
Uh So have
you thought about a building
somewhere else in
Albuquerque? I'm assuming you
have buildings all over the
state. >> Yeah,
Mr Chair and and
Senator um
we back around the
time we are coming out of the pandemic,
we offered all our employees the
opportunity to live anywhere in the
state that they wanted to.
Uh Certainly Albuquerque was our
growth potential. It remains our growth
potential. We had some employees
move to Clovis and
some employees move up to
Espanola.
Um But certainly
Albuquerque is our biggest
growth area. We
are, we have three buildings in
Alber, two buildings in Albuquerque
right now. We're looking to get a
third.
Um
So
we, we are having
uh some
complaints about our downtown
location because we had
a homicide in the parking
lot and then we also had our
security guard get beat up
recently. But
outside of that, we
have
um
we Albuquerque is our growth
area for sure.
>> So Mr Chairman, I, I'm
just trying to
see where the sense
of urgency
is from
the administration
to do what we need to
do, which give
it's to give money
to fill these positions,
to do these jobs that
you say you want
done and we've
given you the mandate
to do them. Where
is the hold up,
>> Mr Chair and
Senator. It is
right now a matter
of we've converted all
our, our conference rooms
to offices
>> and you're talking about buildings.
Is it buildings
or is it salaries?
Is, you know, we had a climate
bill about four years ago
uh we didn't
work with the governor on it.
The fir came back,
this will cost $52
million because this is the
staff, we will
need to do what you
want. I'm
assuming four years
later, that's still
the same. And
frankly, we're a rich
state. We had
3.64 billion
in new money. Last year,
we had 350 million
more new money. By the end
of June, we're gonna have
the same amount next
year. We all have this
albatross around
our neck. Thanking
oil and gas for giving
us funding at the
same time trying
desperately to keep them
from destroying the
earth. So
surely there
is some way that
the administration and
and your
agency can
make the sense of
urgency so we
can put more people
to work in these
areas. I don't want to talk about
buildings. I want to talk
about the ability
of the administration and
you're part of that
to, to answer
the sense of urgency to
put money on the table
for more people.
How can we do
that?
Yeah,
>> Mr Chair and Senator
II,
I understand
your
>> sense of >> urgency. I do understand
your sense of urgency. You and I have talked
about that sense of urgency
and um
you know, one of the things about
running an agency is
that urgency
is curbed by our ability
to move quickly on
things like
yes.
Um
and while
we are pushing
as hard as we can to expand
our footprint to
recruit people
and, and we are filling
pe well, I mean, I, we
have some things that are going to come to the
legislature to thank them from
my employees about the appropriate
placement that, you know,
we've gone from as an
agency and I don't want to make this a budget
hearing per se, but we've gone
as I go around the country
from our country around the state,
from Clovis to
um
Farmington, you
know, our employees at the Environment
Department because of what happened
in the last session are
able to move
from renting to buying
houses or family planning
or doing all. And they're telling me these
stories without asking.
So they're coming up and they're
super excited, they're more
motivated than they've ever
been. Um, our
Climate Bureaus, Donna just
showed me as 100%
staffed right now. We're creating
more positions to work there.
Um But when it comes to the
air
quality
topics that we've talked
about and our ability to be nimble
and reactive and, and
reduce those air
quality pollutants and implement
things like clean fuels that you
yourself helped us pass.
Um We, we
just, we
have no shortage of people wanting to work
there. We just need quicker
processing to get them in the
door. >> Well,
and Mr Chair, mister
uh Mr Secretary, I, I
appreciate all this. I liked
working with you. I thought we did
good work to have
that and we're
still studying the
state personnel office at
LFC and coming
up with a
better uh mechanism
of a better pay
grades to pay
our employees. I'm hoping
what we did for the environment
we can do for any other
agencies.
Um But I,
I,
we struggle, I
mean, yeah, you
want us to talk about air quality.
We started
with
overview of current science
policy and monitoring,
then health and economic
impacts, then how to
mitigate climate change,
then heat and public
health. Now we're on air
quality. That's not the only thing
we talked about today.
We talked about your
need for staffing
in every one of these
areas.
So I'll stop talking.
But you know,
I mean, I want us
to do something. I
want us to be known around
the country as look at New
Mexico, they
saw what they needed and
they got the people and
they did the work. You
can't say that about
us right now. Little
tiny steps,
steps where the earth
is burning. So,
ok, I'll stop
talking. Thank you, Mr
Chairman. Thank you, Mr
Secretary.
>> Thank you, Senator
Stewart, Senator
Woods.
>> Well, it's hard act
to follow there,
madam.
So I'm gonna, I'm gonna
take it in a different direction
from that.
We talk about dust in
the air and, and
different things.
And
I was once mister
chair, I was once
at, at the
Parker Ranch in
Hawaii.
And we up on the side of that
mountain, I was up there with the
cowboy and,
and you know, sometimes those stories
get kind of
long and drawn out
as proportional
to how much beer you drink.
But
he told me that the
depth of the soil up on
the side of that mountain was 30 ft
deep.
And he said
that
the theory was that dut
soil came
from a,
a desert
and fell
because of a raindrop
on
Hawaii.
Now, recently
I've read
where there's quite a bit of dust
in the air coming off
of
the Sierra and
Alaska.
And
I know I
always thought that that was
the cause
of some of the tropical storms
and the hurricanes was
that particular dust up in
the air.
But the latest I
read that they thought it might
actually
deter
those
storms.
So when we start talking about
science, sometimes I get very
confused. I'm, I'm a
confused
guy
but I, I
question
the thought
that
the species change
goes on
with climate
change.
How quick do we
expect
the species, the forest
trees
to change? How, how
much have they changed over the
last say 100
years?
What?
Yeah,
Doctor Herzl.
Good to see you in person. Last
time I saw you. We was a
little bit TV, screen.
So it's good to see you again. We
worked on a little project over
in more.
>> Yeah, Mr Chair, Senator
Woods. Nice to see you as well.
Um, so how
quickly specie tree
species turnover is
really gonna dete, depend
on, um,
disturbance. Uh,
so, you know, the
mature trees can actually persist
for quite some time. They can tolerate a
wide range of conditions.
And then, uh, you know,
if disturbance kills those
mature trees, we'll get
species turnover faster
because, you know, they'll
leave the site and there,
you know, the, the juveniles of
that same species can no longer
persist there. So,
it's similar to
what we're finding say with the
2011 lo conscious
fire. Um You know,
we have to go up in elevation
before we can get Ponderosa
pine seedlings to,
to establish. Uh,
whereas they used to
establish about
809 100 ft
lower in elevation. Uh
That, that, that's where
their range used to be. And now we're to
the point because there's no
tree cover and it's hotter and
drier um that they, they
won't establish until we're
that much higher in elevation.
So it's gonna
happen
more slowly
in the absence of stand
replacing disturbance and
faster in the presence
of stand replacing
disturbance.
>> And what will we have come
in to replace those Ponderosa
pines?
>> Uh Mr Chair
Senator, it's, it's gonna
depend in on a
couple of things. One
is if we decide to intervene
with planting, we can,
we can bring species in
that are better capable of, of
tolerating those conditions.
So, you know, pon,
just the whole
Ponderosa pine belt does not
move up lockstep
and elevation, right? Uh
Aspect uh
plays a significant
role in where it will grow.
So, you know, north,
north faces, it's going to grow lower
because they're cooler and wetter. South
faces higher. Um
You know, but if it's,
if a site is no longer
capable of supporting Ponderosa
pine, uh the next
woody vegetation down is
Pinon and Juniper. Um
So you know, those are available.
Uh, we can definitely move
species around in that,
in that manner. We've been doing it
for thousands of
years
>> in the juniper.
Um,
for,
we consider that's a,
an evasing
for over
around Corona.
Um, many times
we try to, we try to
clear those, those
trees out to, to
clear the grasslands,
but it seemed like
they're, they're
encroaching more and more
to me. Is that,
is that the case or
am I all
wrong?
I think
that's one of
your
>> encroachment.
Mr Chair, Senator Woods. Yeah, a
more, uh, a bit more
familiar with the sort of the
Lowen areas and not so much the
juniper, but, uh,
in general, it has been,
uh, increasing
in its range and
considered it invasive.
Yeah. And,
uh, in terms of other woody
plants, uh, the
other large one is mesquite,
obviously that's, uh,
encroaching on a lot of grasslands.
And then, uh,
a lot of the current
conditions, uh,
favor it. It's a
bit more hardy and
does a bit well with more
variability in
precipitation,
mainly in terms of the timing
and the amount of the spacing
in between rate events and,
and those sorts of things favor
it a bit over
grasp.
>> And the concern of
those evasive species
in my eyes
is the amount of,
of, uh, recharge
to the aquifer.
Uh, they seem like they take
out a huge
amount of water
as they
come in
and there's a
lot of, of spraying
that goes on different kind
of removal going
on to try to keep those
evasive species
out.
And
I'd like to make the
point here,
Mr Chair
that
with adequate
moisture,
something's gonna
grow,
that may be an annual, may
not be a problem,
but it's something's gonna
grow And you can
see that
many of you,
uh remember a dust
storm between
here and Santa Fe not
too long ago
that actually stopped
cars. They had a huge
pile of the people,
you know, because
of the dust storm. And if you look
out there right now,
those tumbleweeds are pretty
thick out there,
something's gonna grow when
there's adequate moisture that comes
along.
The, the, the
annuals are
the first thing that happened.
But as
that,
if it's managed
and adequate moisture will,
then the perennials
will come back.
How long,
how much of this,
uh you showed the
pictures of
the Horna where,
where management
was going on there
and, and
it was managed to
the, the amount of
grass that was grown to
the cows that were
run. It showed
that you could actually
develop a,
a grassland
where it was a,
a a
for uh uh a
brush
deal as
before. And,
and so
how long does that
process take?
I know that y'all, uh
the college has been
managing Horna for
quite some time.
But when, when
you go over there to
where
there's a lot of vacant
ground. How long
would it take to establish a
grassland there
again?
>> Uh Mr
Chair, Senator Woods,
uh,
it's actually the one I
showed is,
uh, quite
interesting because it's
has taken over where
formerly, uh black Gramma
grassland, but
it's a novel grassland
and that it's uh,
more bunch grass
dominated, but
in terms of dust
and, and aerosols in the air,
it more or less
behaves the same
as the, the native
grasslands.
Um I think the big key
there is
that
you have one or two wet
years to sort of kick it
off and to get things going.
Uh in the absence of
that, uh we
had, for example, one
site we called it the, the scrape
site. We scraped all
the vegetation off some time
ago and it, it
basically would remain bare,
you know, in
perpetuity until you have
something like that. Uh,
that, that allows for that
growth to get started. And
then, of course, once it gets
started, uh,
you know, grasses that trap
nutrients and other things that are,
that are blown along and, you
know, sort of self
reinforcing uh
on the other way
to go from grassland
to uh sort
of an invaded shrubland.
Um But it, it,
it can't happen
fairly quickly with
disturbances, uh depending
on the type of vegetation. But,
uh mesquite in this case, is a pretty
slow growing
shrub. So,
you know, in the order of a, a
couple
decades for the
transition.
>> Well, I was gonna get into a
more lengthy conversation
about how
soil was built, but
I guess I'll pass on that
one. I thank you very
much.
>> Thank you, Senator Woods. Um,
so I have a couple of questions.
Uh, first off for
Miss,
um, would you happen to
know the air quality in
Farmington or San Juan
County?
>> I would need to look at
our back to
our report. I will say for
San Juan County,
they measure
ozone, but there
is not a monitor for particle
pollution. Actually,
only nine
counties in
Mr Chair should start with that.
Only nine counties
in New Mexico out of the
33 monitor
ozone and only five
counties monitor
PM two point
five
>> is that >> uh
that's due to, you know,
where
funding and
where, you know EPA
works with state, local
tribal governments and decides
where monitors go.
So when we talk
about our report and we talk about
this huge burden air pollution
has. We're really only seeing
a small picture of what
the air pollution burdens really
are because, and that's
across the country.
There's not enough air quality
monitors.
>> OK. Thank you for
that. Uh Some years ago,
Farmington had a good
uh I think it was from the
American Lung Association said
they had very clean air
and then
we kept hearing about
that even though
subsequent reports said,
oh, wasn't that
clean? Kept going
back to the original report that was
clean and so nothing
needed to ever be done
because there was
clean. So like having
the information
that could be, that could be
useful. Uh
Mr Edwards,
um you said that
there
um
there was some effective
treatments of, of
dust by doing like
landscape restoration
that that proved effective.
Um
My question is,
can you do that on a wide
scale? I I
mean, I do, it doesn't
surprise me, you can do it on a
small scale experimental
scale. But if you're
talking about New Mexico, if we're talking about
the West,
um
are there options
for truly
landscape scale
restoration?
>> Uh Mr Chair? So
there's uh
there, there are options and
there, there are ongoing efforts by
a number of agencies that,
that go towards that.
Um
The success rate is
variable, you know, depending
on the, the
sort of the
pre-existing conditions and
then what happens after.
And I think a lot of it has to do
with uh
the timing that you do
it and then a lot of the
stuff. Uh there's a lot of
uncertainty
uh for instance,
if uh
herbicide, you
know, it's selective for
shrub removal, for instance, if
you do it at the wrong time of the
year and then you have
nothing left and then all
your what nutrients
there are in the topsoil,
you know,
might blow away.
So a lot of those things
have to be considered in that
process. But if there,
there are
a number of efforts and can
be had with moderate success,
you know, to manage it. I think
one of the largest things is
to, uh,
minimize
disturbance
while,
uh, sort of
balancing the ecosystem
services,
you know, that you extract from
the
land.
>> And I appreciate that. I, I
guess
what, what I'm thinking
is,
I mean, we do a lot of restoration
work and it's
acre by acre.
But if we're talking
about
sections,
you know,
dozens, you
know, maybe hundreds of sections
like how,
how do we address
that? If, if, in
fact, we, we get to the state
where,
you know, we're losing our vegetation,
we're creating dust that dust carries
for, uh,
I mean, carry for 100
hundreds of miles.
You know, how do we,
how do we address
that?
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. I think,
uh,
on a
scale,
uh, at
that size, I think it
becomes a much more difficult
proposition.
Um,
yeah, it's a little
bit out of biro
but,
uh,
yeah, the, the cost would
be fairly high. So,
>> so I, I'm,
I guess I wasn't,
uh, I wasn't
really expecting a hopeful an
answer
that,
um, and, and,
uh, Mr
Drel, um,
you talked about reducing Emmi
emissions uh through
fire management. And is
that
when, when you talk about reducing
emissions, are you talking about
the overall emissions
or just the intensity of
the emissions?
>> Yeah, Mr Chair, I'm talking about
reducing the intensity of
emissions at, at one point in
time. So that, that fuel
that's out there, the surplus fuel
is going to have to be removed
or combusted in some way, shape or
form. And we can either
do it all in one fell swoop
with a high severity wildfire kind
of chip away at it through
management.
>> Ok. So I, I've
had constituents
who are sensitive to
smoke. Call
me, email
me, text me very
upset at the prescribed
burns
and,
you know, my feeling
is
if we don't do the
prescribed burns, we're gonna have the
catastrophic fires.
Um,
and, and I'm sympathetic
that they're, they're being
impacted by
relatively low level
burns and yeah, we've had a couple
prescribed burns that
haven't, you know, they've gone
fine, but the wind is
shifted, right. So
you'll have prescribed
burns in Sane National
Forest and the wind shifts
unexpectedly and
it's, you know, it's
all over the city of San.
Um,
and I, you know, in my
mind, we're better off
doing it that way, but
that's a hard sell when,
when you're talking to someone
who's impacted by even that
low level of
smoke.
Any thoughts, comments,
suggestions. >> Yeah, Mr
Chair II,
I appreciate that.
You know, it's absolutely
true that any, you know, any,
any amount of smoke is, is
bad for people. Right. That's
all there is to it. But it's when your
choices are, you can control the
dose, the amount of
particulate matter that people are breathing
in at any given time when that's
your only option. I think, you
know, that's what we're we're facing
in this case. Um Our
landscapes are
incredibly flammable. You can look
back at, you know,
uh uh early accounts of
the first European settlers
in the southwest and
people sending their Children
away during the summer because it was
so smoky, their wives and
kids. You know, and,
and you know, the
early photographs showing
big smoke columns across the
landscape. I mean, we live in a
flammable environment. I don't, there's
no way to change that and
so all we can do is is
manage, uh, you
know how that flammability
impacts us.
>> Ok? Um
Thank you all very much.
Um I think that was a very good
mail.
Um Our
next, uh and final
panel for the day
is waste reduction,
recycling and producer
responsibility. So
I'll give you just a minute for everyone
to swap
seats.
Ok. We got, we got some
people who had to leave
so they're gonna, uh exit
quickly and shut the
door,
hopefully behind
them.
Here we go. Um So,
uh first up we
have Sheleen
Sitton.
Now you gotta push the
button
there. You
>> good afternoon, Mr Chair
and members of the committee.
Um It's
425. I know it's
been a long day and we're
here to pick up the trash at the
end of a big meeting.
So
good job,
I'm Shirlene Sidden. I'm your
new solid waste bureau
chief. So uh
we are hiring,
um I'm new, I have our
new permit section manager with
me today. Um We're
working diligently. We do
have open positions,
but we are working to fill them
and we're really excited
about building a
uh a new
really strong team in the
solid waste Bureau. Um
I come to the bureau with 22
years of municipal
solid waste experience
in collection of
trash and recycling,
recycling programs of
various kinds,
um sustainability
programs and keep it beautiful
programs. So even though
I'm still really learning about how
to be your solid waste bureau
chief, um I hope
that I'm bringing
excitement about new
programs and and new
ways to
increase focus on waste
minimization,
diversion and recycling
market development
within the New
Mexico Environment
Department.
Just a quick overview of our
bureau. We have three
main activities that we do
which is permitting
facilities such as landfills
and transfer stations,
uh recycling facilities,
compost facilities, things
like that.
We do outreach that is
mandated by statute.
And so we do training
and certification classes
which is a great um
opportunity for us
to keep infusing
new ideas about
waste diversion and
recycling in different ways for
waste management. Um
It's a great opportunity and I'm really
glad to be able to be a part of that.
And of course, we do enforcement
to make sure people are
adhering to their,
uh, their permits
and the rules
around safe management
of solid waste and
recycling
next slide. Thank you.
Just a quick,
I know you've, uh, you've seen this
ask before. Um,
but we're, we're
hoping we'll be asking it again
this year. The
Solid Waste Bureau is the bureau.
It's my understanding they were the
most reliant on general
fund. There is a
$10,000 cap
on permitting
fees within
NM AC And it's
30 years old and it's
really out of date. And just for
perspective, it takes
about $6000 of
that 10 just to
do the public notice
right off the bat.
So we've uh,
our, uh, the Bureau has
come before the legislature
before asking to change
that. But the thing that's
different this year
is I'm coming with
um many
years of being actively
involved in solid waste
recycling advocacy groups.
And so we're already working with the
two main groups
to make
sure that we go into the legislative
session with that support
and that we'll know what the
rulemaking process, what,
what, what kinds of
fees that we might be
looking at. And,
um, the, the group
that's helping me does
represent both the public and private
sector.
Next slide, please. Ok, you got
it.
Well, I'm really excited to tell
you about our solid waste Swiffer
grant. So, uh
we were awarded
um about
$570,000
to update our solid waste
management plan, which
was last updated in
2015.
Um And so, uh through
that, we'll be able to, we're,
we're not quite staffed up and
up to handle such a big project,
but we will be able to hire
consultants that will
help us arrange
input through public
meetings, um with our stakeholder
groups and the regulated community.
We'll be able to really
update our solid waste
characterization methods
and we really need to
improve our recycling
data gathering. We just don't have
good data and that
that's not unique. New Mexico hasn't
failed in any way. Recycling
data is really hard to
get. But
um I know that
there's I've and I've worked in other
places on ways to improve that
data gathering and
recycling data is very
important because again,
recycling is economic
development. And in
order to have robust recycling
programs, we need to know
what we're doing and where the gaps
are. And
when we come out with a new solid waste
management plan, of course, it'll
emphasize safety, which is
really the most important thing
in solid waste management.
Um It'll emphasize
training and circular
economy programs.
So what does that mean?
And next slide.
So a circular economy
really refers to how
we can utilize
recycling as
a feedstock
for um
continuing to make new
products. Again,
economic development
jobs, it's a win,
win for the environment
and the economy.
And so we want to
keep things as local as
possible. It's much better for the
environment when we
have something that we can do
locally where we can make
new products and we
can encourage new
businesses, new
and old doesn't matter.
Um to, to look at new
and creative ways to manage
those things. And so that we
keep those natural
resources because that's what we're
using, whether it's
paper, petroleum,
um all the things that make our products
and packaging, we keep those
natural resources
cycling through
and we reduce the need to
keep mining
or cutting down or
extracting more natural
resources.
So some of the things that
we expect to
study and update in our
solid waste management plan,
there's a bunch of bullets
here. Every one of
these could be an hour long
presentation. But
um we definitely want to look at
improving access to recycling,
especially in rural
areas.
Um Again, economic
development for recycling
commodities and feed
stocks, uh
how to assess
composting on a statewide
um way and
uh perform some gap
analysis. And I'll mention
that the N MD A has
currently got
an RFP out on the
street for a statewide
composting plan. And so I'm partnering
with them. And so we're
hoping to really help each other
out and um both be able
to use the data.
We definitely, um
everywhere we go,
the, the, the question of
problem plastics like single-use
bags always comes up.
So that will be something we'll be looking
at um
disaster, debris management.
So 3, 3.5 months
on the job and now we have
a big disaster and it was
something I wasn't
even
knowledgeable about how
we would manage that debris.
And so that is
really a big question that we're,
we're grappling with, how can we do
better with managing
the debris from, from
fires or other natural
disasters?
Um, and then, um,
the thing that is near and dear to
my heart and I wanted
to give, uh,
Senator Stewart her
aha moment is extended
producer responsibility.
Um,
I will talk about that a little
more in a minute and my colleague,
Sarah Pierrepont will talk about it a
little more. Um But
that is uh that is something
is touched on in our current plan
and we're really hoping to
expand and
that, that will
be our next slide and go ahead
and go to the next
slide.
So, extended producer
responsibility is an environmental
policy approach that holds
producers responsible
for product management
through the product's life
cycle. I mentioned
I spent 22 years in
municipal solid waste,
managing landfills
um doing the collection,
finding recycling programs,
working in public private partnerships
to establish materials
recovery
facilities.
The thing is
manufacturers come up with
new products every
day and,
and that's great. We all want new
products. We all want the newest
and best working thing, but
sometimes those products really
contain toxic ingredients where
they change the packaging of the
products without
telling anyone and then they put
a recycling symbol on
it and it's not
recyclable. And if you've ever been
to a materials recovery
facility, that's
the place they sort out all of the
stuff that when you put it in your
curbside cart and
it's picked up, that's where it goes
and it gets sorted out. Those
are multimillion dollar
investments and
the technology that goes
into the machines that sort the
equipment, this is
all this takes a long
time, many years and large
investments to get online.
So when packaging is suddenly
changed and there's nothing to
sort that packaging out
or no way to recycle
it. That's a big glitch
in the recycling program.
So we
look at extended producer
responsibility as a way to
say, hey, you're,
you're making this, but
we are ending up, we
consumers, local
governments, we are
all ending up having to
pay for the end of life
of that product
indefinitely.
Um You know, whether
it's immediately for the disposal
of the product uh or
for monitoring it in a landfill
for forever.
Rira says 30 years because
that was their best guess at the time,
but it's forever 30
years as landfills just
cranking up. So,
um we need to do better
across the board about
creating products and
packaging that can
go back into that circular
economy and
reduce the burden of the end
of life, management of that of
that product.
So in looking at
what the big problems
are in New Mexico
and taking a swipe and
my first time out the gate at
an extended producer responsibility
bill, I'm really
looking at tires
when um
when we talk to people, tires
are a huge focus
as, as I come into this
job. Um,
I observe right, that
our Raid Grants and I'll talk
about those a little
bit later. Um, two
thirds of the money for Raid grants
go to tire management.
Just tires.
That's about $500,000
a year.
We have a job called
tire coordinator.
We don't have an aluminum
can coordinator
or a newspaper
coordinator. We have a
tire coordinator. It's the only
named commodity job
because it is such an enormous
issue, not just in New
Mexico, but all over the country.
It's, we're not alone, but it is an
enormous issue in New
Mexico. So
we are, um, we are working with
the governor's office, uh
to, um, to
work on a, a tire
bill uh for New
Mexico. And one of
the reasons I'm really excited about that
is because the State of Connecticut
has just implemented the, the
really the country's first real
tire E pr law.
And what that means is
that the tire producers
then have to take part
in, um setting
up some kind of take back
organization and
finding ways to recycle
or reuse the tires because
who can better do that
than the manufacturers.
So I'm, I'm really excited
about that. It's, it's
sometimes better not to be the first
as I'm sure you, you probably
all know. So, um,
they're, they're working on that
implementation and I'm trying
to learn from them. And so
I'm hoping that might be something of,
of interest to the legislature this
year. Ok. Next
slide.
Um Just another uh uh
another word about
our raid grants, that's the recycling
and illegal dumping.
Um And uh
again,
so much of it goes to tire
management and there's just
three projects that were awarded
this year um
for dump site
abatement. It
kind of gives you an across the,
across the border look
because tires are dumped all
over the state. Um
The town of Taos has an
enormous tire
stockpile, but it's at their landfill.
They were legally brought there,
but now, now they're
trying to manage them.
Um, and then the city of
Clovis trying to do
something with tires
and, and doing a playground
rubber mulch program. There's
not a whole lot we can do with tires
and that's one of the things. So
there's just some examples
of, of how,
um, how we're working with
tires in the state. Ok.
That,
all right. Um
The Solid Waste Bureau is
beautiful. We're beautiful. Trash
is beautiful. Um
We, we know that literary and
illegal dumping are a problem in New
Mexico as we just discussed
about the Raid grants.
Um I don't know if
you're aware, the New Mexico Tourism's
clean and beautiful grants are
a sister, sister
grants to the Raid Grants.
And um coming
from local government, I can tell you
it's generally the same people
and entities that apply for both
grants. And
uh, so we're, we
uh we want to work together,
we've met with their committee.
Um We want to see
how we can make sure we're
amplifying and complementing
efforts across the board.
So we can really tackle
the litter, the litter
problems, the illegal dumping
problems and make sure
that we're supporting each other
and um
um doing the best
we can with the funds that we
have. Um next
slide.
Ok. This is my last
slide.
Um Again, I just wanna, I
wanna recap um
what our, what our proposals,
what our as will, will, will
be um to you in the coming
months and that will
be removing that $10,000
cap and letting us
modernize the
way that we
uh that we're able to
handle permitting in those things
through the rulemaking process,
the tire responsive, uh tire
extended producer responsibility.
Um And I just, I mentioned this
non-essential P FSS ban. It's
not something I'm, I
personally it's not,
I'm working on but it
within my division.
Um But as
these pfos bans are coming
online in other states,
they, they can have an enormous
impact on products
and packaging
um whether
intentionally or
unintentionally and
um that,
that similar impact that extended
producer responsibility might
have. So be, be looking
for that and asking questions about
that and with that,
I'll say thank
you.
>> Ok, thank you very
much. Um Sarah
Pierpont.
>> Thank you, Mr chair
members of the committee. My name is Sarah
Pierpont. I am the Executive
director of the New Mexico Recycling
Coalition. We are a
statewide members supported
nonprofit and our mission is to
inspire New Mexicans
to rethink reduce
reuse and recycle.
Going to go to the next slide,
please. So as
the head of the recycling Coalition, I'm
here to tell you that recycling is not
broken. Recycling works
really well for most commodities,
aluminum steel,
tin, high
value plastics like number one and
two cardboard paper.
But the problem with the the
bad wrap or getting the recycling is
a of those low value
plastics and that
status quo is not working
out of the 35 million
tons of plastic waste that are
responsibly responsibly
disposed of each year,
less than 10% is
recycled and less than
3% stays in the United
States. I do
not feel comfortable that the recycling
that is sent out of country
is managed responsibly.
I think there's no way to know that for
sure. And so we can
do a lot better. And
unfortunately, recycling
has been used by
um industry to
essentially green wash
their systems and what their
products are. That label
that Shirlene mentioned that's put on
everything. There's no
rules
about who can put that label on.
What next slide,
please. So we
got together with our members.
We had over 70 people attend
a annual meeting training that
we had in Albuquerque. Last
month, we represented 45
communities and we asked the
boots on the ground. Recyclers and
solid waste professionals.
What items drive you
crazy in your job. What is your biggest
headache causing
item? And this is their answers.
Um Along with what they
propose, the policy should,
should be done to address
these items. Mercury
can devices, they're
very toxic. One,
mercury containing light bulb has
enough mercury in it to
pollute an entire lake, a small
lake. Yet these are the things that our
recycling professionals
have broken around them. I
have to manage. So,
a simple sales ban like the state of
California has done in a couple of other
states just to ban the sale
of new mercury containing light
bulbs. There's an easy
solution. Now there's led
light bulbs, lithium
ion batteries, the
recyclers and solid waste folks
don't like these because they cause
fires. They're dangerous.
They're hard to know where they are.
They're so small. They would like
to see them banned from landfills.
Um Styrofoam
food containers.
This is something that is a
very high contaminant in the
recycling stream.
Styrofoam is plastic.
We educate our residents
to recycle plastic. They see
that and they put it in the
recycling bin and it's a really
big costly contaminant.
So they wanted to see some
ways to limit the sales of some
styrofoam food containers,
mattresses this might be a surprise
to a lot of you. But mattresses are the
bane of many solid waste folks
existence. Mattresses.
First of all, they're highly illegal,
illegally dumped and they
float. If you're in a landfill,
they kind of float to the top and they can
hide pockets and,
and holes that are dangerous for
drivers to drive over the
springs get caught in the gears.
Like a mattress spring can take
down one of those giant landfill
bulldozers.
So they wanted to see a system in
place where the mattress producers
were responsible for
managing that product at the end of
its life tires, as
Shirlene mentioned
and then plastic packaging,
the solutions that the boots
on the ground recyclers in New Mexico
thought of for plastic packaging
would be an E PR
program for paper
and plastic packaging or sales
ban of some of the most egregious
items. Next slide,
please. So this is
just a kind of reminder of where we are with
the plastic, the plastics
that we are seeing and managing right
now. Um Most of
them have been made in the last 15
years. If the plastic
industry were a country, it would be the world's
fifth largest producer of greenhouse
gasses. And this is I'm
just putting this up to kind of
reiterate that this is not changing.
The plastics production will double
by 2050
it will account for about
20% of the global oil
consumption. So the plastic
waste crisis is, is
very much linked to the climate waste
crisis. Go ahead and next
slide.
So we know plastic
production is not going to slow
down anytime soon.
We know it's linked to the climate,
climate crisis. And right
now in New Mexico, this
is a map of our recycling
system. We have something
that the state should be very proud
of. It's called a hub and spoke
rural recycling system
where the smaller
um it bitty, you
know, small towns serve with the
spokes that feed into the
hubs. In the past
five years, many of our hubs have
had to had to shut down
because of the changes in commodity
prices, the pandemic, whatever
it may be. I know
representative Ortez
from Taos County who knows a lot about
this. Um Taos has
shut down their robust
recycling center and so
now the entire counties is just, has
one small vertical bale
Baylor that is operated by two
or three really diligent
recyclers. But my point
is that uh
if you want to recycle
plastic in New Mexico, most
communities can't even do
it. Next slide,
please. Yeah,
as I mentioned this picture,
you see behind there, that is
the,
the waste or the discards
from the materials recovery
facility in Albuquerque.
Those are all of the things that were put
into the recycling bin
by Albuquerque
residents, you know, wanting to
recycle that didn't belong
there in the first place.
80% of that is a single
use plastic bag.
The single use plastic bags
are the top contaminant in
Albuquerque and in most areas
of the country in recycling
programs and they
serve as tanglers. What that
means is they
physically get stuck in
the gears and the systems of those
big multimillion dollar
processing facilities
so much so that they have to completely
shut down the plant for about
two hours a day,
clean out all that material. Just
so their equipment and their staff
can work safely. And
it's estimated it costs about
$4 million per year in
expenses just for Albuquerque to
remove those tanglers. Go ahead next
slide.
So we talked a little bit
about recycling
and plastics and I know
you wanted to also address litter.
Um One thing that
is being done at a global level
is called brand audits.
Over 250
brand audits have taken place in
41 countries. They've looked
at over a half a million pieces
of plastic and they
know who the big polluters are.
It's Coca Cola, Pepsico,
Nestle Mandela
and Unilever. These are the big
polluters and why do we
care? Why do we need to know this?
Because if you're trying to go to a
system where the polluter
pays, whether that's,
you know, carbon credits
or that's extended
producer responsibility, you
have to know who those polluters are.
So if you take that information to the Coca
Cola stakeholders meeting, they
might be more interested to
join a producer responsibility
program. Next
slide in the
US, we have a similar
study that doesn't look at exactly
the brands, but it's run by Keep
America. Beautiful. It's their annual
litter study. They
look throughout the
roadways and waterways
of the United States
and some of the top pollutants
in the Keep America. Beautiful litter
study are those
single use packaging. There's a lot of
fast food packaging,
film like
chip bags, all those things that
really they're made out of
aluminum paper, plastic,
they're not recyclable
and then single use plastic
bags. Next
slide. Ok.
So as Shirlene
mentioned, the beautiful
thing is we don't have to recreate the wheel.
There's a lot of proven things that
other states have done and
they are knocking on the door ready to
help because they want
to um they want to see this grow,
especially neighbors like Colorado that
are so close regionally.
Colorado passed a
producer responsibility
program for recycling.
What that means is if you want
to sell a product in a
paper or plastic
packaging container
to a resident in
Colorado, you must
be involved in their producer
responsibility organization
and you must pay into that
organization based on
how toxic
or hard to recycle or
pain in the neck. Your packaging
is, it's called eco modulation.
If you have a piece of
paper, very recyclable
that's wrapped, you know, your gum is wrapped
in a piece of paper that that's a
low fee if you have a
juice box, that's everything all
mixed together, that's a higher
fee. And then that
Producer Responsibility
Organization will pay for
100% of all the
recycling in the state of
Colorado.
So there you
go.
Next slide, California
did something similar, but they took
it a step further. They're
requiring that the Producer
Responsibility Organization
will put in $5 billion
over 10 years. And they're also going to
require that those, that
money is targeted towards
communities that have been disadvantaged
or low income and rural
and have had the biggest impacts
based on plastic waste.
And they're requiring that the
state cuts its plastic
use by 25%
um encourages that
those packages that are sold in the
state, they must reach
a higher percentage of recyclable
and recyclable
content, recycled
content. And then it also
make sure that all the packaging
will be recyclable or
compostable.
Next slide.
I just wanted to touch
on this about
a single product like
Sherlene mentioned if, if
the state were to start with tires,
most states did not
start with a
comprehensive packaging.
E pr bill, most
states started with one or two
commodities that are the
most egregious, whether that
is the mattresses or the
tires, as Shirlene mentioned
or paint
or carpet
and out of the
United States, 32 states
have some sort of extended
producer responsibility
program right now
on the books and there's over 100 of those
programs and it's just growing
every year
next slide.
Another effective tool
to improve our
recycling
and reduce litter
is sales bans banning
some of the most hard to manage
material, banning,
banning those single use plastic
bags. Um
There's a company that that
runs the recycling processing
in Santa Fe. They're called Town
Recycling. They're through a
public private partnership
and Santa Fe has a single
use plastic bag ban
Albuquerque does not. They also have an
operation in Albuquerque. They've
said that it's much easier for them
to sell their material that comes
out of Santa Fe than it
is to sell the material that comes out of
Albuquerque simply
because it doesn't have that
contamination from the single use
plastic bags. And these bans
really do work. They reduce the
amount of litter on the
roadways and the waterways
and they just help
residents get used to a new
system of bringing every
use next slide,
please. Ok.
So what can New Mexico lawmakers
do to help.
I would love and I'm here
to help and, and do a lot of the leg
work to see our state pass
a single use plastic prevention
law that would, would
ban some of the most egregious
single-use plastics such
as single use plastic bags,
polystyrene or styrofoam,
take out food containers,
some of the accessories,
you know, the straws, the
utensils, all those things being
available upon request
that helps meet all of the American
Disabilities guidelines as
well. And just really
kind of think smart about
how we can turn
off the faucet in terms the plastic
waste crisis, Santa
Fe County just passed something
similar to this in ordinance early
this year. And um
it is really a great
way for states to
take a first step in the litter
reduction and the plastic waste
crisis. And there are
12 states right now that have already
passed statewide bans.
Secondly, supporting an E
PR for inaugural
product like tires.
That's believe it or not. It
sounds like it makes a lot of sense, but
there's a lot of people that could fight that
and it's important to get
stakeholder input and to make
sure that we know
how we can benefit New
Mexico and then consider
banning the sales of
toxic, easily,
easily replaced items
such as mercury containing
lightbulbs. It's a safety issue
for all of our recyclers and solid waste
folks. We don't want
mercury breaking around them
anymore. And so it's a simple
solution just phasing out the sale
of that toxic material from the stores
in New Mexico.
I can talk really fast. Thank
you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right. Thank you very
>> much. OK. Thank
you very much. Uh Next up Stephanie
Levy,
you're gonna need a
microphone,
>> Mr Chair,
madam, vice
chair and members of the committee.
My name is Stephanie Levy.
I'm co-founder of
Beyond Plastic, Santa Fe
and a member of Eldorado.
285 recycles.
I'm gonna start simply
plastics equals
fossil fuels plus
chemicals. The
plastics, fossil fuel
and chemical industries are
the most powerful and polluting
industries on earth.
While the tobacco industry
lied to us about the harmful
effects of their
products, they only
harmed a subset of
humanity. The
plastics industry has
harmed every being on the
planet. They brought us
a throwaway mentality
foisted the responsibility
of disposal on to
us the taxpayer
and lied to us about the
feasibility of
recycling.
Excuse me. My, my
topic is about
um the health effects
of microplastic.
The new report but funded
by the Norwegian Research
Council expands the
number of chemicals
found in plastics.
The ones that are known to
16,000.
The authors identified
more than 4200
chemicals of concern which
can potentially persist
in the environment for a very
long time. More
than 1300 of these
chemicals of concern
are known to be marketed
for use in plastics.
The report also highlights
15 chemical priority
groups of concern.
These concern, these
include palates
which are used to make plastics
more durable and have
been found to affect the
reproductive systems
of animals as
well as PFAS,
also known as
Forever chemicals
which break down very
slowly if ever
and have been linked to health
issues, including
reproductive and
developmental problems
and increased cancer
risk. And
now plastic particles,
microplastics and
nanoplastics are
everywhere from the
top of Mount Everest to the
Mariana trench
and in everything in
our air, our water
in our flesh and in our
blood.
According to a world, the World
Wildlife Fund analysis
of plastic ingestion
from the environment to
people. The largest
source of plastic ingestion
is drinking water.
The United States leads
the world in tap water.
Samples containing plastic
particles,
microplastics have been
found not only in human
stool, lungs and
placenta which
have direct exposure to
the external environment
through various bodily
entryways, but
also in enclosed
human organs
such as the heart and
testicles among other
things. Now, never in
my life did I think I
was gonna be speaking
publicly about
testicles? So please
please forgive me
and any uh stammering
I might do
well here at University
of New Mexico. A research
team led by Doctor
Matthew Campen,
analyzing human
placentas found
micro plastics
in all 67
that they studied. The
most prominent polymer
was polyethylene,
which is found in plastic
bags and bottles.
In further reproductive
studies. They measured 12
types of microplastics
in 47 can nine
and 23 human
testes. The
study found microplastics
in all the canine and human
testes examined
with polyethylene being
the most common and
that's the one used in
packaging bags and
other products and can
be found in products labeled
with the number one, number
two and number four
chasing arrow resin
codes,
polyvinyl chloride
PV C uh
also known as
number three plastics
was also detected
and linked with lower sperm
count and decreased
weight of the testicles.
As was pe T
number one plastic.
A study out of China
found microplastics
in the male reproductive
system, including
testes and semen.
So it's clear
an impending fertility
crisis is upon
us. Men have
experienced a 50 to
60 decline percent
decline in sperm clouds
from 1973
to 2011 and
infertility is
increasing. According
to a 2017
study, palates
may be one of the
culprits.
Microplastics
often contain
palates which can leach out of the
material causing endocrine
disrupting effects.
And there's increasing
evidence that developmental
exposure to endocrine
disruptors can
elicit phenotypic
effects, the interaction
of genes with the
environment that are
transgenerational
inherited.
So, in other words, even
if it were possible to
vacuum up all the
microplastics in our
environment along our
roadsides in the
oceans, in our soil,
the plastics now
present in our bodies
will remain and
be transmitted to our
offspring for
generations
along with declining sperm
count. Doctor Campen also
said the growing concentration
of microplastics in
human tissue could
explain puzzling
increases in some
health problems
including in inflammatory
bowel disease and
colon cancer in people
under 50 which
is on the rise.
Another new study found
microplastics in
nearly 90%
of protein food
samples tested
including seafood,
pork, beef, chicken
tofu and several
plant-based meat
alternatives.
Research has documented
microplastics in fruits
and vegetables, salt,
sugar, rice and
milk.
Sherri Mason, a
professor and director
of Sustainability at Penn
State explains
that plastic materials
are a bit like skin,
they slough off pieces
into water or food
or whatever substance they're
touching. We
know at this point that our skin
is constantly shedding.
She said, and this is
what plastic items are
doing. They're just
constantly shedding.
Many of these chemicals are
not sufficiently accessed
for their assess
for their impacts on human
health. While others are
known hazardous
substances,
executives from the plastic
industry are promoting
advanced recycling
as a solution to the plastic
crisis, referring to
various means of melting
down plastic into
simpler petrochemical
gasses and liquids,
some of which could
hypothetically be used
to make more plastic.
In reality, the plastic
industry has no track
record of recycling
plastic. This way at
scale Martin
Burke, Executive
director of the Ecology
Center in Berkeley, California
explains. So
far the method
usually turns plastic
scrap into dirty fuel
and toxic waste.
They're enabling increased
pro production of
plastic under the
guise that it'll be recycled.
When presently it is
not. You'll hear
more about chemical
recycling, pyrolysis,
advanced recycling
and waste to energy.
With the push coming from the
plastics and chemical
industries sounds
good, but these companies
can't even fulfill their
promises for current
non advanced
recycling. As
Sarah pointed out most of
the plastic that we haul to our
curbs isn't recyclable
at all. It ends up
in landfills,
incinerated or shipped
off to developing
countries to be
illegally dumped or
burned. Plastic
recycling has been an
industry created sham
since its conception,
are we gonna trust their newest
solution? Even
energy giant shell
oil has quietly backed
away from its promise
to turn plastic waste
into oil through
pyrolysis. After
five years of investment,
they've deemed the project
unfeasible.
I've included a letter of
support from Doctor
Cen from the for
the new Santa Fe
County Plastic
Reduction Act in
which he suggests
that legislation
is what's needed to help
humanity turn off the
tap and protect human
health. Uh Santa
Fe County passed
that
legislation
in um March of
this year. We
need to hold polluters
economically responsible
for the toxic mess they've
spread across the planet
through E pr
legislation and we
need your help, a
statewide Plastic
Reduction Act similar
to the one passed in Santa
Fe County with an
incentivizing addition.
Promoting, bring your own
bags would be a good
first step forward for
our state. Thank
you.
>> Thank you very much. And
last on this panel,
we have Don Dewey
>> Mr, chair members of the committee.
Thank you for having me here
today. I'm honored
to have the opportunity to
speak in front of you as
a member of private
industry. I am
the president and owner of
soil Aleutians. We
are a company operating
here in Albuquerque and I'm
gonna shift us a little bit. There's
been so much talk about plastic,
which is so important, but
we are in the organic waste
business at Soil
Auss. And so uh next
slide, please.
So, Illusions is
a company that was founded here
in Albuquerque in 1996
and we divert organic
waste from the landfill
that organic waste being
defined as food waste or
yard, debris, yard trimmings.
Um Anything that basically was grown
by the earth is classified
as organic waste and
we transform that. We really
just use a a
method device by nature
herself over billions of
years. And we're just kind of putting
it into action instead of letting
this stuff rot in the
landfill to create
compost, soil and mulch to
replenish our state's depleted
soil. Um
I acquired the company in 2021
with some partners. Uh We're
young entrepreneurs. We've since
tripled the size of the business since
we acquired it. And we're expecting
to double again by
2026 which
we're quite excited about. Uh
We operate on 14
acres in Albuquerque, South
Valley. So you can see there a
couple of pictures of our
facility uh and
our screening plant. We
are at scale and we are well
positioned to partner with the
state public private
partnership to
launch some organic diversion
programs, which I'll talk a little bit more
about ideas there
as we go on next
slide, please. I
thought I would do a really quick
how compost is made
at soyu for anyone who's
not familiar, I think everyone knows
the term compost,
but the terms of how compost is made
might not be that familiar. So
how we make compost starts
by combining food
waste and yard debris
or yard waste. Uh
which food waste
is nitrogen, yard debris is the
carbon. We combine them at
specific ratios to
facilitate aerobic
decomposition. We
manage them in large
long piles which are kind
of hard to see on the screen but hopefully
easier in the printout uh
for a period of months
to facilitate that decomposition
until the compost is completed
and mature. And then
we sell that compost to our
community to residential
gardeners, to farmers,
landscapers
municipalities.
Um And I think it's so
important to talk
about II
I came early because
it's my first time doing something like this
to observe and get an idea of what I
had gotten myself into
and heard a lot of
talk about, you
know, dust and heat islands
and, and a lot of things that can
be solved by
healing our state soil.
So not only
does creating compost, get
waste out of the landfill,
but applying said compost
or state depleted soil
is almost a
cure all for many of the
climate issues that have been discussed
on different panels today.
Next slide, please.
Uh And so I talked about
our growth and how much we've been able to
grow soils
um since we acquired
it in 2021 a
lot of exciting stuff has
happened for us at Soil Solutions this
year in partnering with corporations
to get more food waste out of our
landfills. And so
the EPA estimates that
food waste is responsible for
58% of the
fugitive methane emissions coming
from municipal solid waste
landfills. And so we
decided to go big at soil
solutions. And in 2024
we sought out and have secured
partnership to divert food
waste from statewide
locations of whole
Foods, Walmart Groceries,
Costco's and Sam's clubs.
And we're also going to be bringing in
waste from eastern Texas
locations as well.
Um Through these partnerships,
we are in the process of
getting dep equipment
put on our site to be
able to bring
in even packaged foods to keep
those out of the landfill.
And so with all of these
exciting developments, you can
see a picture there of some
Walmart food waste being
received at our our manufacturing
facility there in the valley.
In 2025 we
expect to divert 25,000
tons or 50 million
pounds of food waste from the
landfills and turn it into
compost. Next
slide please. And
so now our next challenge which
as entrepreneurs were excited about
and already tackling
is we need to increase
our yard waste receipts
to balance that
nitrogen input. Like I talked about we have
to have those ideal ratios to make
compost. We need more
yard waste. We need to bring
in about 13,000
tons of yard waste.
And that's interesting. I'll talk about that
for a second because
we actually need volumetrically.
If you think of it, we measure things in,
we're in the bulk business. We measure
things in a cubic yard 3 ft
by 3 ft. We need much
more volumetric volume
of the yard waste, but it's much
lighter in weight than
food waste. So we need fewer
tons, but we need much more volume
of the yard waste to come
in to be
able to balance and continue
growing that food waste that we're
bringing in from the corporations
because we have more corporations on the
hook that we're growing after.
And so we've got many
initiatives in the works toward
this goal. Uh We're
developing right now a partnership
with the village of Los Ranchos here
to divert all of their green waste and bring
it to soil a solutions. We're
working closely with the US forest
service and hoping to apply
for their wood product innovation
grants to get some funding to
be able to source wood
from the people that are doing
that sustainable forestry management.
There's so much wood
and yard waste available in New
Mexico. It's just about
getting it to us and private industry
who are here ready to drive this.
We're also working to develop a
partnership with the Middle Rio
Grande Conservancy district
administrators
and through our
preparation for this dep
equipment, which is going to
seismically change our operation.
We've been talking to composers
around the country and
learned pretty quickly. Something
that was
I thought very relevant
today. Next slide, please.
Um I didn't mean to make
the top thing quite so directive.
It's more of a implore or
suggestion what
we learned in
many states where composting
industry, private composting
industry is really thriving
is that there are bans on
organic yard debris going
into the landfill. And
so I would implore new
Mexico lawmakers to
consider researching
such a ban that already exists
in 21 states in one
form or another
that would help drive
private industry to help us
recycle more of that organic
waste and
doing so will also
facilitate private industry to
be able to divert more food waste
out of the landfill and make more
compost. So that
would be our humble
suggestion as you're
considering things to help
with organic diversion from the landfill.
Thank you so
much.
>> OK. Thank you all for your
presentations. Going to the
committee. Um
We have 15 minutes
Representative Armstrong.
>> Thank you Mr Chairman and thank you
all for your presentation. I
have one quick question
and it's for
Sarah.
Um When you talk about
producer in
the, in the
uh
beverage
industry, are
we talking about
the manufacturer
or the distributor
>> manufacturer
in most in most? So,
so do you mean like it's
a well, so
like swire Coca Cola
bottling is in New Mexico
is handled by Southwest
beverages and
Swire
bottling as well in different parts
of our state. They are considered
the bottlers
and they are definitely still part of the
Pr O and I'm not exactly
sure where
that line is drawn, but
it is, it is part
of the overall system.
So it's a little bit
of mainly the
manufacturers but also the
producers.
>> So thank you Mr
Chairman. So it's,
it's I I
would highly recommend you
make sure who you're
going to find or
charge this fee
to because
it does make a
difference. And so I want to make
sure
how far down does it go? So
then does it hit
supermarkets?
You know, I just,
we need definition to
that so that we know
specifically
what we're dealing with when this
comes to
face. So
also thank you for that
very much.
And then on
your,
for dawn,
this is interesting and
fun and I really
like it. It's
sad that we have that much
waste of
food.
So in rural
New Mexico, we do this
ourselves
in our backyards and
in our
cattle pins and everywhere
else. But can you tell me
what this piece of equipment is
called? >> That's a
screening plant. It's a triple
deck screening plant. So when the compost
is finished, we run it through that and
it separates it into different
size of material.
And so when we call,
what comes out of the first
screen overs, there's large
overs and small overs which are
basically wood pieces
that weren't broken down completely
and we turn those into mulch
and sell them as mulch. And then
the finest material coming out of the
center is the fine compost
that's used as planting amendment or
to create a topsoil. >> Thank
you for that. And what does it
run on
>> uh that runs on
diesel? >> Thank you.
Thank you
all,
>> Senator
>> Felix.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
Mine are just a few
comments.
First about
the tires
many years ago, I was still
on the county commission.
So that would have been in
the, I don't know,
nineties. There
was,
there was a permit to
NMED for a
tire
recycling
plant
right down at the intersection
of I
40
cedar crust
and the purpose at
that time,
roads were being
repaved
with recycled
tires
and I would look
to see if that
endeavor. That
person is still in our
state because
it is being used
in other states. We just
are not doing it.
Secondly, I would
encourage all of you to
think about
what could be done with
rules versus
statutes.
Are there some things? And I'm
thinking about specifically
what could go into landfills
and not go into landfills.
Could that be a rule
from a department versus
needing a statute?
And then, and then
last
tomorrow, Kendall Chaves is
speaking and she
is with the Governor's food
program, food to farm and
farm to food and
whatever. But anyway,
she has an eye
on a composting program
for the state. So I would
encourage you
to
touch base with her if you
haven't. Thank you very
much.
Thank you, >> Representative
Lujan.
>> Thank you Mr Chair. Thank you. Thank
you presenters.
>> So I just kind of you
want to turn off your mics when
they're not in the news
>> might get a feedback.
Yeah. Thank
you and good to
see you, Mr Chair as you
know, we had some assembly
members from California
um come to
Santa Fe, come
last week, we got
to engage with them. But before that, some of
us here, Senator
Stefanik myself and, and
Representative Romero
and, and Senator
um Stuart, all were
in Portland for
this uh CS
G West conference
and we got to hear about
the of
the um the
policies that have some of the
policies you mentioned today as far
as you know, the, the
economic builder for
the circular
economies, which is
pretty fascinating to me, something
I've been looking at something I really want
to work with. You continue to work
and see that's what we need to be doing in our
state. Like Senator
Stefanik said that she,
she brings the wisdom
um to us and,
and know and like doing
more, a little bit more research of what's
going on in New Mexico.
And um I would even echo
some of the things we're doing at re unity.
Um farm
uh which is in my
district with
our compost and,
and their conservation
issues and they have a little
circular economy going
on for themselves
there. But this needs to be
brought in. There's room
for, I would say there's room
for the, the, the growth
of all this is, it's, it's,
it's a wonderful idea,
but everything is interconnected
and this is all interconnected with
under climate change, under our
energy goals, under, you
know, our carbon goals, everything is, is
really interconnected.
So I would,
I'm looking forward to working
more with you. One of and um
assembly members in, in California
who moved this, this policy
forward there, but really
gear it toward much
to what Senator
Stefanik is saying, gear it towards
New Mexico, what we've
already been able to accomplish how we
can get back to some of these
ideas and programs you've
already had
and, but this
grows into scale, right? I don't
think you've really touched too much about
that. What is the
for you, the vision or
the the bigger
scale of
that circular economy?
And in New
Mexico, Mr
chair,
>> thank you, Mr Chair,
Representative Lujan. Thank you
for the question. I think
you, you put a lot of,
of uh of the things I
would have said out there.
Um Looking at
uh local
entrepreneurs who
have built a business
um utilizing these
circular economy,
uh types of programs,
um unity, resources in
Santa Fe um
doing food, uh food waste
composting from, from
collection to drop off
and to having their farm
and, and then, um,
selling the produce, um,
soil lotions,
broken arrow recycling.
Um, who, who we got to
visit together
artists. Um,
again, looking for the
feedstock and seeing
a need. Um,
and, um, being able
to establish a
small collection
of glass and then
utilize that
as their feedstock for their
creative outlets.
So those are,
and they're, they're, they're small.
But um this country
was built on small businesses
and all of those ideas
are usually where those ideas
happen where they can scale
up. And I think
so like soil illusions is probably
a lot bigger than re unity.
Um But those
ideas are all out there
and they're scalable. And
so those are the kinds of things we'd like
to see and if we, if we
can bring forward a circular
economy type bill,
um I, I've taken a
very, very small bite of
that apple in my time
here, but I would envision
that to, to help.
Um So some kind of
program to help promote
those kinds of businesses
and
um
help, help
identify and make sure
that that feedstock flows
because recycling
is manufacturing. And
if you, if your feed, if you can't
rely on your feedstock,
then you can't manufacture goods
and you can't make that investment.
I hope that answered your question. Thank you,
>> Mr Chair. Yeah, I did. Yeah, I think we
need to look towards building
or looking at what that policy
looks like. I will look forward to
working during the interim to
see what that looks like
to fit New Mexico because
we are innovative here already
with, with the, with a
lot of our type
of innovative economies that
we have in place with. But
this is
um
how do I say Mr Chair?
I, when I think
of circular economy, when I first
thought about it, I thought about
our small rural
communities and
those especially that were affected
by the fires in Mora
and San Miguel and
how they already live off of the
land,
right? And they, their economies
and their, the way that they, their
income is based on
how they um,
how they do that
and, you know, that's, that's an
economy, that's, that's a
workforce, a type
of workforce. I don't think we really even really
tapped into and how we
develop that, that
workforce in that economy.
Um, there's so many pieces
to it but, um, to
me it's very exciting. I think it's the
next step in really innovation and
workforce also and
it's something that we haven't really touched
and what we see other
economies being built
out around
climate change.
That's what we're doing
um as an innovative
uh function
to a means to
an end if you will. So
there's a lot of work to be done and I look
forward to that. Thank
you.
>> Thank you uh >> verse
Kate.
Thank you, Chairman and thank you very
much for the presentation. I'm
just going to add on to
Representative Lujan. I,
I too
like, I love
this soils and
I like the circular economy,
especially when you're trying to
repurpose, reuse,
recycle. Um
Just other
small innovative
new Mexico's galloping
goat ranch.
They take in
food waste as well and
feed livestock with it
and then eventually we'll butcher
it and give it back to
food banks as
well. And so that's
been,
that's in Sandoval
County.
And Senator
Stefanik talked about
the company to create
roads from
plastic. I know
that we had them, they were
also uh
creating
the same materials
for playground
use. And I
know I did a huge research
15 years ago, on
investments, there's
machines that take the steel
belts out of tires
and then others that will
shred the tires.
You can use them for
non
biodegradable
mulch, which
sometimes that's appropriate
in certain places.
And, and,
and I would just ask
for those innovative
understanding, investments
in the small companies
if they need
investments in
equipment,
investments in
land
investments in
contracts with
resources that were going
to be a part
of our dump. Anyways,
those are
innovative economic
drivers
that
I think that you
would definitely have
um support,
not just with this committee
but with, with
the legislature itself.
And so thank you. I just wanted
to make sure that we,
we were thinking that way.
Thanks.
>> Thank you, Representative
Scott.
>> Thank you,
Mr Chairman.
Ladies. I find it
not at all
curious
that none of you
have
a plastic water
bottle at your
station.
So given the
fact that the United States
has probably spent
10 bazillion
dollars
ensuring
the drinking water
supply of every
municipality
in this country
is safe to
drink.
Should we
start
with the 29
billion
bottles of water that
are sold in this country
every
year?
>> Sure.
I mean, there are obviously
Mr chair members of the
committee, there are time and
space when that's really important. I know
like the water issue
in Las Vegas, New Mexico, they're
having to have safe bottled water brought
in. Um
But yes, the single
use plastic items
such as your water bottles,
such as your
plastic fork. They're
usually used about for
about 12 minutes
and it makes up about 40%
of the discarded plastics that
go into our landfills every,
every year. So,
um one
simple thing, I, I had my water, I
drove from Santa Fe. It's kind of
empty. I went to go refill
it here and it didn't have a bottle
refill. It had a, you
know, got to tip it and try
and do that with the drinking fountains.
Simple things like refill
stations in local in community
areas. Make a really
big difference. Have you seen at the airport
where it says you fill your bottle? Like you've
saved this many
plastic bottles, things like
that do really
help.
>> OK, I
will, I
will amend that to any
effort to ban plastic
bags in the state.
I think that would be >> the
New Mexico Recycling Coalition
supports a single use
plastic bag ban.
We worked with Senator Steinborn
last year to bring AAA
statewide bill um
to the session and it didn't
end up
passing. But you know, I,
I believe Senator Steinborn would be willing to
do that again with us.
I I
the model bill that the recycling
coalition works with
um reduces single use
plastic bag
with a
fee. I know people don't like
that word but it's not a tax,
it's a fee. It basically means like city
of Santa Fe has done and City of Las
Cruces has done. It
means at the point of sale,
if you bring your own bag,
great. Don't pay a fee
if you're on, if you're on food stamps
or wic or any sort of benefits,
don't pay the fee. But
if you need to buy
a bag, you pay 10
cents to buy
a paper bag and that
money can either stay with the
store to kind of help
them offset any admin
cost in Santa Fe.
Nine cents of it goes
to the city
and it raises about $100,000
a year that they can then use for education
and outreach to and
sustainability issues.
And one cent stays with
the um with this grocery
store in Las Cruces,
they have 5050
this was the first year they just implemented
their ban and they just got about
um $250,000
to work on their sustainability
budget. And the woman who's in charge
of that was like, this is so good.
I have money to fund my outreach
and education. I have money to do
these programs. I've been wanting to
do so. Charlene
was the head of the city of Santa Fe.
So the environmental services
division. So she knows about
that, how well that
10 cent fee can do. And
then of course, Styrofoam styrofoam
as Stephanie
mentioned, Styrofoam is
really toxic. None of us should be
eating off a styrofoam. Um
So there's health impacts
obviously as the recycling coalition.
I don't know about those as much as a
doctor or AAA
professor.
I do know that it's a top
contaminant in our recycling
programs. So the recycling
coalition would like to see
efforts to
reduce the amount of styrofoam
take out and food containers
that we have in our
state.
>> So we're a little bit over.
We're gonna try to wrap up, we
have two more people on the list,
Mr >> Chairman. That was my
last comments,
>> Scott. Thank you,
Rosen Romero.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Two quick
questions, one
to the point of
prioritizing
um policy
and thank you to everyone
in the panel um for speaking
today. Um I'm
really interested in the
uh you know, having the polluters
pay type question
um as a more system
of things as to, you know,
these externalities that we're
paying for.
Um
When was, how
long has this been in
practice with,
with Colorado and perhaps
other actors and in setting
up these programs? And,
you know, is it something that is
a neighbor to Colorado or
something like that that we could
easily sort of implement?
And what, what does that look
like,
>> Mr Chair members of the committee?
Thank you, Representative
Romero. Um
so extended producer
responsibility and producers responsibility
started with really toxic things
like um pharmaceuticals
or mercury containing auto
switches, things like that.
And those, you know, and even
you can consider some of the
um the bottle bills,
you know, where you pay a fee like
in Maine and Oregon, like that
is sort of a type of in some
ways in some systems. And
that's been around for 10 or 15
years. Um The
five states that have
passed a packaging E
Pr bill have done
so since 2021
it's Maine Oregon,
Colorado,
California and Minnesota passed
theirs a few months ago.
And um
Colorado wants to partner
with us. They,
they want to create a regional
product stewardship program.
And one thing a lot of you have mentioned
was talking about the circular
economy and economic
development. And
the reason that's working in, in
Colorado so well is they
tax their trash,
every ton of trash that goes
across their lands, their land
into their scale into the landfill
pays like maybe I forget
like 50 cents a ton
that money is then goes to the
state of Colorado. I think it's
their health department and they
can give that money to
private business, to
bring that business to the
state, to take the discarded
materials and make something out of
it. So I know New
Mexico has a uh some
differences with um
anti donation clauses
but, but it's, but
if you want to create markets
for recyclable material, you have to
create markets and you have
to have some sort of Circular
Economy Development Center.
They want to work with us, the Colorado
Circular Economy Development
Center. Their um
executive director came and
spoke at our training on June
6 and she's like, how can we partner
with New Mexico? We how can we
partner with New Mexico? So
they're building that um
circular economy just a couple
of hours north of us.
Um And you know, in
New Mexico, we do have one
mill. It's a cardboard mill,
it's in Pruitt, New Mexico, right? By
grants and the
cardboard that we recycle in New
Mexico, it's taken
to, to grants and turn into new
cardboard in 60 days. It's a beautiful
circular Colo's loop system.
We can do that for other things.
Organics. I love
organics because it's
such a you can see it so
clearly, food
waste, organics,
new food
again.
Thank you, >> Mr Chair,
Representative Romero.
Yeah, these kinds of laws have
been around for a long time. So
many of them are tried and true. They don't
all look the same, there isn't a
one size fits all.
Um And so different states
can approach them
differently. Um I was part
of getting a couple of
electronics. E pr laws
passed in Texas
um way back
during the time where
L monitors were,
were still around
and the analog to
digital switch for TV S was
happening. And so
two laws got passed for
um electronics and
for, for monitors and
screens. And one of the
reasons that Dell
will take back your computer for
recycling today is because
of that law.
So it, it,
it works locally and then
it, it works more
regionally or
nationally. Um And
those laws exist in Europe,
pretty much all of the
companies that do business in
America are under those,
those laws and have been for a very
long time in Europe. So they
can do the same thing here that they do
there.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. I would love
to pursue
further this
legislation, what it would look like for New
Mexico. And again, that regional
idea with Colorado sounds
amazing, would love to hear
more about who has done
that and who's still
interested. And then the final question
is just about the
um the organic
material. I know there are
programs around the state, including
one in our local community
that um is looking
at sort of taking
food out of landfill, but also
first line of,
of, I guess, first right,
of reviews are all of those
that are going to Food
Bank and that are given
to those in need. And I'm just
curious how that relationship
works with the list of folks that
you work with and
just making sure that food that
can be consumed first before
going into landfill or to
organics. Like if the, how
that chain of command
works. >> Yeah, Mr Chair
representative, I
actually don't know what
Walmart's chain is.
I believe that they follow the
recommended chain which is, you know,
feed needy people first,
etcetera and compos is
somewhere down that line.
Um I'm not privy to their
actual policies around that. I just
know how much food waste we receive
from them and it is a lot
and it, it's unfortunate how much
food is wasted.
Uh for
sure.
>> Yeah. Thank you Mr Chair. I just
goes back to the need for data
to just make sure that we're
the highest and best use type of
thing. So I appreciate that. Thank you Mr
Chair. >> Thank
you representative.
Um I had one just
quick question
um for Miss Dewey based
on personal experience.
Uh my family does not
have a
an organized uh
composting
habit. Um
We have a, I would
call an informal composting
habit meaning we
take uh banana
peels and orange peels and
chuck them in the yard.
Um and it's a big
rural area. So I, you know,
it's like, you know,
it, you know, trying
to add to the uh the
biomass. Um
but the constant struggle I
have uh with my wife
is uh honey,
you gotta take the
banana sticker
off the peel
before you check in the yard.
And I wonder just like,
how do you deal with like
contaminants
when you're doing the composting?
Because, you know, if you
get, you know, one
plastic bag in there
and it gets all chopped up,
you've got little bits of plastic
everywhere.
>> Mr Chair. Thank you for that question.
And it's definitely one of
our biggest challenges that
we're dealing with on a daily basis. And
so we take a multi proned
approach from
training the employees
in these stores that are sending
us the food waste on the front end
to try to help them understand
what our process is. I've got a
training at Whole Foods on Wednesday.
Um And then our, our
team goes through
and hand picks out any
trash they find in our input
streams, which is
not the funnest job, which is why
we do the best we can
to make sure that the inputs coming
in from our suppliers are clean
as they can be from the food producers.
And actually, uh they're
doing a fantastic job the, the
food waste we're getting from Walmart
and Whole Foods. Uh They,
they've worked really hard, they're really
training their staff and we've
been blown away
just having started working with
Walmart a few months
ago. I was actually really nervous
about it. It's, it's
impeccably clean. They're doing a
fantastic job and
of course, we definitely have produce
stickers and those,
you know, it's not feasible for
our team to go through and hand pick
those out. But
we find that most,
most of those stickers get screened
out and during our screening process
through that screening plant and
then we message to customers,
you know, if you, if you
find a, a banana
sticker, uh bring it back and we'll
give you a quarter because you know,
we're doing our very best, but we
are an organics diversion
company that is getting food waste out of
the landfill. So some getting in there
is inevitable, but it's
really just about having a
multifaceted management
approach because it is
part of the reality
of receiving food waste
organics.
>> And thank you
for that. And I think, you know, a
lot of
improving the waste stream
is, is
addressing what goes into the
waste stream. And I have, I
took this picture
because it amazed me. It was
from um
sprouts, um
their plums, I think not only
are there stickers for the
plums, but every
single plum has a sticker that
says
organic
and like you don't need
that.
Um So, I mean,
that's something that I think the stores
could be educated about
>> Mr Chair. Absolutely.
And I
would love to see
and I think there's some technology, I don't
know how close it is and I need to look into it
further, you know,
the, the end
to produce stickers in
general can they stamp
the produce, you know, do
something that does not
have to be a piece of plastic on the
fruit or vegetable that has to be peeled
off and dealt with in facilities like
ours that are processing and reusing
those organics. You know, I'll
buy bananas at the store and every
banana has a sticker on the front
and on the back and it's like,
what are we doing? I totally
agree. And
you have no idea how much I
empathize with your frustration
on the frodo stickers that
are just
crazy.
>> Thank you very much to the panel
before everyone gets up.
Uh I just want to announce, we do
have a, a dinner for the
committee at Ex
Novo Brewing Company
4895
Corrales Road. So it
actually is in Corrales.
Um And that starts
uh momentarily if
anyone needs directions or the
address. Uh Just let
us know. Thank you all
very much. Uh We are in
recess. We will start
again tomorrow at nine o'clock
moment
and the
