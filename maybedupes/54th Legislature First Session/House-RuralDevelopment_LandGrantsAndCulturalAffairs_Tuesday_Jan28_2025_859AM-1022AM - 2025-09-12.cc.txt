Yeah
looks like we have this morning
thank you for showing us really
excited
just toss Mason, thank you all
for joining. So we have we have
3 girls are with 2021 fund
changes.
Chairman Chairman McQueen hand
it over to you.
everyone,
thank you for having us.
Good morning, McQueen,
um, so what we have today are
changing to the assistance.
A couple, couple of years ago in
order to pass legislation.
So, you know, but they don't
receive any tax receipts.
So even within boundaries.
So we have the government entity
and they were funded.
for grants
to about $500,000 a year
roughly,
and that allows to hire
attorneys,
accountants services for
people in their community and to
the language
today anyway, you know we
we my grandparents who were
having sales and yard sales in
order to
pay for the.
The fact that they're
subdivisions.
So we
we pass the I think it's been a
great, great, um, and then we're
coming back to Mars Mars small,
small tweaks to make it make it
better.
And
the title, the Council, which is
stands in for me.
Good morning,
mornings is director of the
Council, um, um, we only have a
few small changes that were
requested this sort of sort of
help um make the
1st, 1st is to increase the
minimum
on the er the to the
revenue from the previous year,
currently right now there's
there's 50 $50,000 50,000 then
they're in their title fund.
So the distributed as that is
divided by the number of land
grants
and that becomes a 100%
distribution that
in this instance, um if you
50,000,000 right now, you then
get a tribution and what we're
asking is that to 10,000
actually.
out and recovering programs. So
for example we had one that had
a
a revenue of 50 $51,000 that's
$000 20,000 dollars in revenue
that they have distribution, um,
um,
so that's that's you
you don't mind, OK.
No,
I give it a moment.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
Not
Alright, everybody, we're back.
I just want to make sure that
anyone who is able to watch.
So, so sorry to you.
Uh, uh,
Thank you members of the
committee, uh, the other, other
change that we're requesting the
reversion
at the end of the end of schools
that's actually not a large
amount, um,
usually we have left on this is
just um um
for example, in this
distribution
up to $600,000.
So it's a small amount that
actually what this is it and
then it would get distributed
eligible.
Ma'am, um,
the, the different things,
right? There's there's, you
know, some, some, you know,
maybe
they do,
one property, uh, you have to
have a campsite site,
um, so, so they're they're um
they've always been with, with
land grants that they do so much
with so little.
So this is money well spent.
Are you ready for questions
Thank you, thank you
can you?
And can you can you raise your
hand if her post.

Uh, uh,
my name is my name is
Mexico
Uh, uh, my name is my name is
Ios on different projects they

This is will be very
very important
the ability of the land

uh
uh tremendous possibil.
more,
more than that
more
more than
um um
in all of the lands wires to be

the project they have in
in our
in the future.
Good morning.
I'm Grant
and we sta. Thank you.
Good morning members of the
committee.
Association for the
committee. Association for all
the reasons
legislation. Thank you, thank
you.
Uh, one of, uh, madam chair,
chair, uh, chair members and
everybody else, my number is
Joaquinto Villavea Jesus, um,
I'm here representing, uh.
The Merce community land grant
we were honored to be one of the
lead uh land grants on HB 268
back in 2023, no, so I thank you
all for that support.
And as it relates to this, um,
You know, I want to be honest
that that legislation and
For those of us that are just
now qualifying to receive any
formal recognition, any formal
support.
It's really key
You know, it's been 200 years
that we've had to sell land.
Just to hire a lawyer to not
lose land, no, Mayawelo was the
last one to hire a lawyer in the
70s, and we still lost all that
land, right? And, and so now an
example I can give you is uh
A lot of that land is coming on
the market, um, because of
Luxury tourism investments and
uh
Although the the law and these
type of um issues help us. I, I
want you to really put it into
perspective.
You know, when we try to apply
for a loan, we're only getting
30% of what the land is worth on
the market and we got to compete
with developers.
So it's like
Somebody takes your house, and
takes your land.
And then they tell you live in
your garage, so you fix up your
garage, and then the government
says we're gonna give you a loan
so you can buy back your
driveway.
But you don't even have a car.
So it's like, you know, we
appreciate all the support, but
I just put it in perspective,
you know, the loans, the legal
services, everything we're
getting, the first time in 200
years we're getting any little
bit of support, but we need
more.
And of course, we get some ICIP
but if they give us 200,000 and
we need 1.5, we have to sit in a
few years and go around begging
in the rotunda Dado Vuelta
asking for somebody to give us
kina.
And then they don't think we
qualify or we have the ability
to manage it or run it because
we've never done it before.
But thank goodness to the land
grant council and all these
other expertise and the other
land grants before us that have
done it. They're mentoring us,
they're teaching us, they're
showing us this is the right way
to do it. We have a, you know,
accountants, we have audiences,
we have all these things, our
newer generation are being
overwhelmed with our volunteer
time, trying to learn at the
same time honoring our elders
who did their best not to lose
everything. So, I just wanted to
tell you all.
Thank you for what you're doing.
As other politics and people
kind of try to pick us apart
just Corazon, just tell him,
hey, they're trying to figure it
out.
But it takes a little while to
undo 200 years of abuse.
By real estate, by politicals,
by developers, by our own
familia, they're stealing our
lands.
And the little bit of help we
get from the land grant council
and other people, just give them
skina. Don't put them on the hot
seat here. Don't make them
question a million things that I
can't even tell them that we're
fighting back home because we
just want them to feel inspired,
you know, and we want you to
feel inspired. So with that, I
want to say I'm in support of
the bill and any other anecdotes
or history or
Things with no names cause we
don't want Peleaass back home.
We'll share with you, but as to
be confidential because we're
all still family and we all
still want to get along, you
know. So with that, I'll I'll
turn over the mic.
Hi, I'm Andrea LaCros Crawford,
and I'm an attorney in Santa Fe.
I've worked with land grants and
kis since I got licensed back in
2011. And I just wanted to speak
in support of the bill. I think
that anything we can do to
support the land grants, um,
especially here where it's
really a drop in the bucket and
a lot of bang for the buck is
something that we should do. So,
that's all I have to say.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Brian Martinez. I'm from
Chimayo. I'm the uh secretary of
the Santa Cruz land grant that's
seeking political subdivision
status, this in this
legislature, and we're hoping
for your support. I'm also a
vice chair of the Rio Santa Cruz
uh sec uh
uh association that represents
66 sekis, so we have hundreds of
parentes and Langrantes, and as
you are all aware, I want to
echo.
What what's been said this
morning, um, but asekis and land
grants are grassroots
organizations led by volunteers,
and it's important that that we
all remember that these are
volunteer organizations and they
desperately need this funding
and so I want to support this
bill wholeheartedly, and I hope
that uh it it will go through,
um, and, and, uh, and, and help
our communities because uh at
the grassroots level, uh, that's
the, that's the uh epitome of
government
meant working for the people.
So thank you.
Whenno there, my name is Don
Bustos. Uh, I'm a small, uh,
farmer up in the village of
Santa Cruz, member of the Ase
Association and a member of the
Santa Cruz land grant and uh we
stand in full support of this.
Thank you.
Looks like that's it we have for
public comment. We're gonna come
over to the committee, uh, first
up, we have, uh, Representative
Lord.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Uh, it's
good to see everybody. I spent
the summer with a lot of you. I
was in the land grant committee
over the summer until the end
had to run for office. So sorry
about that if I missed meetings.
Archo, good to see you again.
Thank you, Representative, for
bringing this bill forward. And
I just want to recognize um the
president of Chile Lee who's in
my district, Juan Sanchez, thank
you for being here. You get some
recognition today.
Anyway, so thank you, um, I do
have some questions on this
cause I know there's been issues
with making sure that people are
compliant in the financial
compliance requirements. So is,
has anything been done to make
sure that everybody gets the
proper training cause I know
some people had problems with
auditing and stuff. Is that been
cleaned up or do people have the
ability, availability to get the
training so that they are
eligible for the funding.
Madam Chair, uh,
Representative Lord, uh, great
question. Uh, yeah, we, uh, at
the council do provide uh
technical assistance and support
to land grants. Um, we actually
have two staff members, um, that
work with land grants on
financial compliance issues. Uh,
we have one staff member that
works with them um on the
budgetary side and make sure
that they get all of their
budgetary reporting in, um, that
they're able to sort of track
and maintain their finances
correctly, and then we have uh
another individual who works um
on making sure that they sort of
have all their audit
requirements.
that they're doing their
applications, um, for, uh, you
know, uh getting there, um,
agreed upon procedures because
those that received
distributions have to do in
agreed upon procedures report
with the state A's office so
helping them get those contracts
in place. Um, the challenge, uh,
we do have land grants, um, that
sometimes aren't able to get
across the line before the
deadline. And so, although they
may be working on their audits,
for example, um, because there's
a backlog for a lot of these
smaller communities, they're not
um typical entities and so
There's not a lot of uh CPAs
that will actually do these type
of um engagements, and so, um,
sometimes some of the land
grants miss out because they
don't get within the deadline,
the first cutoff for eligibility
for the, the fund is you have to
be um deemed compliant by the
auditor's office. And so that
happens on September 1st, and so
we do our best to try to get
every language gun across the
finish line there, um, to get to
the next uh level of review, um,
but on, you know, not every
every single language that makes
it, um, but we do our best.
to try to help those um land
grants that need it, get across
the line.
Thank you for.
Oh
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you for answering that
question. So my question, my
second question is, uh, when it
comes to the CPAs, cause I know
that's also been an issue. Are
the land grants were responsible
for hiring their own
accountants, or is there one
accountant that everybody could
use with a non-disclosure that
they wouldn't tell other land
grants what's going on there
land grant for, I'm sorry, I'm
just pretty honest about this
stuff. So how does that part
work out?
Uh, Madam Chair, Representative
Lord, so, uh, in order to comply
with the audit act, um, land
grants have to go out and
procure a, it's called the IPA
and independent public
accountant, um that is on an
approved list of the auditor's
office. So that is something
that they have to go out and
procure, um, and as I mentioned,
there's not a lot of IPAs who
are certified public
accountants, um, that do this
work, and that's been one
challenge that we've had is
finding. So when we do find uh
individuals who are willing to
take this.
On um we do provide that
information to other land grants
so they can also reach out and
potentially engage with that um
IPA, a couple of, uh, we had uh
one individual, actually about 2
individuals who were doing the
majority of these, um, and last
year one of the individuals got
out of, of doing of those
anymore and so that sort of
created a big um gap for us and,
and it sort of put us behind and
we'd be able to been able to
help Langrens locate um some
additional IPAs who are willing
to take these on. And so our
hope is that as as this become
was more of a regular thing.
There'll be more IPs out there
willing to take on these uh type
of engagements.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and, uh,
yeah, because it has always been
kind of the gap there, you know,
that's always the problem, and I
wonder if there's something we
can do in New Mexico in any of
our schools for training for
that. I'm just, I'm just
spitballing some stuff so we can
get more people involved in
that.
Uh, Madam Chair and represent
the, the only other question I
really had was, I'd noticed and
maybe this got cleared up, uh,
because I want this bill to move
forward, uh, on the analysis on
the fis fiscal impact report. It
said there was some technical
issues. Uh, it says that, uh,
perhaps we'll uh 16 at making an
appropriation is not in the
title. Is that something that
you need to address to make sure
we don't get logged up as that
moves forward, I'm sure.
You know where you go next?
Madam Charon and represent him
and I try, I just don't want
this to get clogged up and I
just saw the one technical issue
and I wanted to make sure that
got
Fixed or or if it didn't
already, maybe it did and this
was old, but I just don't want
this to get tripped up as we
move forward.
Mante represent Lord, I note on
the technical issues, it says an
argument can be made including
making the land grant we said
assistance fund non-referring
does not require the phrase
making an appropriation. I'm
happy to check on that before it
goes next or before it's turning
in its next committee. OK, that
was my only question because I
support the bell and I support
the land grant, so I just didn't
want this to become an issue as
we move down the road. Um,
Oh, and I have to recognize one
more person Jason Katana from
Monzano and uh another person
from my land grant. So thank you
guys, all of you for showing up
and supporting the bill and
making commentary. Thank you.
Thank you, rep. Uh, next up on
our list we have Rep Mason.
I think I'm here.
Little room, I figured everybody
could hear me.
Sorry, Madam Chair.
Representative, uh
I've, I've
Notice there
In several bills there this
clause to
Remove the reversion of funds.
From these funds to the.
Dental fund
Uh, why?
What happens to the
Is there a capped amount of
money that y'all spend each year
for?
Appropriations
To the
Land grants
Or
This money goes back into the
fund, so then next year you
should needless appropriation or
How does that work?
Uh, ma'am Chair represent Mason,
the way the fund works is it's a
percentage of
Grocery seeds tax. So it's a
very small percentage. So that
amount of money goes into the
fund every year, then they go
through the, the qualification
and the math, math, and they
divide it out. And so what would
happen is,
Instead of like, you know,
60,000, 100,000, whatever it is,
going back to the general fund,
it would just stay there. Next
year, the same percentage or
would come in and be a slightly
different amount, but that
there'd already be that sort of
little bit of money in there.
They would add those together,
then again they would do the
math and they would just divide
it out. So it's not, it's first
of all, it's not a lot of money,
and secondly, it would get uh
distributed out the following
year.
And representative, thank you.
So actually it should increase
the amount of payout.
by the amount that is reverted
back. Um, yeah, and then,
you know, the appropriation.
It will not increase the
appropriation, that's correct.
Um, uh, it just, it by not
sending it back to the general
fund, it does the next year, you
know, they'll be divided by the
number of qualified land grants
so it won't be a lot of money
because you get divided by 16 or
20 or whatever, whoever
qualifies and paid out.
Like to represented.
Uh, next question, Madam Chair,
uh.
Definitely hit on this. I went,
there's a list in here of those
that are approved to get.
There's, but there's quite a few
that are not approved.
So, or we've
I kind of think she said are
we're working to try to get
All of them on board or do some
of them not want on board for
some reason or?
So the uh uh ma'am chair was a
Mason that the list in the uh
analysis are the list of
statutory land grants. They're
the land grants that are
explicitly recognized by statute
we passed a year or two ago,
naming them so it was clear who
was a political subdivision.
Um, not all the land grants have
been able to meet the the audit
qualifications and all the
things they need to do as a
political subdivision in order
to be eligible for the the
money. And so that's, you know,
one of the things that we
You know, as a, as a state
accomplished by through the land
grant uh assistance fund is the,
the land grants are working to
sort of professionalize, right?
They're, they're meeting the,
the audit act, they're hiring
CPAs, they're hiring attorneys,
and they're, they're running
their political subdivision as
we would expect other political
subdivisions to be run.
Thank you representative. Yes,
uh, that answered mine because
Adam chair, you know, our small
towns and other places that are.
subdivision run the same problem
that very little.
Grocery seats, income, they have
very little means to
create money for their.
Subdivisions or towns or
villages or whatever.
Terminology you'd like to, but
they all fight the same problem
and uh.
And uh, you know, I
It's, it is a problem all
through the state.
That's one question I have, and
I haven't seen it.
Is there anything that we as a
body can do.
To help all of these
subdivisions.
Increase the revenues and
decrease their dependence,
ma'am, uh, Mason, you know, at
some point, we might want to go
back and look at the percentage
that's going into the fund and
and bump that up a little.
That's, that'd be the easiest
way to increase the land grant
uh assistance fund.
Um, all the lan grants
themselves, uh, there's, um, a
remarkable spirit and philosophy
of uh being an entrepreneur and
like doing things that not only
that they can earn income from,
but that also help uh their
members. So like a, like a
cattle lease, for example, you
know, that earned some income
for the uh for the land grant,
and if you're leasing to a
member, um, you know, that
they're probably making a little
money there too.
Thank you, Representative and
Madam Chair,
I really like that, but is there
something as we as a body can.
You know,
I raised cattle too. There's
very little.
I mean, as far as
What about
Businesses that pay groceries
receive tax on these execus or.
Different businesses.
That
Provide
In instead of us giving them
more money some way for them to
make more money. I think, I
think, uh, that we should keep
the questioning directed at the
bill, but I, but I do think
that's a wonderful conversation
that we do need to engage in in
this committee, and afterwards,
rap, you know, you and I can
chat about putting that on the
calendar as well. I think that's
an important deep tie. I was
just thank you, Madam Chair,
sorry if I'm just about to, uh.
Definitely got most of my
questions, Madam Chair.
This uh is like I said, you
know, these are existing bills
and us.
I think I mean I stand in favor
of the bill.
I just
Always
is in
Business when I think of what
what can we do to make people.
More independent
Thank you, thank you, Madam
Chair. Thank you,
Representative.
Thank you, Mason, you always
always good uh, good, good food
for thought. uh Rep Gonzalez.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair. Um,
I just have some, some questions
is, um, first off, I want to
thank you for your efforts. Um,
I know it's not easy to take.
community members do this as a
task of the heart, so it's not
often in your skill set for
audits and financial paperwork
and so I do understand and
recognize the amount of work and
time that goes into this, um,
from the
Obviously, the goal is fiscal
compliance with, with these land
grants, um, from the start of
the bill, the conception in
2022, um, and the question is
twofold. One is, have you seen
uh an increase in fiscal
compliance with this assistance.
Right now, out of the, out of
the number of land grants
eligible for funds. Um, do you
have an estimate as to how, what
the percentages that are in
compliance right now to
Madam Chair, Representative
Gonzalez, um, thank you for that
question. Um, yeah, so.
In the past two years, so the,
the fund's fairly new, uh, it's
only this is the 3rd year of a
distribution, um, in both, uh,
last year and the previous year,
we had 17 land grants that were
eligible that received a
distribution, and those weren't
all the same 17, um, we did have
a couple of land grants who had
received distributions, but they
didn't, weren't able to get,
this is the first time they had
to do a full blown um
Agreed upon procedures and they
weren't able to get in the door
in time to get the next year's
distribution. Um, so we had a
couple that were previously not
in compliance that came in,
right? So there was a little bit
of a switch out and we're hoping
that, you know, next year
that'll sort of double up. We do
have some uh land grants that
are eligible as, as
Representative McQueen mentioned
that sort of is the total list
of potentially eligible land
grants, um, and we have some
land grants that are either in
different sort of um a couple of
land grants that are still
trying to get
In terms of their structure
correct, uh, make sure they have
all their people working and
we're working with them to sort
of do that. Um, and then we have
a couple of land grants that
don't necessarily need to rely
on the fund, and so they're sort
of fine as they are, um, if they
did get a distribution, it will
probably be like the lowest
level, like a 25%, um, and so
they just haven't made it a
priority to be like we need to
make sure we get everything in.
Um, they just sometimes they
just won't even turn in the
certification paperwork because
they're like, that's just not
something that we're we're we're
finding what we're doing and
we're comfortable with the other
land grants that need.
sort of taking advantage of the
fund. Um, so,
Um, I, I don't know if that
answers your question, but we do
have uh nearly 20 land grants
that are sort of ready um to to
continue to receive
distributions and we do work
with those that are not, and we,
we try to provide as much
support as as we can, um, but at
the end of the day it also comes
down to sort of their individual
capacity and their desire to
sort of get through those
hurdles, um, and sometimes
because a lot of they are
volunteers, um, elected
volunteers, um, and they have
full-time jobs. It just takes a
little bit longer um than if
they had full-time professional
staff.
And we have noticed that some
land grants that have been able
to uh get the funding they've
been able to actually hire, you
know, part-time staff, maybe a
bookkeeper, and it's and it's
helping them to sort of just get
that much more ready to be in
compliance and subsequent. Madam
Chair, thank you so much for
your response. I know it's,
it's, it's a work in progress. I
know it's a new fund. It does
take time to get these, but um
just like to see the onward
trends that these funds are
actually helping with that
fiscal compliance and I believe
that they are, but just, you
know, I was looking to make
everyone um
accountable
Vice Chair Sanchez.
Madam Chair, I move ad have a
motion for a due pass that's
been seconded. Can we take the
role?
Or, yeah, please call the.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Uh, we have uh by a vote of 6 to
0, you have a, a motion the
motion passes for House Bill 24.
You have a do pass. Thank you.
The committee.
Thank you very much, um,
Representative Lord, the bill
goes to HAFC next, so I'll check
with Chairman Small on that, on
that language.
Great, thank you. Next up we
have House Bill 24.
As representative.
Garcia here.
We'll give him a minute to to
come over.
I didn't see pop up.
Uh, we'll go and hand it over.
We're going to start hearing
House Bill 24.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Uh, members of the committee,
uh.
Uh, Madam Chair, we're working
off of the sub.
Um, so,
So if you could entertain
emotion.
To adopt a sob for discussion
purposes and will proceed to go
into this um.
Can we get the sub passed out? I
don't know if everyone already
has it already.
You should have the sub.
Can we, can we get a motion to
discuss uh the substitute.
Moved
Once we get it passed out, we'll
just confirm the 202 number on
it. OK.
So representatives
we've moved the uh sub for
discussion. What's the 202
number?
one is that? OK. Yeah, please,
thank you.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, um,
This is not a new program.
Uh, this has been in existence
since 2000 and
Um, 20.
Um
And I kind of want to go a
little bit into the background.
So what we're doing with the
substitute bill is just making
Some necessary changes.
To give the program of
A more integrity.
In terms of the role of the
department of higher ed and the
UNM School of Law.
And uh when we started the land
grant interim committee in 2003.
Uh, there was
A handful of priorities that the
land grants wanted to undertake.
Naturally, the primary uh
priority.
Of that first interim committee
was
The enhancement, empowerment of
land grants as a recognized unit
of government.
And that was important, Madam
Chair, because the land grant,
Spanish land grant communities
are the oldest form of local
government that we have in the
state.
The first land grant was granted
in 16.
Uh, 92, which is the land grant
that I live on the Atrisco La
Grant.
And
Uh, the land grant, so
One of the priorities, uh, that
the land grants brought forth,
Madam Chair.
In that 2003 interim committee.
Was the need.
To kind of create.
A a basis in which we can
Uh
Have attorneys.
Take up the needs and issues,
the legal needs and issues of
our land grants.
And thus
That led to what we have today.
In terms of the community.
Governance attorney act.
That provides
Attorneys through a process.
On the tuition waiver.
Um, and not only for land
grants, but also for a psychias
and colonias.
Uh, and these are needy kind of
uh local governments.
And projects, especially in the
colonnas is colonas for the most
part are not.
Units of government, they're
basically communities.
Uh, unincorporated.
And uh so, Madam Chair, um,
This program.
Uh
Was we tried for about 5 years
to kind of implement the
legislation.
And finally
In Governor Michel Luhans
Grisham, first year in 2019.
We got it passed unanimously in
both chambers. Unfortunately.
Counter to Hana Grisham, pocket
veto the legislation. So then
what happened, Madam chair, and
that she did pocket vetoes on
the on the on about 15 projects,
15 initiatives that passed both
house and chamber both House and
Senate without
Oppositional votes.
So what the legislature did in
2020.
Is that we put together a rocket
docket.
These were 15 pieces of
legislation that Governor
Michelle Loha Grisham, pocket
vetoed with no oppositional
votes.
And this time,
Uh, so we, we, we fast tracked
these 15 pieces of legislation,
naturally, with the cooperation,
coordination of the governor's
office.
And uh a lot of times some of
these initiatives only had one
committee hearing.
But
Uh, that's how this program got
implemented in 2019. Now I'd
like to turn it over to uh my
expert Adrian Ogilvy.
And of a renowned um.
Um
Uh, professor there at the UNAM
School of Law.
And also he is the chairman.
Of
The commission for the community
governance, um, attorney
program.
So,
Adrian, if you could kind of go
into uh what you have to present
and then we'll get into those.
Uh, the amendment tweak.
Right, thank you, Representative
Garcia. Madam Chair, members of
the committee, uh, it's a
pleasure to be here with you
today. Um, thank you for that
kind introduction. Um, did, uh,
provide a little handout. Um,
I'll just walk you through
quickly. Um, uh, just to give
you the groundwork for the, the
little bit of sausage making we
need to do this morning
together. So as, as um
Representative Garcia has
mentioned, um, uh, this is a
program that is intended to get
more lawyers educated about
colonious land grants and asseas
out there practicing.
Um, one thing that we recognized
early in our um interactions
with the new land grant
committee was that, you know, we
have, we have judges in New
Mexico who don't know what land
grants are. Um, you don't
understand the status of
colonius, um, who don't
understand the history and
nuances of aces and so, um, the
way this program works is it's,
it's actually what we call a
loan for service program, the
legislature provides money. We,
um, there's a commission uh
choose a 3rd year law student
and
Um, we provide them with their
tuition, their costs, and a
living stipend. It's a package
worth about $45,000. And then um
the legislature also provides
funding um to pay half of their
salary for the 1st 2 years out
of law school.
Um, they need to be placed at
what we call a legal service
provider who provides services
to Asia's land grants and
colonia, and we'll get into some
of those details uh here in a
moment.
Um, uh, we at the law school,
my, my center, the U and
Transboundary Resource Center
is, is charged with um
administering this program. And
so I sit on the commission as
the dean's designee, and I
wanted to recognize Andrea La
Cruz Crawford behind me who's
our newest commissioner. We're
really thrilled to have her on
board. She's brought some new
energy and some great new ideas,
uh, and then also, uh, behind me
is Peter Kovno who is the uh
secretary uh designee for HED,
um, who's been doing tremendous
work for us. I also note that Mc
Mario Griego and Oscar Vasquez
Butler are our other uh
commissioners out there. Um.
And we greatly appreciate their
service. Um, so we are getting
in our annual appropriation.
It's at $96,000 a year right
now, um, just a warning, we will
probably be visiting you in the
future to up that as costs
increase, tuition increases,
salaries increase, and we'll
talk a little bit about that,
uh, with the bill as well. Um,
the commission has uh uh
promulgated our own rules for
running this program HED has
promulgated the regulations to
run this program, uh, UNM has an
MOU in place uh to administer.
these funds, so they're moved
from the legislature to HED to
UNM we do the distribution and
then uh currently UNM is
handling the contracts with the
legal service providers. Um,
So on this last page here, I'll
just uh give you the quick
highlights of the changes that
we're hoping to achieve today
with you. Um, so in the original
bill, and some of this is just
sort of sorting out
responsibilities that, you know,
in the original draft, um, you
know, until you, until you're
doing something you don't really
recognize exactly who should be
doing what. So, in this case,
um, uh, originally the bill
called for the higher education
department to advertise the
program to the students. We'd
like to change that to the
school of law. We're there,
we're with the students, we know
them, um.
We, we, we can actually recruit,
you know, when we know they're
interested.
Um, the administration of the
contracts with the legal service
providers is currently um the
obligation of the commission,
um, the commission is just a 5
member board. Uh, we, you know,
other than the administrator
should administrative help that
comes from um my, my center, um.
You know, we really don't have
the kind of administrative
capacity to to deal with these
contracts. So we'd like to
change that from the commission
to the school of law, um, where,
where, you know, we can utilize
the greater resources there.
Um, the selection of the
students is currently done by
the commission recommending
students to the higher education
department, the higher education
department makes that selection.
Uh, we think it makes more sense
for the commission to make that
choice because the commission
meets the students, they
interview them and such.
Um
This is, this is an important
one for us. Um, currently, the
definition of who can be a legal
service provider is fairly
limited to nonprofits that
provide free legal services that
relate to, to these constituents
or the university school of law
where we have a law school
clinic that serves these
constituents. Uh, we'd like to
expand that definition to
include state agencies, in
particular the Department of
Justice, uh, where we would love
to play students within the
Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo
division.
to serve these constituents. Um,
and then we also would like to
add counties and municipalities
that have colonius within their
boundaries. Um, as you know,
colonists are not political
subdivisions. And while it's
easy for us to get legal
representation to Asakias and
land grants because they have
those, those corporate bodies,
um, colonia, it's a little
harder to know who the lawyer
should be working for. So if
you've got a county commissioner
or a county
Attorney who wants to provide
services for colonius, this
would make them eligible.
Um
The current cost share, the 50%
cost, the, the legal service
provider pays towards the
salaries is restricted to
non-state funding currently.
Um, that makes it really hard
for us at the university to, to
bring students into our law
school clinic. It would also
make it hard for, say, the
Department of Justice, um, you
know, the, the, it essentially
requires finding philanthropic
money or federal money.
We know that a lot of money uh
is probably going to be going
away and so eliminating that
requirement that it be
non-state, uh, would really open
up the door to a lot more
opportunities for placements
with these students, um.
Uh, the original bill also had a
um baseline salary calculation
in it. Um, I can tell you in
2019 when this bill was passed,
$50,000 was probably a starting
salary for for lawyers in New
Mexico. I checked with the our
law school advancement folks,
it's around 70,000 now. So um
just to give you a sense, we,
we've just uh simplified that
calculation. We've eliminated it
and I'll show you the language
as we get there. Um, and then
the the the last change that
we've asked um our
representative
are um past or former members of
uh commission, um, are, um,
Uh, uh, are, uh.
Land grant, uh, pardon me, um.
No, I'm sorry. Our, our land
grant member uh is a current or
past member of the Land Grant
Council, um, are uh colonious
members, a member of the
infrastructure board, the
Colonia Infrastructure Board.
Um, our SAEA member is just a
member of any ascentia. And so
we thought we would like to make
those three parallel so our
member we'd also like to have as
a pastor, current member of the
Assea commission. um, that's not
so critical, but uh it would
just align the bill. So those
are the changes we're asking
for. I know that's a lot.
I've laid out for you, um,
almost all of them are captured
in the sub, um uh there there
were one or two that were missed
and we can discuss that as we go
through, but I'll, I'll pause
there for, for questions.
I'm here, um.
Madam Chair, before we go to
questions, um,
We need a kind of make some.
tweaks on the sob.
That are kind of um, so we need
to amend the sub.
And I'd like to kind of have
Uh, Adrian, reflect on what
those changes are and that
they're not really substantive.
In terms of the change itself,
but they are substantive in
terms of what we didn't do with
the sub. So Adrian, if you could
kind of take us through that
page and that line. I'll walk
through this quickly if you've
all got the sub in front of you,
um, uh, I'll just point out
there on page 2, the changes
that are made on page 2 are the
ones that relate to the
advertisement and the student
selection. Those are great. We
really appreciate those changes
being made. Um, take you to page
4.
On page 4, those changes at the
top, uh, all relate to the base
salary and um to um to interrupt
you, is it, is it possible to
make these amendments in
appropriations instead of here.
Um, it's, it's difficult to make
amendments to a sub, uh, so it
makes the process messier. Is it
possible to make these
amendments in a different
committee.
Or in the second committee that
you're still going to next.
Uh, madam chair, if that's your
wish, uh, we, we'd be willing to
kind of
I believe I, I believe, uh, yes,
I believe we prefer for this
committee. Thank you. So let,
can we move forward in
discussion of the committee's
substitute as it stands. OK.
Thank you. I appreciate it.
should I continue running
through them really quickly for
you? I'm sorry. Would you like
me to continue running through
the changes we can just go ahead
and move forward and if you're
ready for questions and comments
from the community. Great, thank
you.
Um
Madam Chair, um, with that, with
that we stand for questions.
Prep, thank you so much for
present for the presentation for
the bill. Um, how many folks in
the room are in favor of the
bill?
And, and do we have any folks
against this bill?
Um, and then we have some folks
online as well. So we'll go
ahead and start taking comments
from inside the room. Again, try
to keep your, your comments a
bit brief with one more, uh,
bill that's coming up, and we're
hoping to get there today if we
can. Thank you.
Uh, Madam Chair, council
members, committee members, uh,
we from the Thomas the land
grant and the El Concerto de las
Mercedes are in full support of
this bill because we do need
attorneys for land grants. We
have lots of issues that we're
dealing with pertaining to water
rights, uh, water rights being
separated from lands, then the
lands.
can only be used for development
and that is negatively affecting
our communities, so we need
these attorneys to get on board
and help us out and move us
forward in what we're trying to
do.
So please, we ask for your
support. Thank you.
Hi, I'm Peter Coat, general
counsel with the Higher
Education department and a
commissioner on the uh
This program, uh, send in full
support of the bill, uh, the,
as, um, the substitute reflects
uh most of the changes that the
committee avoided unanimously or
the commission, sorry,
unanimously unanimously to
support and um I look forward to
the further amendments in the
next committee as well, but send
full sword to the bill. Thank
you.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Arturo
Archuleta with the Mexico Land
Grant Council, uh, the council
has endorsed this legislation is
in full support. Um, there's a
wide variety of services that
can be provided um by these
community governance attorneys
for land grant, Ase and colonist
communities, um, which will help
increase their ability to better
serve their community. So uh
we're, the council's in full
support of this legislation.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Steve
Polao. I'm the president of
Tierra Maria Land Grant.
We used these students to help
us conquer a group of militant
group who took over some land in
the Terra Maria. They were very
helpful. They were instrumental.
We won that case because of
them. They did all the research.
Without them, we wouldn't have
done this.
We need more because there's a
lot of
A lot of uh unlawful type of
takeovers of lands that are
going on and not only in the
Terra Maria but on all the other
land grants. Thank you very
much.
And the Tierra Maria land grant
membership and all the errors in
committee and community support
this. Thank you.
Uh, good morning, Mr. Chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Leonard Martinez. I'm
the president of the San Joaquin
Riochamalangra at Marseilles.
Uh, we stand in full support of
hospitals 24.
Um, as I pointed out by
Representative Mason, we're in a
small rural communities.
Uh
And we're at at that I would
like to say at the state of our
language grants are where legal
questions are popping up.
Uh, so we've set aside so much
money to be able.
To talk to an attorney, um, we,
we have our cemeteries, our
lands are sometimes that are
being infringed on, uh, and we
would go talk to the judge and
says, bring an attorney.
Ah, so.
We stand full support Hospital
24. Thank you.
One or the other, uh, my name is
Joaquinse again, I just wanted
to, uh, offer my support and to
provide a visual um.
You know, some people say our,
our lands are at the mouth of
the Towski Valley, but
when I was little used to tell
me stories of um raising sheep
and garancias and the whole
valley there before it was given
to the Blake family now given to
a billionaire hedge fund owner
and all.
So, so for us,
You know, the reality of, of
economic investment has, has
pitted us against various
industries, no.
Um
You know, about
2 years went by of us asking and
begging and looking for help, so
we didn't have to uh sell land
to hire an attorney, and finally
we were able to get some some
help because uh
$50 million dollar company owner
developer, uh wanted to buy some
land and was trying to force us
to sign a
Piece of paper.
Uh, and luckily we had a clinic
like this, give us advice to
say, well, if you sign this,
you, you, you, you're going
against.
The legal standing of of a court
decision, so.
Um, I just want to give that as
a little example, you know,
these things and and these
services, um, they're just not
just for one land grant, but
therefore hundreds of errors
and, and, and for the future.
Um, you know, and sometimes we
kid around and we say, you know,
as popular as the show
Yellowstone was that we all love
watching and pretending we're
cowboys and vaqueros.
Our reality is we're more like
the Milagro Beanfield war movie
from the, from the 70s, 80s
getting its butt kicked by
Yellowstone. That that's the
reality we're having. So even
with this wonderful clinic, it
took us 2 years to get any help,
and this past summer, we were
able to get a student from this
very program to help, help us
prepare for some stuff that we
have coming up that are.
Hopefully goes in our favor, but
it's gonna be historic. So I
just wanted to offer that as, as
another anecdote that this
service and what's happening
needs to be multiplied and, and
lastly I want to say it's about
relationships.
Um
Even when I'm here or when I'm
meeting with the students from
this clinic, uh,
It's, it's, as my grandpa would
say, it's very uncomfortable.
Because the politics and the
laws make us think in a very
linear way, but the issues we
have are not. They're
traditional, they're circular,
they're relational. So a lot of
times when we're working with
these students or with service
providers.
We have to invest a lot of our
time building a relationship to
understand our values and the
way we function back home on
consensus building collective
leadership, what is true
accountability or we call
Dadouelta.
Right? So this, to me, this
program and these services and
it's just about us getting a
legal service. It's about also
professionals being oriented to
the historical reality here of a
matriarchal cultural process,
right? A land-based people, and
in the Southwest, how many
land-based people are still
here, right? We have
21 to 25 indigenous federally
recognized reservations, and
then there's all this mestizos
who are just in the wind.
That unless it's Cinco de Mayo,
nobody wants to hear from us.
Right? So I, I just wanna really
emphasize this isn't just a
program about us getting
services. It's about also
preparing.
A few at a time, and please give
him more money than they know
what to do with. Give them the
problem of having more money,
more problems. Let them multiply
by 1020 fold. Let there be 5
directors here that maybe one
day come from our land grants,
come through this process and
can sit before you and, and
report on the goodness that's
happening. So with that, I
turned that over.
Madam Chair and, uh, members of
the committee. My name is
Joaquin Romero, and I'm here to
speak on behalf of the New
Mexico Aseca Association in full
support of House Bill 24. Uh,
this bill is essential for
improving the current law
program and it's
Uh, very important for providing
services to land grants and
asseass, this, this will help
preserve our cultural heritage
and provide tangible material
support for all the reasons
listed previously. Thank you.
This is Andrea, excuse me,
Andrea La Cruz Crawford again.
Um,
full disclosure. I am one of the
newest appointees to the
community governance attorney
program.
I also serve as a commissioner
on the New Mexico SA Commission.
So my comments here are actually
um that the New Mexico Asea
Commission fully supports this
bill. Um, I know there's no
other members of the commission
here today, so I wanted to just
inform you of that first. I also
wanted to just express my
gratitude for becoming part of
this. I think this is a very
underutilized program at this
point.
That can really be brought into
the light and provide a lot of
good services um throughout the
state. That's all. Thank you.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, I stated, my name is
Don Gustos and I'm a farmer from
Santa Cruz. I have a firsthand
experience on how beneficial
this program is. This year, we
were sued by members of the EEA,
and if it wasn't for this
attorneys that are provided to
us, we'd be in a world of hurt
right now. So it's not just a
theory, it's a real impact
that's occurring right, right
now where we need to support to
defend our Aseass, to
Tended our land grants and
educate our judicial system on
the rights of our people. Thank
you very much.
Sorry, uh, Peter Kovner, again,
uh there we created an
inadvertent quorum for the
community governance attorney
commission. I just wanted to
take note of that. Thank you.
I will go online if, if you'd
like to make a comment online,
can you please raise your hand
and uh we'll call on you.
Again, if you'd like to make a
comment on House Bill 24, uh,
for our online guests, please go
ahead and raise your hand, and
we can call on you now.
We got through, I think a lot of
our tech issues. Seeing no hands
raised online, we're going to
come over to the committee. Uh,
first up, we have Representative
Lord. Presentative Lord, thank
you, Madam Chair. Thank you,
Representative Garcia. Good to
see you. Thank you to our
experts. Um,
You know, I have learned so much
about New Mexico from the land
grant from being on those
committees because
It's a very long and very rich
history that I wanna to see
preserved.
And
I also always think uh.
Our land grant presidents were
so gracious to invite me to
Matanza's. I'm just saying that
if you really want to get to
know me, I'm Maanza invitation
is probably the best way.
I'm just saying wink wink.
But it, it's, it's um
I, I'm still shocked.
Believe it or not, I run into
people who have no idea what a
land grant is that live here.
I'm just like, how do you know,
not well, so I'm also shocked
when they don't know what a
batons is, but there's people
that really don't understand or
know what a land grant is, and
I feel like our job here is to
make sure that that history is
preserved.
And the way that you do that in
the United States of America is
with money and attorneys.
As you guys all know now.
So I want to make sure that you
guys have everything that you
need, uh, but I do have a few
questions. I should be fairly
simple. So that 95 or $96,000 Me
of Chair and Representative,
that, that's a reoccurring fund
that's already been established,
correct?
Madam Chair, I yield to uh
Adrian to answer that, uh, Madam
Chair, yes, Representative Lord,
that has been established and
we're getting disbursements. OK,
cause I, cause I, I've never
seen a physical impact that is
so positive in my life. It's
like, oh, this is great. There's
no money, no impact. Everything
is fantastic. Vote for the bill
pretty much is I, I've never
seen that.
Uh, I did have a question. Hold
on, where did it go? Um, again,
it maybe it's just the person
doing the analysis, but they
also had a technical issue when
you look at the FIR, so make
sure that that's addressed, that
what you're talking about so the
statements of what's happening
in the bill may not be in the
title, and this is the 2nd time
I've read this, so maybe it's
just a person doing the
analysis, but make sure in the
substitute that you have that so
it matches so you don't run up,
get tripped up on anything. Uh,
there was
One other question, it was a
technical.
Um, oh, OK.
So it said there was a
significant issue and maybe you
can help me with this.
Currently, New Mexico legal aid
is the sole employer approved to
employ community governance and
apparently it looks like
They laid off more than 60
employees and the, the county
governor's attorney A may no
longer be viable. How is that
what's going on with that
situation there, Madam Chair,
I yield to Adrian to answer
that. OK, thank you,
representative, Madam Chair, uh,
Representative Lord. Yeah, that,
that has the potential to impact
our program most definitely. And
so, um, only having one legal
service provider under contract
is, is something that we're
trying to rectify with these
amendments by expanding the the
definition of the legal service
provide.
and eliminating that non-state
cost share requirement will open
up the door for us to have more
than just New Mexico legal aid.
Um, and so, um, we're uh
currently in the process of
talking to and recruiting other
legal service providers with the
hope that this is going to pass,
um, but, uh, yeah, if we were
solely relying on New Mexico
legal aid, we would have to be
doing some serious scrambling
right now. But um our hope is
that we can expand the pool and
give the students, you know,
more opportunities, more choices
of where they could go to work
after school.
Madam Chair and, uh,
representative. I was just.
I just find it interesting that
our legal aid system seems to be
having an issue, and now I'm
gonna try to figure out why not,
not to clog up this, but I just
wonder why is now that an issue
when we have all this money.
In our budget, just saying, you
know, we have money in there.
Uh, that's all I would have. I
support the bill. Thank you for
bringing this forward. Thank
you, Madam Chair. Madam Chair,
Florida, I just may, um, on May
1st at the Socorro County
Fairgrounds, uh, my center, the
Eton Center will be hosting a
Matanza,
everyone here is welcome. Uh,
again, that's the Sequcora
County Fairgrounds on, on May
1st, um, and it's actually an
annual water listening
discussion session that we do.
So, uh,
Hope to see you all there. Madam
Chair, I wrote that down. I was
about to stop you and say she
didn't ask a question. I was
like, I was actually very
important information.
So
Representative Gonzalez.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair. Um,
my question is more of a matter
of clarification. Um, I do think
the service is extremely
valuable, but um in the sub um
on line 17, page 1, you're
talking about allowing counties
and municipalities at least one
designated colonial within their
boundaries, um, and just by
definition, just wanting to make
sure it's inclusive language
that, you know, colonia is not a
political subdivision, but
geographic notation versus on
page 5, you're talking about
it's eligible for a land grants,
Mercedes, as well as Collonius.
Is that?
Language on page one inclusive
of everyone.
I guess my question is, does
every colonial inclusive, does
it have all the land grants that
are?
Madam Chair, um, if that makes
sense. Did I, did I ask that
question?
Um, I have to, uh, Adrian that
kind of reflect on that.
I, I, Madam Chair
Representative, I'm, I'm not
sure I quite understand the
question. So
you're saying that to be
eligible for these funds, um,
the areas have to have at least
one colonial within the
designation.
Does every colonial, does that
inclusive of all the land
grants. So like if somebody
wanted to take advantage of
these funds, is there anybody
that would be excluded with the
language.
Oh
yeah, no, I don't think so.
Yeah, I think, I think this is
all inclusive.
Just making sure that I had a
quick question here. um, I thank
you for the presentation for the
bill. Oh.
OK, um, for the build
everything, I was just curious,
so in here it says you have
about one per year that's able
to participate. Will that
continue with these changes?
Madam chair, it will, um, uh,
until that time when we get the
big appropriation increase and
can achieve 2 a year, which is
um what the cap in the bill in
the act is. Um, but currently
we're just being funded for one
a year.
And that one attorney, uh how
many uh different uh groups or,
or cases, however you quantify
that, how many are they able to
affect in that time period
they're, you, you know, that's a
great question, Madam Chair. Um,
we, we did just have a
presentation from uh um the
first attorney in this program
and uh to be honest, I was kind
of overwhelmed. Um, they had
done work for all three of these
different communities, um, and
so getting to some of
representative Lord's concerns
from earlier, um, almost all of
this work is as intended.
This is community governance, so
the, the initial intent here was
to have them working on issues
that help with things like
complying with their audits with
the Open Meeting Act.
In inspection of public records,
things along those lines. Um, so
we were very pleased to hear
that a lot of that work had been
focused on governance work and
building the, the administrative
capacities of these entities.
Um, so, uh, yeah, we're we're
very pleased with the the amount
of work that's getting done.
That's fantastic. Thank you for
answering. It's really
interesting, uh, administrative
work. It's just so many details,
so it's good that they know
they're having the help they
need. Um, vice chairor such.
