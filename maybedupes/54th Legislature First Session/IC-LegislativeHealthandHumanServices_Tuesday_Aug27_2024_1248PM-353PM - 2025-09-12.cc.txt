Still 3 slices of potato left
and that's it. If anybody wants
3 slices of potato,
um, and there's some shortcakes,
so please don't
go to.
Dr. Aurora, it's always good to
have you with us.
Thank you for joining us today.
So we have Doctor Sanjev Aurora,
the director of Project Echo,
Doctor Carla Thornton, senior
associate director of Project
Echo.
Matthew, Doctor Matthew
Beauchampvi associate director.
And uh
Haven Skin, the deputy director
of the re-entry division from
the corrections department. So
we have, uh, a full array of
people to share with us what's
going on with Project Echo and
how we might be able to help.
Dr. Aurora we'll turn it over to
you.
Right.
Yeah
You, Mr. Chairman.
Senate tribunal, thank you for
this opportunity to present our
work to you.
First of all, I want to start by
expressing my enormous
gratitude.
Uh, for all the support.
This committee has given us over
so many years.
So the work that we're going to
present today.
is really
The fruit
Uh, of all the support you have
given and of course um.
Uh, thank you, uh, Mr. Chairman,
for your personal service to the
legislature over so many years
and
Always pointing us toward the
North Star, to serve the people
of New Mexico.
So I
I think for people who don't
understand echo just a little
bit tell you about how Echo
started what.
I'm a gastroenterologist, a
physician professor at the
University of New Mexico.
And I've been here in New Mexico
since 1993.
And in 2001 I had gone to my
clinic and there was a 43 year
old woman who was sitting in the
clinic. And in the room with her
were two children. There was a
14-year-old boy.
And a 9 year old girl.
So I asked her, how can I help
you? And she said, I have
hepatitis C and I want
treatment.
And there's at least one person
in the room, Senator Hickey, who
knows a lot about this disease.
And um.
Uh, so I said, uh.
I said, how long have you had
it? And she said, I've had it
for 8 years.
So I said, why did you not come
earlier for treatment.
And she said, I live 200 miles
away and there was no
specialist. The treatment was a
chemotherapy, weekly injections
and pills. And, and she said
there was nobody in my rural
community to treat me. There are
no specialists there.
And uh when I had called your
nurse, she said you would have
to make 12 trips, 200 miles each
way to see you.
So I said,
OK, but now what changed for you
that you came today 8 years
later,
Because I've been here all this
time and she said that, um, I'm
having pain here in the right
upper side of my abdomen now and
I can't work and that's a
problem for me right now. So I
need help. So I did an
ultrasound of her liver.
And she had a cancer of her
liver.
Halfway between a golf ball and
a tennis ball, basically. It was
a big cancer. It was too big for
us to remove it through
operations because she had
cirrhosis, there was not enough
good liver, and it was too big
to get a liver transplant, so
she passed away six months
later, leaving these two
children.
And so I was asking myself why
did she die of a disease that I
knew how to treat.
For which the diagnostic tests,
medicines, everything was
available.
And the answer was she died
because the right knowledge
didn't exist at the right place
at the right time. And she
didn't have the ability to get
to the right knowledge.
So now the year is 2003.
My colleague Dr. Carla Thornton,
who's an infectious disease
specialist and we
We are, we are trying to figure
this problem out. There are
28,000 patients with hepatitis C
in New Mexico, already been
diagnosed.
And only 1500 have been treated
and they're trying to come and
see us.
There's an 8 month wait to see
us in our clinic.
And people are driving hundreds
of miles. They're coming too
late, and many are dying from
cirrhosis of the liver or liver
cancer unnecessarily. There are
also 2300 prisoners.
Who have hepatitis C. Now I'm
talking about 2003.
And not a single one has ever
received treatment for hepatitis
C.
And many of them are dying from
this too.
So I developed Project Echo.
To democratize my expertise so
that everybody
In New Mexico could get
treatment for hepatitis C, where
they live.
Because there weren't enough
specialists to treat them.
In that locality.
So that's how Echo was born.
And Echo is based on 4 key ideas
now Echo is being adopted as the
most evidence-based model for
workforce training capacity
building in the world.
But in the beginning, it was
just for hepatitis C.
So if you, if you were to please
move to
slide this is the packet that I
would please focus on.
And there is a
There is a slide says Founding
goals of Project Echo.
We knew one thing.
That this is page number 4. And,
um, we knew one thing, if we
could treat and give
chemotherapy in a rural area or
a prison.
Then we could treat any number
of complex diseases.
Um, in this, in the world with
With echo
So the echo model was based on 4
key ideas. First, we would use
technology.
To leverage the expertise of
university specialists. In this
case it was a liver specialist
like me. It was Doctor Carla
Thornton, an infectious disease
specialist, a psychiatrist.
Pharmacists, because a lot of
these people had mental health
disorders and there was no
psychiatrist there. A lot of
them had addiction and there was
no addiction experts there.
So we set a team together at the
university and we said we would
use something like Zoom. There
was no Zoom, so I.
I purchased for $25,000 a used
Polycom bridge.
And create something like Zoom.
But it was just like Zoom, and I
said we would share our best
practices, so I.
Went around the state of New
Mexico and found 21 primary care
clinicians. These were family
doctors, nurse practitioners and
said, hey, you know, would you
be willing to treat hepatitis C
if we helped you, they said yes.
So I gave them my protocol and
lectures, but they said no, no,
this is chemotherapy, we can't
do this. We are family doctors.
We cannot do this.
So I asked myself, how did you
become an expert in treating
hepatitis C?
When I was doing my fellowship
in Boston in Massachusetts in
gastroenterology and liver
disease. This is how it worked.
I would see a patient.
Present to my professor. I would
see another patient present to
my professor. I did it.
Day after day and after 2 years
they started calling me a
gastroenterologist.
I said, aha, I'm gonna use this
model.
To create new hepatitis C
ologists without them having to
do residency or fellowship or
anything, but they would have
the expertise to treat their
patients. We call this idea
case-based learning. So on the
next slide is a picture of the
first echo.
That we started this is now page
6.
And you can see in the big boxes
the university experts.
And all 21 would join altogether
once a week on a Wednesday
afternoon at 3 p.m.
Always the same, and we would
discuss about 8 patients. They
would present cases to each
other and to us.
Um
And we would all discuss them
together. We call this idea all
teach all learn?
And what we found as we did this
week after week in one year.
They became great experts.
In 18 months, the weight in my
clinic went from 8 months to 2
weeks, and I can sincerely tell
you today, even today, 20 years
later, we are the only clinic at
the University of New Mexico
where the wait is 2 weeks.
Everything else, if you've tried
to make an appointment, you'll
find out. It takes a long time,
right? So, but we were able to
compress this.
And this session we had with
them every Wednesday afternoon,
while Osby is the same. Discuss
78 cases, and then 15 minutes,
give them a lecture on hepatitis
C. That's what I'm doing on
slide 7.
What we started finding on slide
8.
I
Before slide 8, what we found
was Echo was doing something
very surprising, which we had
not anticipated.
That it was producing joy of
work for these rural doctors.
What I mean by that is, it was
their satisfaction was going up.
Isolation was going down and it
was building community for them.
So we had been establishing
communities of practice.
To solve a really big problem in
their community because there
were so many patients untreated.
But all that was good. We
published all that data, but the
most important study we've ever
published in our
Our life of echo of 20 years is
on slide 9, a slide 8.
This is the leading medical
journal in the world called the
New England Journal of Medicine.
It is the hardest journal to
publish in, and we got a paper
in which actually showed.
That these rural doctors and
prison doctors could get exactly
the same outcomes.
As university specialists, if
they participated in ECO.
This paper literally changed the
world in this way that as soon
as this paper was published, I
started getting emails, calls
from all over the world.
That we want to do this for HIV
in Africa and TB in India and so
on and so forth, and the global
rollout of Echo started.
After this paper also.
This committee
And the legislature.
Started supporting us more to
roll out Echo in.
At this point, if you look at
slide 9, we have 647
peer-reviewed publications,
peer-reviewed publications are
publications that are in major
journals which demonstrate that
echo.
Is the most evidence-based
model.
For upskilling the frontline
healthcare provider in the
world. There is nothing even
close, not even with half or
even 1.
1/5 the evidence of this of this
model.
And 82 publications showing that
patient health outcomes improve
and 12 publications showing that
population health outcomes
improve.
So I want to show you what we
have done with all the funding
you have provided us.
So far
This is slide 10.
You know what I described to you
was one hepatitis C network. We
have 65 healthcare networks
going on in New Mexico right
now.
For our citizens.
65 active healthcare programs,
so
If you look at the slide number
11.
You'll see what we're doing
there. Aces stands for adverse
Childhood Events echo alcohol
use and mental health echo. I'm
growing horizontally from the
top. bone health echo for
osteoporosis.
Care of the older patient.
Child and adolescent mental
health echo.
Colorectal cancer screening
echo.
Dermatology echo, you know,
there are almost no
dermatologists in rural areas.
It's very hard to find a
dermatologist to see you. And if
you have Medicaid or you have no
insurance, it's almost
impossible to see a specialist.
What we are doing is we are
taking specialty care close to
their home, so their primary
care doctor can provide this
care, so I will not read all the
65 healthcare programs we are
running, but this is a record
you have for yourself. We do all
of this work in New Mexico, and
we have another 12 planned.
To start by
June of 2025.
You'll meet two of my colleagues
who actually are involved in
running New Mexico programs and
certainly we'll all be here to
ask you questions later on.
But one of the things, uh, Mr.
Chair and members of the
committee that I found.
When we looked at the
literature, we found that
education of a child.
Is the best predictor of the
healthcare status of that child
when they grow up.
It's even a better predictor
than how much money
The family has.
Because if they are educated, if
the child gets a good education,
then.
They know what to do.
And one of the challenges we
were facing was right now, even
today, only 40% of children in
3rd grade can read in New Mexico
and after the 3rd grade, they
only tell you.
What to read, not how to read.
And there is an evidence-based
method to do this.
It's also called the science of
reading or the letters project
or many, many things. We are now
adopting it in our state, but we
decided that we would mentor
school teachers.
To be better school teachers
just like we were mentoring
doctors.
By now what has happened just to
give you an idea.
The echo model has become so big
globally. It has been adopted
for 75 disease areas, but it is
in 209 countries and areas and
territories everywhere in the
world, so there are only 203
countries in the world just to
But that, but there are places
like the state of Palestine or
the Holy See, which is not a
country, but these are
territories.
They all have echo.
We have 6.2 million learners all
over the world doing echo.
Being run by their own
ministries of health and
executive branches and not for
profits and academic
universities and all the major
universities in the United
States have also adopted a code
to democratize their expertise.
So we have now 26 active
education programs and 6 new to
start.
If you please go to.
Page number 13.
This is a map of New Mexico
which shows you.
That with all your support over
the years, we have trained
22,000 unique.
Healthcare workers, doctors,
nurses, nurse practitioners,
community health workers, we
have trained 22,000 unique
individuals.
And we've trained them 260,000
times, basically.
So the average
Number of times these 22,000
people have attended Echo
training sessions of an hour or
two.
Is almost 15.
They really like it. They don't
get paid for it. They come on
their own time, because they
feel supported and they learn
new things and they feel they
can do a better job with their
patients.
on your
On, on slide
number 14.
is what we have done in each
county and what we have
distributed to you is this one
page sheet like this, and I just
wanted to mention how to read
this.
This, what has been given you is
what's going on in your
district.
So
On the top left is what is the
number of unique learners you
have in.
Healthcare
The 2nd row from the top is how
many unique learners you have in
the field of education. That is
how many school teachers in your
area are participating in ECO
because we have
Mentored more than 2200 school
teachers too, to be better
teachers.
On the right side you'll see a
word called attendances. How
many times have these unique
individual learners participated
in sessions. That's what we mean
by attendances.
And so you can see overall the
latest data now is the total
number of attendances.
In New Mexico is 287,000.
We also give CME credits and I
would, I would skip now to
slide.
16
And 17 together I'll handle.
One is often asked this question
that you are doing workforce
training.
But we've been doing training of
doctors.
Since the days of Jesus Christ.
So the question is what is so
different about your training?
That makes it so unique. So in
this slide that I'm trying to
show you is
The first is echo is.
Creates very deep learning.
Of implementation of best
practice.
So there is a guideline, there
is a best practice.
We can share it, which is
knowledge sharing. That's the
first step.
The second step is they have to
apply that knowledge.
And present a case back of
actual patient in their practice
is presented back to us. They
have to reflect on what we've
taught them.
The 3rd step is they go and
implement that knowledge and
come every week and telling us
how it's going on. So that's the
3rd step of implementation of
the knowledge.
And what we found is as they
implement this knowledge, they
get new independent insights of
how what works and what doesn't.
Then they share back.
The community. This is called Al
Teach all learn.
They become the teachers.
And then we have a software
program which gives them
feedback.
On how each session is going.
So this creates a circular loop
of deep learning.
Which is based on implementation
expertise building, and that's
what makes
As different
The slide 17 is basically saying
that Project Echo turns
traditional training on its
head.
On the left side is the
traditional way of training. We
do workshops, webinars.
We have participants, learners
traveled to the university to
get 5 days of training.
We
We have learning discussions by
experts.
On the right side is what Echo
does. Echo creates a virtual
platform.
Echo is what we call the drip
irrigation method of training.
So the traditional training, Mr.
Chair, is that you take a
garden.
And once a year you're allowed
to water it for 5 days.
And then you come back 6 months
later and say why are the
Flowers not growing.
What echo is, it's a weekly drip
irrigation method of training
and implementation support.
That's one difference.
The second is
It's an ongoing virtual
community of practice. It's not
just one person.
Attending a curriculum, becoming
a certification, and then trying
to implement it.
There is ongoing mentorship as
they implement something
complex. Medicine is very, very
complicated.
And one of the differences in
learning medicine versus
carpentry, for example.
Is your tolerance for error is
very low.
You, you, you can't say, look, I
can do this well 98% of the
time. Guess what?
Then every time you see 100
patients you're going to make 2
major mistakes and it's going to
be a big problem for you. You're
gonna lose your license after a
little bit. So because the
tolerance of error is so low.
You need ongoing mentorship and
support if you're going to
implement new best practices
and, and doing that. It, it is
very similar to trying to fly a
plane where again
Tolerance for error is very low.
You can't have a 1% error rate
or 1 in 1000 error rate. So
that's why doctors shy away from
something that they're not
totally confident with Echo
because we are holding their
hand as they implement, they do
it and.
In Echo for hepatitis C. I
mentioned there were only 1500
patients treated when we
started. Now we treated more
than 10,000 patients in the
state.
And there were 0 prisoners
treated.
And we have traded, would you
say 1500 prisoners total or more
than that, we'll give you the
exact numbers, so.
We've been able to truly
democratize this expertise and
its implementation.
The other thing different about
About echo traditional training,
it creates contextually relevant
information.
So traditional training is I as
an expert.
Train the learners.
I know that stuff to train.
Here what we do is we marry the
local expertise of the primary
care clinician because they know
the culture.
They know the resource
constraints. They know what lab
tests, medicines are available.
They know what the family wants,
what the patient wants.
This local
Cultural and resource knowledge
when married to expert
knowledge, which we call all
teach or learn.
is what creates contextually
relevant learning how to apply
it.
The other thing what Echo has
which other training doesn't
have.
It's a weekly feedback loop on
the system.
Every week,
These learners express needs,
those needs are met.
And when we train them, they
have questions, and this
feedback loop and then our
software program is also
assessing.
How effective it is. So all of
this creates a whole new
platform, which is why this has
become
The
The, the best workforce training
capacity mill and I'm so
grateful to all of you because
you helped develop it, you
supported it. That's why we have
65 Healthcare networks and 26
education networks, and I want
to invite my colleague.
Dr. Matthew Buchanville to the
table here.
Um, Matt, please come and sit
here and, um, he's gonna give
you an actual example.
Of a disease which affects so
many New Mexicans, and he'll
tell you more.
Which is killing people and how
what he has been able to
accomplish in New Mexico for
that one disease.
Thank you. Good afternoon.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. It's a
it's an honor to be here to talk
about our work at Echo and the
diabetes space. I'm a diabetes
specialist at UNM and I've been
working with Project Echo for
over 10 years. numbers right.
Thank you for context, we are on
slide 19, and if you'll allow me
to uh share a little bit of
context about diabetes before we
dive into our echo work in this
space. Uh, what, what you'll see
on slide 20 is some data from uh
from New Mexico demons.
frustrating that the the
diabetes trends are on the rise,
not only that, but in more
recent years, New Mexico were
actually outpacing the rest of
the country in terms of the, the
average number for uh new, new
diabetes diagnoses.
And uh you can kind of get a
sense from the, the curves there
on this graph where we're
headed, but I really, I think
the next slide, slide 21, is
even more telling. And, uh,
because there are lots of
different uh projections for
where we're headed with respect
to diabetes, but I think the
most telling is you look at
uh people today who are at very
high risk of having diabetes
tomorrow if they don't do
something about it. And those
are people with pre-diabetes,
and it turns out that
More than 1 in 3 adults, which
that's a lot, uh, actually I
have pre-diabetes, but uh what's
even more worrisome is that the
vast majority of us don't even
know we have it, so more than 8
out of 10 people with
pre-diabetes doesn't even know
that they have pre-diabetes. So
of course, if you don't know
that you have prediabetes,
you're not going to be doing
much work to prevent
progression. So it gives you a
sense of where we're headed. And
if you look at implications in
New Mexico, this is uh some
data.
From the, the American Diabetes
Association.
Uh, they, they shared some data
showing that today in New Mexico
we're we're spending $2 billion
per year just on diabetes care
and a big portion of that is,
is, uh, is the expense around
complications of diabetes,
things like the eye disease, the
kidney damage, heart damage, uh,
heart disease is the leading
cause of death in New Mexico and
then not to mention all of the
all of the deaths associated
with diabetes.
And this is a a global problem,
of course, not, not just in New
Mexico and globally there are
over 40,000 deaths per year from
non-communicable diseases. And
just like these complications
here, many of these deaths are
preventable. Um, so that's,
that's the good news of this
slide is these, these are
preventable complications of
diabetes, and the next slide is
really the, the ADA, uh, kind of
a, a streamlined version.
Of the ADA algorithm for how we
prevent these complications and
what you can see is that over
recent years there's been a
tremendous rapid advancement in
diabetes therapeutics and
diabetes technology.
But the point I want to make
here is that it's a double-edged
sword, these advancements, so
great, great for people with
diabetes if they can have access
to these newer therapeutics, but
also, as you can probably get a
sense from this slide, diabetes
care has become exquisitely
complex to the point that it's
much more difficult now for
people to to manage diabetes and
follow best uh clinical practice
guidelines. And so it might not
be a surprise that if we look at
the next slide.
showing how do these
advancements actually translate
to diabetes care quality
outcomes in the US and what
we're looking at here is, uh,
these are he measures we're
looking at hemoglobin A1C
values, a blood test that tells
us how well we're doing with
diabetes care and we're not
budging the, the, we're not
moving the dial at all, uh,
despite these advancements in
diabetes care.
And uh there are many reasons
for this, and we're going to
dive into this next, but the,
the point I want to make is that
not only is this a problem in
the nationally, nationally and
globally, but it's a particular
problem for people living in
rural communities with diabetes
and uh hopefully you can get the
sense from these two slides,
background slides that people
with diabetes living in rural
communities compared to their
urban peers are not experiencing
the same benefit in terms of
mortality.
In terms of, uh, improvement in
other risk factors for heart
disease like blood pressure,
cholesterol, and, uh, so what
this means if we, uh, just to
segue into the echo model on
slide 27.
Is that uh diabetes care is
really falling on, on the
primary care workforce. The
solution is not that, well, we
just need to get these patients
in to see a specialist. There
aren't enough specialists. And
so at the American Diabetes
Association meetings uh just a
couple of months ago, one of the
main take home points from that
conference was that look, we, we
can't get all these people in to
see a specialist. So the
solution is we need to, we need
to build up the primary care
workforce, make them
comfortable.
Treating complex diabetes
because 90% of people in the US
with diabetes are cared for by
PCPs rather than diabetes
specialists.
The problem is if you ask a
primary care provider how they
feel about that because of those
guidelines I just showed you,
the rapid advancement in
therapeutics, they don't feel
equipped to manage diabetes
adequately. But if you ask the
solution because they they
recognize there's not enough
access to a diabetes specialist.
It's many months to get in to
see a diabetes specialist. PCP's
report that case coaching and a
multi-disciplinary collaborative
approach can overcome these
barriers.
And I, I think that's a powerful
statement because that's exactly
what Project Echo is. It's a
solution for just what the ADA
is is pitching. How do we
support the primary care
workforce around diabetes care
and Echo can do this. And so we
launched a diabetes echo in New
Mexico. We call it endo echo for
endocrinology, about 10 years
ago, and it allows us to do just
this, so the, the clinicians on
the front lines of community
care are presenting their real
patients with diabetes.
They're receiving feedback from
their peers and and from
specialists on the network.
And so we, uh, from the
University of New Mexico Health
Sciences Center. We recruited a
panel of specialists and we
partnered with uh with
clinicians and community health
workers at federally qualified
health centers around, around
New Mexico and uh it's been a
very well attended program. I'm
just sharing some data,
attendance data from the last
year with you here, uh, just
making the point that it's a
very robust virtual community of
practice. And if we
Look at the impact of the
program, um, starting with the
impact on clinicians who are
tuning in to the ECO program and
for context, this is slide 32.
Uh, what, what we're finding is
that the clinicians are much
more confident in their ability
to manage diabetes. They're,
they're much more likely to
implement best practices, the,
the new complex guidelines than
they were before participating.
They're not having to refer as
many patients out to see a
specialist. They're able to
treat patients in the
communities where they live
rather than refer them out.
And in fact, the clinicians that
are participating in the echo
are being recognized by their
peers as local specialists and
they're even receiving referrals
from their colleagues to manage
people with complex diabetes.
If we, if we look at the out the
impact on patients with diabetes
living in rural communities in
New Mexico we talked to them and
what you can see on slide 33 is
they are reporting benefits
across the board in terms of
their confidence and their
ability to manage their
diabetes, uh, their, they're
satisfaction with their care,
their, uh, what we call
activation. They're activated to
they're motivated to make
behavior change, quitting
smoking, monitoring
Their blood sugars, improving
their diet. We, we looked at
Medicaid claims data showing
that patients treated by PCPs
that are mentored through Echo
are more likely to experience
improved quality metrics around
prescriptions, diabetes
prescriptions, then their peers
in the community who are treated
by non-participating PCPs.
When we look at harder outcomes
like things like like A1C, blood
pressure and cholesterol. We, we
looked, uh, so now we're going
to transition to slide 35. And
this is a table looking at
characteristics of, of patients
with diabetes in the community,
the rural communities treated by
ecotrain providers versus our
specialist-led clinic at UNM,
our diabetes clinic, and the
take home points I, I put in the
margin here, but the point is
that.
With echo, we are reaching a
very different population than
those that are coming into the
specialist clinic at UNM. So
we're reaching, uh, a population
that's predominantly Hispanic,
more likely to be Spanish
speaking and, uh, arguably need
more help than those that are
coming to see the specialist,
their A1C at baseline blood
pressure, cholesterol, things
were tended to be uh not as much
in their favor at baseline. But
when we followed them over time
these
These patients in rural New
Mexico who were treated by Echo
Train PCPs. We found that they
improved dramatically if we look
at A1C, they were starting at a
much higher place where in slide
36 now, but they actually, they
caught up with the, uh, the
other group. And usually when
you do that, you're ramping up
therapies that like insulin that
tend to cause weight gain, but
they actually didn't experience
the the same weight gain that
that our patients at the
specialist clinic experience, so
they.
fared better
Uh, we, we found that
improvements in blood pressure
and cholesterol were similar
between both groups. And if you
remember the slide I showed you
at the beginning, showing that
we're not moving the dial on A1C
nationally. That is not the case
in New Mexico with patients
treated by EcoTrain providers
and what we're seeing on slide
37 is that they're, they're
moving, they're those that were
uh that we're meeting the
heatest definition of
uncontrolled diabetes.
We're much more likely than
patients at the the specialist
clinic at UNM to no longer be
uncontrolled, uh, and much more
likely to transition to control
than those at the specialist
clinic. So they're actually
doing better than our than our
own patients that I that I'm
seeing in the clinic.
We, uh, this, I'm gonna step
outside of New Mexico for just a
moment on slide 39, making the
point that when you improve a
bunch of uh things like A1C,
blood pressure, and cholesterol,
you prevent very costly
complications of diabetes and
our partners in New Jersey who
launched a diabetes echo where
we're able to demonstrate
through Medicaid data that their
PCPs participating in their
diabetes echo, their patients
are uh experiencing lower health
care.
Cost then peers treated by
non-Ecotrain providers.
So the, the last point I'll make
before I, I pass the baton to
Doctor Thornton, is that, uh, it
was really striking how much
better the echo cohort did than
our own cohort at the specialist
clinic, and we believe that it's
because they're receiving care
in the communities where they
live by a trusted primary care
clinician in collaboration with
the community health worker
that's also being skilled up
through the echo model. And in
fact, my last slide, slide 42, I
just
Want to mention that through our
work with Project Echo and in
collaboration with the
Department of Health, we
launched a, uh, we, we set the
stage for certification of
community health workers that
ultimately led to where we are
this year, where CHW's will be
able to receive reimbursement
for their services.
And with that, we'll we'll pass
on to Doctor Thornton and thank
you for your attention.
You can go back
Exactly
Thank you, Matt.
Good afternoon, everyone. Um,
I'm really happy to be here to
talk to you about some programs
that I'm involved in and Echo
that I feel very passionate
about, as Sanjeev mentioned, I'm
an infectious diseases physician
and
And I'll talk a little bit more
about that and a couple of other
programs that I've been involved
in. So I'm gonna start with
flight 44.
Um, I, if you see on the left,
and I, I think since you've
showed a picture, uh, of how a
slide of this, but this is the
hepatitis C community echo that
we've been had, had for the
last, um, 20 years, and we've
had over 1200 unique attendees
in our New Mexico Echo hepatitis
C echo sessions who are now
treating hepatitis C all over
the state of New Mexico and as
you can see we're, we have
coverage of most counties in New
Mexico. Um, we've had this
weekly session since 2004 at the
exact same time.
Every week, 3 o'clock on
Wednesdays. It's never changed.
So we we have some people who
partner with us who have been
there for almost 20 years, which
is really amazing to see the
people continue to be involved
in our echo session.
Um, if for those of you who
don't know a lot about hepatitis
C in New Mexico has one of the
highest rates of hepatitis C in
the country. Um, we're second to
Oklahoma and that's about it.
Everyone else has lower rates of
hepatitis C. So we have a huge
hepatitis C problem in our
community.
At the same time that we started
the community echo.
Hepatitis C echo sessions. We
also partners with the
Department of Corrections at
that time, and they were
involved in the New England
Journal of Medicine study that
that Sanjeev actually talked to
you about, um, they were, we
started a separate, they wanted
to have a separate echo session
because of the, because it was
in the prison and it was a
different situation. So we had,
we had our echo session with,
um, the, the Department of
Corrections on a different day
for an hour and we would sit
with them and we would, they
would present cases in the, in
the
Using the echo model and we
really guided the hepatitis C
treatment starting in 2004 as
well.
Um, the Department of Questions
has been an amazing partner with
us. We worked with them to, um,
they started testing for
hepatitis C routinely, what they
call opt-out testing. So
everyone who walks through the
door of a New Mexico prison gets
tested for hepatitis C, and so
we know a lot about how much
hepatitis C there is in our
prison system. And
unfortunately, um, we have the
highest rate of hepatitis C in
our prisons of any, any prison
system in the country that we
know about, there are some
people, there are some prisons
who aren't testing routinely, so
we don't
know the answer to that, but we
think that we have the highest
rate. And what, what we see
still coming into the prison
system is that every, the 50% of
the people who walk through the
door of the prison system have
been exposed, meaning their body
has seen the hepatitis C virus.
Some of them fight it off, but
the vast majority still have it,
so about 30% of people in the
prison system right now have
what we call hepatitis C
viremia. They have virus in
their bloodstream at this time.
So it is an absolutely huge
problem in our, in our prison
system, and we'll talk a little
bit.
about that. Um, we,
So we started these at the same
time, as I said, they were both
involved in the New England
Journal of Medicine study. And
so it was just as safe to treat
them in a prison setting as it
was to treat them at our
specialty clinic as well, which
we were very excited to have, to
know, to know that. Um, just a
couple of things about hepatitis
C in prisons. The CDC estimates
that, that about 40% of people
who are infected with hepatitis
C, go in and out of a carcal
setting in a, in a given year.
So it's a really, really
important place to focus.
Hepatitis C treatment and, and
testing is in the prison, prison
and jail systems.
And I'm going on to now to um,
slide the next slide, slide 45.
I just want to talk a little bit
about what's happened in terms
of hepatitis C treatment over
time in the prison system, if
you look at the graph, this
starts in 2015 and for those of
you who aren't aware of the
newer medications for hepatitis
C, they were actually released
in 2014. Before that, we were
using very, very difficult to
use medication called
interferon. Very hard to treat.
It only cured about 50% of
people.
And in 2014, the, the
introduction of these new
medications, um, oral
medications that were 8 to 12
weeks of treatment basically to
cure the hepatitis C virus. But
even at that time, we, we still
were treating not that many
people in the prisons because we
did, they were very expensive,
these medications. So in 2020,
um, we, um, because of the
generous support of the
legislature, the $20 million
that was given to the Department
of Corrections, we were able to
really ramp up hepatitis C
treatment dramatically in the
Prison system, which we've been
very excited about. So as you
can see on the, that's, um, on,
on slide 45, we, we're going to
treat about 800 people this year
in the prison system and we've
treated close to a little bit
over 3000 over time. So it
sounds, it's a lot, and I wish
that it were, we were getting
rid of hepatitis C in the prison
system, but we're making a huge
dent in the problem. And the
more the, the fewer people that
have hepatitis C virus in their
bloodstream, the less.
Uh, transmission there is of
hepatitis C in the prison and in
the community because we know
that 90% of people
who are incarcerated in our
prison system come out into the
community. So it's really, it's,
we're focusing on the prison,
but it's really impacting our
community overall.
Um, I'm gonna go on to side 46.
So one of the other things that
came out of the work in
hepatitis C in the prison is
that we were, we would hear on a
regular basis about people being
infected with hepatitis C while
they were in prison. We know
there's high risk. We know
there's a lot of virus, we know
that there's high risk behavior.
There's a lot of tattooing, and
people can get infected easily
with sharing tattoo equipment.
So we we heard about all of
these new infections in the
prisons, so we started a program
which is now 15 years old called
the New Mexico Peer Education
Project, and our motto was
prisoner help this community
health because, as I said, we
believe that
People, treating people perhaps
C in the prison is very
important because it actually
impacts the impacts their lives,
but it impacts the community as
well.
Um, so we started this project,
like I said, back in 15 years
ago and on slide 47,
We'll talk a little bit about
how this program works and we
have, we are in every prison in
New Mexico, the 11 prisons in
New Mexico, we go into the
prison, we take a team of
trainers in and we train people
to be peer educators, peer
health educators in the prison
system.
It's a very intensive 40-hour
training where they learn a lot
of medical facts, but they also
learn how to be, they learn
about adult learning theory,
they learn how to, to teach
their peers basically who are
also adults. So they, they, it's
a very intense training and up
in the, um, the slide before
that there was a picture of the
graduating class.
So we train, we train them for
40 hours and then we leave and
we have contact with them and
I'll talk about that in a
minute, but we continue to have
contact with them on a regular
basis, but they are the ones who
are responsible for doing the
education in the prison for
around these, these, um, the
health things that they learn
about. And we started it because
of hepatitis C, but they also
teach about some diabetes about
staph infection in the, in the
skin about sexually transmitted
infections and things like that.
And in addition to, um,
When we go out to visit them and
we continue our relationship
with them, we have a twice
monthly echo session. It's a
little bit different than what
And you've described, because
we're not, they're not
presenting patients, but we
teach them, we do some sort of
education for them and then they
will present a problem that's
going on with their peer
education, uh,
With, with, with their group
basically, so if they they're
having trouble getting people to
come to classes, they'll present
this as a case and then they'll
get input from all of the other,
um,
Prisons around, so who who've
had the same kind of problems.
So it's been a very interesting,
interesting project. And if you
go to the next slide,
I'm not gonna go through all of
these numbers, but we have, um,
trained over 1000 peer educators
in the last 15 years and
they've, like I said, we're in
all prisons, they've, um, we, we
estimate that they've educated
about 30,000 other inmates on
these health issues,
particularly hepatitis C, but a
lot of other things as well.
And this model has been
recognized by several other
states as being a, a, a, an
excellent model for, for doing
training in prison systems. So
the Indiana prison system came
down and they went to one of our
session, our 40-hour trainings
and they've replicated this in
their prison system as well. The
state of Tennessee, um, and
Colorado is now in the process
of also replicating this, the
peer education project.
So, because of the success of
what we call Nim PPEP, the New
Mexico Department of Corrections
actually came to us. It was, it
was 2019 when they first
approached us about it, but they
wanted us to do something
similar to the New Mexico peer
Education project in the
community. And so we, this was,
uh, you know, what happened in
2019, but it was a little bit
difficult, but we got things
going and most of it was virtual
at the time. We started what's
called the Community peer
education project. And this is
a, um,
A very different program that
has some of the same, uh,
Ideas and some of the same, um,
goals. So we currently have on
the next slide on, on slide 49,
we currently have, um, 12.
Community peer educators that
are all over the state. And
they're, when they, there are
people who are formally
incarcerated and a lot of them
were formerly peer educators in
the prison. When they come out,
we hire them on contract to help
people coming out of
incarceration with re-entry. So
they do, and you can, um, see on
the next slide, there's a lot,
they do a lot for them. They,
they work with them and they can
help them get their GED. They
can work, they, they,
I'm not going to go through the
support services, but they work
one on one with people coming
out of prison to help them with
the very difficult reentry
process. And again, I'm not
going to read the numbers, but
there's been thousands and
thousands of peer to peer
engagement. Um, we, they do, in
addition to the one on one peer
to peer engagement. They do
workshops. They do virtual
workshops with people coming out
of incarceration just to help
them and teach them things, um,
they, they, they work on
employment, housing, um, they, a
lot of
them if they haven't been
treated for perhaps in the
prisons and they will refer them
to they can tell them where to
get their Hep C treated and to
find medical care.
So this has been a very
successful program and, and,
like I said, it came as a,
at the request of the
corrections department because
they, they had seen the success
of the peer education program in
the prison system.
Last couple of slides I wanted
to mention the most, the most
recent thing that we've done
with, um, justice involve
populations is we started just a
couple of months ago and echo to
help providers and staff in
detention and jails, basically
county jails to teach them
about, um, opiate use disorder
and the treatment of opiate use
disorder and sort of
Help the transition as we know
this, that all of the the
detention centers and the prison
are going to be offering MOUD,
but we wanted to just to make a
platform and a community of
practice where people in jail in
the jail setting could learn
from each other. So this has
been really great. We've had 5
sessions, um, that there have
been 5 cases presented, so
they're, they're, we asked them
to bring either a, a,
A de-identified patient case or
something about the situation
that they need help with. Um,
and it's been, been very, very
interesting. And this slide 51
shows you, uh, the jails from
all over New Mexico are joining,
and they often they like I said,
the providers and their staff
will be there, but also there's
a lot of detention center
administrators that come. So
they can also hear what's going
on and what are the issues
around rolling out, um,
addiction treatment in in the
jail setting.
And then the last two slides
that I want to talk about, slide
52, so that's about our
hepatitis C work and our justice
involved work. I just wanted to
point out that we, you know,
we've been
from 12 to 1 we would give
basically updates to about what
was going on with COVID and I
just, this slide just shows the
COVID rate of hospitalization
for COVID patients and the
attendance for our COVID
infectious diseases office
hours. Um, on the, the
right-hand side of the slide.
And so that was a very, very
successful echo. It's, it's not
exactly a traditional echo
because patient case, there are
not patient cases presented, but
it was more of a, this is we
really need to get all this
information out to people and we
had a lot of attendance from all
over New Mexico. It was a very
successful echo. When COVID was
not such a huge public health
problem anymore.
The our participants really
wanted to continue the echo, so
we actually decided to make it
now what we call infectious
diseases, office hours where we
Continue to talk about COVID
when, when it's important like
now when there's a lot of COVID
cases. But we also talk about
emerging infectious diseases in
New Mexico like H5N1 and things
that are really important to
the, to the state as a whole.
And lastly, on the last slide,
slide 53,
another very important public
health problem in New Mexico,
um, right now is syphilis, and
the, the rates of syphilis, for
those of you who don't know,
have really gone up dramatically
in the last couple of years and
we unfortunately in New Mexico
have the 2nd highest rate of
syphilis, and the second, the
most, I think we actually have
the highest rate of congenital
syphilis. So syphilis babies
that are born with syphilis. And
so the, the, you know, the
department.
Department of Health.
Put out a public health, um,
mandate back in 2023 to test all
adults aged 18 to 50 for
syphilis, no matter if they had
risk factors or not, because we
obviously weren't, we used to
test people based on what they
told you they did, but that's,
we knew that that was not a good
way to do it anymore. So we, we,
we talked about that. We, we
decided to have a syphilis, um,
echo, basically, and we, we
stood this up for 8 sessions. We
just wanted to get all of the
information.
Out there for people and we,
people could present cases if
they wanted to, but a lot of it
was just discussion, um, about
what was going on with syphilis
and how to approach the problem.
And we had the Department of
Health was on as one of our hub
team members. So we worked very
closely with them and, um,
To, to, to get the information
that we felt like was needed out
about syphilis. And we're also
considering right now actually
continuing this is an ongoing
thing because the, the syphilis
epidemic has really
unfortunately continued to grow
and so we, we feel like that we
need to, to address public
health problems as they arise as
well.
So I think that is my last slide
and thank you so much, Mr. Chair
and members of the committee
for, for letting me present to
you about these programs.
And thank you, Carla, Mr.
Chairman, members of the
committee, I'd like to invite
Haven Scoogan to come in.
Talk about her perspective from
the Department of Corrections.
Just to repeat, she's the deputy
director of the re-entry
division, but also oversees all
the education activities of
prisoners in our prison system.
Excellent, thank you so much.
Uh, good afternoon, um, Mr.
Chair and members of the
committee, I'm grateful to be
here and speak in support of our
relationship with Project Echo
that as Dr. Thornton and Dr.
Aurora mentioned has been one
for over 20 years at this point.
Um, the New Mexico Corrections
Department has built a
relationship with ECO that began
with hepatitis C services as the
primary mission, but has
expanded into so much more with
ECO providing peer support
services.
to our inmate population or
population on probation and
parole in the community on
topics like hepatitis C, general
public health issues, substance
addiction and re-entry services,
which are topics that are very
pertinent to the criminal
justice population that we
serve.
This collaboration between UNM
and NMCD has resulted in the
expansion of this evidence-based
education that has benefited
thousands of our inmates and
clients on probation and parole
supervision at this point.
As a probation and parole
officer, and I often, when, when
we were speaking about this
presentation today, I often
think that the why is really
important when you're wondering
why to continue funding
something, why are we continuing
this collaborative partnership.
Um, when I was a probation and
parole officer years ago, I
worked with a client on
supervision whose health was
failing because of a hepatitis C
diagnosis.
He struggled with day to day
function. He was struggling,
maintaining employment, and
being able to function in his
life and with his family.
Through medical intervention.
I watched as he worked with the
University of New Mexico
receiving treatment and over the
course of the next few months,
he became a different man.
He was able to regain his life.
And to me this is the power of
healthcare.
And the importance of ensuring
that those in our communities
are able to function in a way
that allows them to meaningfully
engage in their families and in
their lives. For inmates and
clients on supervision,
healthcare is often an
afterthought.
It is something that is not
generally the priority of their
lives.
What Project Echo has done for
our inmate population and for
our population on probation and
parole supervision has to, has
been to create a safe
environment for sharing
information about public health
in a way that our clients can
hear.
And it encourages our clients to
take a more active role in their
own personal healthcare.
For NMCD, peer services provides
a valuable resource to the
population by providing a voice
that NMCD does not have.
It provides our clients with
supportive community that
enables and empowers our
population to play an active
role in the management of their
own healthcare and well-being.
Through shared experiences, the
message is heard in a different
way from a peer as it's being
communicated oftentimes by
someone who's walked in their
shoes. An individual with lived
experiences who can speak to the
journey.
Working for many years with
probation and parole.
As an officer with NMCD, I found
that sometimes my message was
not heard by my clients. I could
encourage a parolee to attend
treatment. I could encourage
someone to stay sober. I could
have them follow the conditions
of their supervision. But that
didn't always work.
Through Echo, having a peer
support a client, helps reduce
the anxiety of the unknown and
assist the client in hearing a
message of sobriety coming from
someone who's actually gotten
sober.
It helps them understand that
overcoming addiction, addressing
health issues is possible and it
helps them see that sobriety is
Available in their own life.
They gain hope in themselves.
And are able to build their own
strengths to overcome their own
addictions and create a life of
sobriety on their own.
I think having hope matters.
Hope that sobriety is possible,
that they can be successful and
turn their lives around and that
to me is what peer support
services have done for the
population. Create an example of
hope in the eyes of our inmate
population and to the clients
who we actively serve on
probation parole in the
community.
I think one of the big benefits
that NMCD has seen through our
relationship with ECO is
obviously, you all have heard a
lot about hepatitis C treatment.
Is the hepatitis C treatment and
education. Echo was assisted
NMCD with providing care for
those with hepatitis C in our
facilities and began a process
for providing much needed HCV
education on how to prevent
infection in the inmate
population
result in fewer cases.
HDB treatment positively impacts
as both of uh Doctor Warren,
Doctor Thornton have talked
about. It positively impacts our
population by reducing their use
of medical services and results
in better overall health
outcomes for the population.
In prison facilities, the peer
support workshops that are held
regularly with the inmates.
Allow for conversations about
hepatitis C treatment and
prevention. Relapse prevention,
substance addiction, a financial
planning, re-entry services,
among others that guide the
population and allow a safe
space for our population to
speak about difficult topics.
The peer educators in prison.
Also benefit from ECO in a huge
way by learning leadership
skills, public speaking skills,
and ultimately result in an
increase in their own
self-confidence. Oftentimes
people who've participated in
ECO as a, an inmate peer
educator has been released into
community to work with Echo
again in our community peer
program.
In community as part of our
community peer education
project. Peers have been hired
as Doctor Thornton said, by
Project Echo, um, and these are
people who've been inmates in
our prison system, people who
have served time on supervision
under probation and parole in
our communities.
This has given our peer
educators a distinct advantage
to know firsthand the struggles
and the barriers that our
population has and allows them
to provide guidance and support
in overcoming the challenges
faced by our clients.
Echo's peers provide resources
and peer support services to
those recently released from
incarceration in our
communities. They walk alongside
probation parole clients and
assist them with things like
employment, housing, health
care, treatment services.
They also provide resource
stations that occur at a number
of probation and parole offices
out around New Mexico, where
they provide a friendly face and
assistance with connecting our
population to much-needed
services.
The peer educators and community
are also holding biweekly
virtual peer support sessions
where clients across the state
can learn about topics in their
own time, uh, dealing with
employment, setting boundaries
and relationships recovering
from grief and managing and
succeeding on probation and
parole supervision.
A positive outcome that we did
not necessarily anticipate from
our partnership with Project
Echo, especially in the New
Mexico peer education program in
prison and the community peer
education project in the
community has been that Project
Echo itself has become a
vocational track for our
population.
Many educators have gained
full-time employment with Echo
through community peer project.
These peers are now working on
building the program and
facility and in community and
collaborating with NMCD on
creating and changing, uh,
programming to meet the active
current needs of the population.
A number of our echo peers have
also gone on to become certified
peer support workers through the
Office of Peer Recovery and
Engagement, and many of them
have found employment at
behavioral health providers and
community programs across the
state of New Mexico.
As the use of peer services
continues to expand. NCD
envisions that many more people
are going to be exiting our
system, finding meaningful
employment in this field.
Project Echo has been a really
valuable partner and resource to
NMCD over the last 20 years,
providing services to our
population that has had a
positive impact across New
Mexico in improving health care
outcomes for our clients through
their peer support services,
they have assisted inmates and
clients on supervision by having
a peer walk hand in hand with
them through their time with the
Department of Corrections.
In the criminal justice system,
and I think in life in general.
Change cannot be forced on
anybody. Change is the choice of
each individual person, the
choice to choose to be sober,
the choice to take better care
of one's health, uh, the choice
to stop committing crime.
These choices have to be made by
each person individually every
single day. But it sure is
easier, I think, to make better
choices. When a peer is walking
with you, providing
encouragement and support along
your journey and setting an
example that change can happen
in the lives of our population
can improve and that has been
what peer support services have
done for the corrections
department and for the vast
population that it has served
over the last few years.
I appreciate being here in
support of Project Echo and the
amazing work that they do across
the state of New Mexico. Thank
you all.
Mr. Chairman, members of the
committee, I will wrap up so we
have enough time for discussion
here.
A question I'm often asked is,
Does Echo actually work and
produce outcomes for our
patients and I'll just go
directly to slide 56 now.
And I would
There's a person here, Senator
Senator
Martin Hickey, who used to be
the CEO of our health system.
He knows how difficult it is to
change physician behavior.
And have them adopt best
practices. This is a struggle,
been a struggle for a very long
time.
I just want to point out, in
addition to the 273 publications
we have producing joy of work.
We have 168 peer reviewed
publications that when a doctor
participates in echo.
Their practice changes
fundamentally forever. This is
data that has come out from the
US Department of Defense from
the VA, from rural federally
qualified health centers when
you are mentored to implement
for diabetes or addiction.
It transforms your practice.
And echo is the only model where
the health of the community can
improve. Community viral loads
go down for HIV.
Community hemoglobin A1C levels
go down.
And it is very highly cost
effective to put our echo
intervention in perspective.
The state of New Mexico spends
more than $20 billion on
healthcare.
We have little more than 2
million people per capita cost
of healthcare is more than
$10,000. That's $200 billion are
being spent. We believe that the
small investment we make an echo
to upskill our workforce from
community health workers to
nurses to doctors to
specialists.
It is a tremendous return on the
investment.
For our state. And I'm grateful
for that. I will we now have the
last slide I want to talk about
with you is the benefits of the
eco model in healthcare for the
sake of time I'll skip my.
Presentation on education and
school teachers since this is
the health committee, but we
have demonstrated we can improve
quality and safety. This is
slide number 657. We can do
rapid learning. We can reduce
variation in care. We can
improve access for rural and
underserved patients. We can do
workforce training, improve
professional satisfaction.
Cost effective care, just the
Medicaid savings to prevent
travel of Medicaid, which
Medicaid pays for when you spend
somebody 200 miles each way is
massive.
is massive to prevent prisoners
from being transported again,
massive, and we integrate public
health.
I, I'm going to stop here and
open this up for discussion and
questions and, um.
If Mr. Chairman, if you allow,
I'd like to invite my colleagues
to the table here. Can you pull
up one more chair?
Yeah, let's pull up a chair.
Yeah, but.
Members of the committee, um,
we're gonna start with
Representative Chasey and we'll
just move right around and give
everybody a chance to ask how
many, uh, seconds are we giving
each person?
2120 seconds of 180 seconds for
each person or until the
Vice Chairman blows her whistle.
So Representative Chasey, we'll
start with you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank
you for your comprehensive
presentation today.
Um, you said that there were
260,000 trainees, was that over
what time, time frame do you
have that, those are the, those
who've been trained. Is that
correct?
Mr. Chairman, representative JC
um.
Thank you also for being for
being my representative, um, I
think that perhaps I misspoke,
um, the total number of unique
healthcare providers that have
been trained is 22,000.
These are healthcare providers,
not all doctors, they're nurses,
community health workers,
medical assistants, nurse
practitioners, pharmacists,
physician assistants. They have
attended.
287,000 sessions. So on average
each individual on average some
have attended 30, some 5, have
attended about 14 times each.
That's what I was trying to
imply.
And, and during, um, Mr.
Chairman, what time frame since
what, about 12 years, 12 years.
Thank you. One quick question,
um, for, uh, the deputy
secretary of Corrections, have
you done any follow-up with
formerly incarcerated
individuals to see if they can
sustain what they gained with
their health outcomes.
We definitely have, and I know
Project Echo is currently
working on a study, uh, of the
outcomes of this population, we
have had multiple people
contacted afterwards, uh, by ECO
to ensure that they are
continuing services and
healthcare, uh, and also we
follow up every, uh, quarter
with recidivism data to see if
people are returning into
custody if they did participate
in the program and so we're able
to see all of that information.
Thank you very much, Mr.
Chairman. I just want to suggest
that what we're trying to do
with regard to community safety
is
Based decisions on science.
The more information we have,
the better we can support those
kinds of um
Interventions and uh I, I, I
always think that corrections
needs to be a part of our
discussion of community safety.
Any package on improving
community safety that leaves
them out is um really missing a
giant chunk. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman.
Thank you, Representative
Senator Hickey.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and
colleagues, and I've got my
timer on because I could go for
15 minutes on this one.
So I'm, I'm well, it, it's just,
yeah, I've got it here. The, um,
uh the, the importance of this,
I mean, I think you know it, but
we dig deep down the disease
burden in this state is
overwhelming as it is, um, it's
being compounded by the
Practitioners leaving the
shortage of them and the other
thing it's gonna be just really
a killer for us is some of us
sitting around at this table who
are at the head of the baby
boom, and our chronic disease is
too bad, it's the way it is.
It's 70 and so forth, it just
gets worse. And the size of that
elephant going through the snake
is gonna kill the system. If we
didn't have programs like this
to decrease the demand by the
intervention.
The peer review, we would be in
even worse shape than we're
going to be in. I mean, it's
just, so I want everyone to take
a deep breath and, and, and this
is really the point I want to
make, um, uh, one is that LDL,
uh, should be below 50 for
everyone who has a positive
calcium score. That's what the
data is now. I'll come back to
that if I have time in another
place. But here's the key point
I want to make, um.
Project Echo will submit a
budget through the university.
The university will look at all
the needs and demands and so
forth and you know, a lot of
it's going to be influenced by
different appropriate things,
but
I bet that Project Echo because
it's been favored and this is
Martin's impression, OK, this is
Martin's impression because it's
been favored. It's gonna move
down the list because other
things have been waiting and you
know, who knows about the
priority, but here's the key
feature for us as legislators
when we see that budget come in
and when it goes into
appropriations into finance and
when they finally put it
together we need to be.
Advocating for, and I'm just
going to pick a number, but it's
probably not far off. 15 to 20%
more than what's being asked
for, because I think being asked
for is is status quo and, but
look at what they can do. And I
have a project for them in
calcium scanning and eliminating
heart disease, which is
possible, uh, with treatment of
LDLs above 50 to literally wipe
out heart attacks. Literally we
have that power today.
We, it's 50 cents a day in pills
for the people at risk, so, um,
just keep that in mind. We need
to raise his budget. He won't be
able to defend it, but we need
to do it. Thank you.
Mr. Chairman, members of the
committees, and of course
Senator Hickie, thank you for
your kind words. I, we would be
honored to do that project. We
are all convinced that lowering
LDL cholesterols.
Um, can completely prevent heart
attacks and certainly it would
be an honor to do that project.
And as you correctly pointed
out, we have been in the past
years been favored by this
committee, and you've helped us
so much, as I said earlier, but
um this year we are not a UNM
priority for any extra funding,
so I wanted to make that clear.
Certainly the legislature has
the option to do what they want
to, but I
Do not have the option to come
here and say, give me more
money, but certainly we do want
to be renewed for our recurring
appropriation and thank you for
your, for your comments,
Senator. You can blame it on me,
the Stokes and all the others.
It's OK. I'm happy to go toe to
toe with them.
Representative Kate, thank you,
Chair, and thank you, uh,
Senator Doctor Hickey, uh, what
a, a, a great moment of
energizing this conversation.
Um, uh, so it just to to
clarify, are some of the
individuals, the medical
providers going through this, or
some being able to achieve
uh um continuing education
credit through this program?
Mr. Chairman,
and representative Kathleen
Gates, um,
Every one of them for every hour
they join Echo, get a no cost
continuing medical education
credit. Normally they would need
50 every couple of years and we
provided them for free, and we
have provided tens of thousands
of
A continuing medical education
hours, hundreds of thousands
over the years, but even last
year we provided many, many
thousands.
Thank you for your question. So
thank you. So I have, uh, so I
know that UNM is, um, is looking
for a large appropriation to be
able to double the size and
upgrade their medical school.
Um, I hope that, um, they take
this opportunity to be able to
integrate uh this program into,
um, to, to be able to express
their new students and invest
the residency, the benefits of
being able to.
Um, provide this kind of service
and thank you and, and, and
thank you. I, I've had the
privilege of being able to uh
provide employment and, uh,
addiction services for
individuals and corrections and
it's a very satisfying work and
I can see that, um, that you are
mission driven, so thank you for
your work.
Representative Vincent.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I do
really appreciate that, uh,
especially the Indo side of
things and it made me feel so
much better about not having
that shortcake after lunch
today. I'm glad I I stayed away
from there.
Um, but what I, what I did hear
you say, doctor, is.
There's physicians that don't
really want, I mean, they don't
want to specialize in certain
things because they don't feel
as comfortable and they don't
want to put their medical
license. So this program here
with a peer to peer, it's making
them feel more confident in
In practicing specialized
medicine, correct?
Mr. Chairman and Representative
Vincent, that is exactly
correct, and that the, the
challenge that the people of New
Mexico feel is that the number
of specialists that exist at the
university or Presbyterian
system are so few.
That Medicaid patients and don't
have any access so they
essentially get into bad
outcomes, for example, what
Senator Hickey was talking
about.
If you don't treat.
And prevent the heart attack.
Which is what um
what Dr. Ban Will's work does,
right, prevent heart attacks.
Then when they get a heart
attack, they come into your
coronary care unit.
And in one shot, they could
easily consume 180 90 $100,000
right there and then in addition
to, they may get heart failure
after that, which means they
can't work anymore. So the
economic loss is huge, so this
lack of specialty access for our
underserved patients.
Is an extraordinary burden.
On our economy, it's an
extraordinary burden on the
quality of life of the citizens,
and it's an extraordinary burden
on healthcare costs, so stepping
in to provide the right care in
a preventative way.
is a game changer.
But I think what Senator Hickey
was talking about there are some
things every one of us in this
room needs to do, not just the
patients who are in rural New
Mexico, so there's a lot there.
Thank you for your question.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank
you for that answer. The other
thing that was alarming is the
uh the syphilis. I, I mean, I
guess we'd even call it an
epidemic since it's on the rise,
and if I know that there's a
prevention measure, but if
untreated, is it just continue
to get passed around or what was
the end result for a patient
that doesn't get treated for
that, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Mr.
Chair, and Representative
Vincent, thank you very much for
the question.
It is an epidemic in the country
and certainly in New Mexico and
if someone goes untreated, they
will continue to pass it on to
others. Um, sexually transmitted
infection. So it, it, it goes,
uh, people have to be treated to
stop the transmission of the, of
the disease.
And just real quick, uh, so I
did, she just didn't answer my
question. You got it good. What,
what happens to the individual
if they left untreated? Does it
cause, uh, physiological
problems. It causes a lot of
problems. So if someone remains
untreated from syphilis, they
can go on to develop sort of the
late stages of syphilis, which
are very, very severe. You can
and you can get neurosyphilis
and basically can cause
dementia. It can cause all sorts
of things. You can die from it,
um, you
It is incredibly debilitating
if, if left untreated over a
lifetime.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Representative
Representative Herndon.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank
you presenters. My question to
you, um,
Doctor, is there, have you put
together a budget of the
additional amount of money that
you would like to have and then
what it would be used for. Are
you prevented from doing that?
So Mr. Chairman, Representative
Huon um.
Let me answer this question in
this way.
We believe
Through workforce training.
We can do a lot more for the
citizens of this country, and
there is a lot of room for us to
do a lot more, for example, what
Representative Chasey was
talking about is one of our
dreams to prevent recidivism.
But to do that, of course we
started one small program,
community peer education program
and currently we employ 10 of
these prisoners who come out,
but there's room for more we can
do there. Secondary, what we
would like to use Echo.
is for educating prisoners
within the prison system. We
have all the technology
equipped. Every prison is
equipped. We have the best
teachers, because if we equip
them fully in the prison when
they come out, they have greater
opportunities because if we
cannot integrate them into
society, then you're going to
have crime. So that's one
example. And that area we really
want to workresentative Hendon
is education.
to mentor every school teacher
to be a better teacher so that
every rural gets a good
education. OK, now they only
give me 3 minutes. So did you
put together a budget and I'm
not allowed to do that this year
because of the fact that we are
not a UNM priority and we want
to be good corporate citizens.
And so we can't do that. OK. And
my next question, Mr. Chair,
and, and Doctor is with respect
to uh the services that are
being given in the prison, how
often it is occurring? How long
do they have to wait to receive
services through the ECO
program.
Mr. Chair, and Representative
Herndon, are you talking about
the the on the outside of the
prison or on the inside? On the
inside of the prison, and I'm
asking that only because I often
get contacted by people in the
prison and how long they're
waiting, and I'm just wondering
is with this echo, with the echo
program make a difference and
the services that they need to
be receiving and you're talking
about hepatitis C treatment in
particular? Not necessarily. OK.
So, so, um,
What were you gonna say? Oh,
yeah, so I, I guess in terms of
waiting, in terms of the peer
education project that we run,
people are being educated all
the time and there's really no
way for that. It's their choice
to do that. In terms of
hepatitis C treatment is where,
where we, we've been working in
that area.
OK, only in the hepatitis C, the
hepatitis C area we would like
to work on a lot of other things
there, but right now the funding
is very limited, just hepatitis
C, but there is a tremendous
opportunity in my view to
provide good health care to
prisoners.
For diabetes for other types of
all types of diseases which we
can help with.
Because if you don't treat them
in the prison, they come out,
get Medicaid and consume huge
amounts of dollars outside and
even outside care is delayed.
So we would like to do more.
But our current budgets don't
allow that, yeah.
OK, thank you and thank you, Mr.
Chair.
Thank you, Representative.
Representative Johnson.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Madam Vice Chair and presenters.
I don't have a question, but I
just want to thank you for your
work and your presentation. I
represent McKinley County. I
live in Gallup, so I have seen
the uh firsthand, the peer to
peer work through, uh, RMCH's
behavioral health program.
And, um, I think it works, um,
I've seen it through the
substance abuse support program.
And, um, I think it's a way to
maybe grow our own.
Um, in the healthcare arena and,
um, the interest in the programs
and the professionals. So just
want to thank you and I look
forward to looking into all of
these other programs, I think,
um, somehow we should look into
housing first.
The holistic approach, um,
without a home, without a place,
you can't live. Thank you.
Uh, Representative Chavez.
Thank you Mr. Chair. Yes, thank
you for the presentation. I, I
do have some questions, um, and
really I'm looking at, at slide
51, um, the, um, correction
facilities where you provide,
um,
Substance abuse treatment.
Um, and my question is, a, well,
my first question is.
Yeah, that's what I meant. I'm
sorry, thank you. Um,
So the question, the question
that I have is once, I mean,
some of them are probably going.
Once they're sentenced to say a
penitentiary. So what happens if
they are on, you know, a
medication to treat their, their
substance abuse disorder. How
many of them, how are we
following them throughout the
correctional system.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and
Representative, right now, we
are currently in process the
Department of Corrections with
the Department of Health and the
Health Care Authority on having
that Medicaid-assisted treatment
MOUD transition occur and
Doctor Wen alsogannier, who is
our healthcare authority for the
Department of Correction, spoke
on that as well as the secretary
a couple of weeks ago, and that
process is moving along and so
when someone will transition
into our system.
That care will continue once
this process is in place. And it
will continue and currently what
happens is it will continue into
community when they exit
facility into community resource
provider services. So, so right
now it's not in place.
Yeah, what's the time frame for
getting it in place because my
understanding is that.
If they're on, on Medicaid
medication assisted treatment,
they're in a facility, a
correction, a county facility
they moved to a state facility,
then that treatment stops, is
that right?
Mr. Chair and Representative, I
can't speak to that specifically
today. I can get you more
information on that and connect
you with
once Kanee, um, to give you what
the timeline looks like. I
apologize for that. That would
be great. Thank you. My other
question um is related to
diabetes. You and your
presentation said that there are
Mr. Chair, many New Mexicans and
I forgot what she said in terms
of maybe 1 out of 3 or something
like that, don't know that
they're pre-diabetic.
And my understanding is that um
food sometimes has a lot to do
with whether or not you're
diabetic. So my question is,
what recommendations do you have
for the county facilities in
terms of improving the kind of
nutritious food that inmates get
on an everyday basis.
Mm
Mr. Chairman, Representative
Chavez, I think that's an
excellent question and I think
it's a tremendous opportunity.
I've, I've got several ideas and
I think that would be a great
space to explore, making a
difference.
Mr. Chair, can you give us a
couple of your thoughts?
Absolutely, may, may I have 3
minutes? No, I, I, a couple of
thoughts, uh, in some general
concepts would be a lower
carbohydrates, uh, types of uh
diets that keep whether you have
diabetes or not that keep
insulin levels low because
there's a tight relationship
between high insulin levels to
to try to compensate for
carbohydrate intake and heart
disease, blood vessel problems,
cancer risk.
All, all kinds of things, blood
pressure problems. Um, there,
there is also a lot of evidence
that diets that are, uh, not
necessarily have to be a
complete Mediterranean diet, but
adopt a lot of those very
important principles like uh
whole grain types of
carbohydrates, high in
vegetables and fruits, uh, are
also very beneficial from a
diabetes prevention standpoint
and heart disease prevention.
And Mr. Chairman, Representative
Chavez, I think both of your
questions are so insightful.
First of all, the reason our
success for hepatitis C in the
prisons was because it was a
collaboration between the
legislature and us at Echo.
The legislator provided the
money for the drugs for
hepatitis C.
Whereas we provided the
expertise to get it done.
If the legislator and the prison
department provides the
medicines.
In the prisons, it would be such
an honor for us to make sure
that world-class treatment for
addiction is provided in the
prisons.
Because addiction is such a
central unifying force.
For bringing failure to a human
being?
That addressing it up front in a
robust way in the prison, it's a
unique opportunity and we would
be so honored to collaborate if
there was such an opportunity
for doing that. And I, I, I'm
going to be a little bit more
blunt, but in general.
And the prison food has way too
much carbs in it.
And not enough um fruits and
vegetables and other things and
so that could be clearly a place
to improve too.
Representative Royal Caballero.
Thank you Mr. Chair, and, um,
thank you, doctor and your team,
everybody here, uh, as you've
heard before in previous
presentations this is close and
dear to my heart. Um, I'm a, uh,
huge fan of the University of
New Mexico health care system.
I'm a patient and I've just
been, uh, I, I can't ask for a
better care. And so as a result
of this, I wanted to raise a
couple of things. Page 5.
Your echo model and, and, and
the language that you've been
using throughout democratizing,
um, democratize is it, it means
opening up access and
opportunity and, and it has many
more meanings, but in this, this
is really important so that
continue that language because
it resonates and it creates a
mantra. And I think that's what
we need. The other thing you I
quoted you on is communities of
practice and mentoring our
school.
This is just incredibly
important because what we're
wanting to do is build uh these
collective mindsets and
communities, uh, the concept of
Communities because that eludes
means wholeness and, and a lot
of other things, but that.
That language is so incredibly
important, so don't stop using
it. I want to point out another
thing that I um was very uh
thrilled with his um page 6, I
guess it's 16 where you talked
about the software program for
feedback and assessment of
outcomes. That's incredibly
important for the work that we
do because it's important for us
to understand, uh, and, and I'd
hate to keep using financial
related terms but it is our.
return on investment because
that's what
The committees and budget and
appropriations all want to hear,
uh, but, but more importantly,
the return on investments, the
healthcare of our health and
well-being of our communities,
so finally I want to give a
little bit of personal testimony
and I think I have his
permission to do so. My husband
is a perfect example of, uh,
what you talked about in terms
of diabetes on page 22 and 29,
and then all the other charts,
um, we are.
Patient of the
Family care clinics, um, and
they've gone through this, um,
training and it began with our
primary care physician being
concerned about uncontrollable
high blood pressure of my
husband. At the same time that
she was trying to deal with
that, he became an oncology
patient.
Um, at the same time, uh, Mr.
Chair,
he went through a rigorous
nutritionist program, patient
education program, um, change of
meds, nothing was controlling
the high blood pressure, but
because there's this teamwork at
the at the hospital and
coordinated care that exists
there. He was then the, the
oncologist thought about
endocrinology.
Technology ended up.
Recommending making certain uh
Recommending making certain
recommendations that did not
prevent his heart attack. He was
already without us knowing on
the road to a major heart
attack. He had the major heart
attack while being treated well,
and then soon after for
oncology. My point being that
everything you described, I can
give, he can give lived
experience, testimony to the
effect and the outcomes. Look at
him today. He's a walking
example.
of what they've titled him at
the oncology and everybody at
UNMH, they call him the Iron
Man. So I just want to give that
personal testimony because it
exemplifies exactly what your
presentation was all about today
and I want to thank you for your
work and I'll continue to do
everything that I can to
continue to empower your work.
Thank you.
Thank you, Representative
Representative Jaramillo.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you
for your presentation.
So, um, a few years ago I
remember attending a Project
Echo Workshop. I'm a speech
language pathologist, so I, I
thank you for that, that
training. But it also occurred
to me, especially, um, for our
colleague who is on
appropriations that, um, you
touch on so many different areas
and I think it's important for
all of us to understand that. So
it's, it's not just physicians,
it's, it's not just corrections,
it's also education. Can you
just share with us all those
areas.
That you touch on so that when
we look at appropriations and
return on investment. We know
exactly how many areas we're
touching on.
Mr. Chairman, Representative
Heromeo, I think that the
biggest work that we have is in
healthcare, in prevention.
And treatment upskilling all
aspects of the healthcare
workforce we have talked about
doctors, nurse practitioners,
but the biggest workforce here
that we can deploy for our
community's good is community
health workers.
But they need mentorship. They
need certifications, so
Doctor Bung Bill has created a
diabetes certification program
for them. So we can upskill
workers to be patient education
in the opioid use space to the
opportunity exists to upskill
community health workers to be
patient support workers and
certify them. So there's the
whole healthcare field where we
have 65 different disease areas
we work on. But then,
Right now in the area of great
need for us is funding our
education work.
It's all funded.
By philanthropy pretty much.
And that won't last that long.
The reason is we believe.
That if we mentor school
teachers to become amazing. What
we've observed Representative
Herramillo, is that school
teachers go into the profession
for one reason and only one
reason to serve their
communities.
When we empower them, they can
be game changers. And we believe
that that can be a huge success
factor for the future economic
development of our state and the
future health of our state. It
can reduce.
One of the biggest problems we
have right now, for example, we
are working in schools to
diagnose anxiety and depression
earlier to prevent drug use.
One of my biggest desires is to
work on preventing teenage
suicide in this, in my
daughter's school.
In the last
4 years, 2 kids shot themselves
and successfully committed
suicide. And I, I think this is
a huge problem and so there's a
lot of work to be done. We are
interested in a lot of work in
schools from mentoring school
teachers, school leadership
training.
Early childhood education,
diagnosis of early childhood
trauma, but also math and
science are.
is really poor.
So, last year,
We had requested $6000.
Recurring appropriation for our
work in schools.
Right now, actually 3700 unique
teachers have participated. The
feedback that from teachers is
in the last 5-6 pages of this
report, I didn't get a chance to
cover it because
I know I didn't want to overrun
my time, but please, if you do
get a chance to look at that.
Now, this year, we were not able
to get that. Last year we were a
priority for 6 million, but it
didn't get funded.
This year, we are not a
priority but in our hearts we
still want to do this work if we
can, and that's all I can say
right here, but thank you for
your kind question. Thank you so
much and, and, um, when we are
50th in the nation in child
welfare, we need to invest, uh,
appropriately and consciously,
um, to move our, our state
forward. Thank you so much.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Senator Cero Lopez, thank you,
Mr. Chair and thank you all for
your incredible work. I was
thinking about how your original
inspiration was somebody in a
rural community who needed help
and wasn't able to get it. And,
um, I know that's one of the
reasons we ended up passing the
telehealth Health Act and really
trying to expand that. But one
of the issues we've seen is a
medical board, um,
has, what, what is described as
the strictest rules in the
country about allowing somebody
who's licensed.
Elsewhere about not allowing
them to practice through
telehealth in, um,
In New Mexico, so I was
wondering if you've run into
that problem or is this relevant
to your work at all? Um, because
I'm really concerned about that.
Because the telehealth Health
Act was about expanding
resources for our people, not
contracting them.
Mr. Chairman, Representative
Servio Lopez.
It doesn't impact me directly
because what we do is upskilling
the workforce, and that is
allowed across state lines, etc.
what what our board that you're
talking about the restrictions
are on somebody not having a New
Mexico license treating and I.
I don't personally understand
all the reasons for that and
what the rationale is.
But my own bias is if there is a
possible way to
Losing those restrictions.
I also have another personal
bias, which I will tell you that
I think we should have a
national license for medicine.
That each state putting all
these resources, we should have
national databases for quality
of doctors. We should have
national databases for poor
performance. We should have
national databases for
competence, and we should all
recognize each other's.
and allow
Free trade across our borders.
That's my bias because
There is just too much.
Lack of access in this country.
And if you don't have the right
knowledge at the right place at
the right time?
It is impossible to get the
right care at the right place at
the right time. It is
impossible, and that is
happening millions of times
every day in this country.
And 6 billion people in the
world don't have it, so it's a
problem that requires a very
much more open way of thinking.
From a patient's perspective
instead of thinking from a
state's perspective or a
licensing perspective or really,
what does the patient want? and
I think if you think that way,
we may come to better solutions.
Absolutely we're at a minimum we
could agree to be part of a
compact.
Thank, thank you for getting it.
OK
Thank you for your incredible
work. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Senator. Senator
Pope.
I'm good. I'm gonna yield some
of my time.
OK.
Representative Ferrari, you get
some of his time.
Thank you, um, uh, thank you,
Doctor Aurora and your team, um,
as we are trying to um increase
the alcoholic sized tax to
reduce consumption and also
raise funds to have the aha
fund, um, projects such as what
you're doing, uh, with the one
alcohol use and mental health
echo program.
Um,
We could, um, send funds to that
or to Project Echo in general,
would that be useful?
Mr. Chairman, Representative
Ferrari, that would be very
useful.
Yes, and there is a huge problem
here that if you have somebody
who's drinking alcohol.
stopping requires help, often
alcohol can be a drug that
people are using to overcome
anxiety.
Sometimes there's underlying
depression that they are trying
to overcome.
And then.
I think that.
It's really important.
To think of people in a holistic
way.
What is the root cause of that
addiction, there is often mental
health issues related to them,
and we need to address these in
a holistic way. If we don't do
that.
And a lot of this work requires.
Multidisciplinary teams.
As was beautifully mentioned by
Representative Caballero is that
we can provide that because when
we start an echo.
And
Representative Ferrari, if you
get a chance to review the slide
of Dr. Bushan will, how many
specialists he has for complex
diabetes patients. And so we
bring that, we bring a
psychiatrist, we bring addiction
experts. We bring counselors all
to opine and help these doctors
develop the skill to manage
people with alcoholism instead
of just saying stop cold turkey
and then treating their other
mental health disorders. So yes,
this is a great opportunity for
New Mexico to upskill.
In this area and we would be
honored to.
Received support from you.
Thank you so much. Thank you,
Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Representative
Representative Thompson.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. And
we have an international rock
star in front of us. If, if you.
If you go to national
conferences when people learn
you're from New Mexico, they'll
say, you have Project Gecko.
It's like, yes, we do.
So, and Representative Miguel
Garcia has been saying for years
he deserves a Nobel Prize, and
I'm on that train with them. So
just, just, so years ago when
the behavioral health system was
destroyed, I got appointed to be
the, um,
Behavioral health subcommittee
chair, which was daunting in
that way, but also that the two
previous chairs had died in
office,
um, like, whoa, do I wanna take
this? But I did and uh we had
great plans and things didn't go
the way, um, but I was, I did
have the pleasure of working
with Doctor Miriam. I never
pronounced her name right.
OK.
And sat in on an echo on, um,
behavioral health and if you
have not done that, I mean, not
necessarily behavioral health,
pick your favorite and just sit
in. It is incredible what how,
how they do things, what you'll
learn, it really is
democratizing knowledge. So I
would encourage all of you to
make arrangements with the
Project Echo to sit in on, like
I said, one of the, one of the
projects that you're, that has
That interest to you, um.
And let's see, um, all righty.
uh,
and this is a little off
subject, but it kind of goes
right to what they do, so we
have we a few weeks ago there
was a news story about a drug
smuggling ring in the Santa Fe
jail.
And you know, that's all well
and good, but to find out that
the majority of drugs that were
being smuggled in.
We medication assisted
treatment. So we had someone in
our jail who wasn't able to get
medication-assisted treatment
and he was having drugs smuggled
in to help him stay clean and to
me that's a major lawsuit. I
mean, I, and I, I, we said it
over and over again. I'm so sick
of correction saying it's
coming. Oh, we got one person
that is not acceptable on a
financial level, on a
humanitarian.
level on a legal responsibility
level, so we, I, I'm just, I'm a
big fan of Project Echo and
Doctor.
Doctor, Doctor, I can't remember
how to pronounce his name, um.
And Guindanos, he just left, but
when, when he was presenting to
us earlier I thought Project
Echo, we need to connect him
with Project and he had a
meeting, so he had to leave, but
I promised I would connect you,
um, so Project Echo can do.
Anything for our state really. I
mean, if we give them a, give
them a mission, they're gonna
figure out a way to do it and
I'm so proud that you're from
New Mexico and when, when you're
out at health care things, just
brag up project say Project Echo
and everybody would be like, oh
you have that. So thank you,
thank you all for your great
work.
Thank you, Representative
Thompson.
uh, my first question has to do
with the community.
Per educators.
And just glancing at it, it
looks like they're all women.
Do you have any male community
peer educators, thank you for
that very important question.
We, we had one who was just
hired by the Echo, um, the
starting up in the peer
education project starting in
Colorado, they hired him. It has
been very difficult for us to
recruit male peer educated
outside the inside the prison,
you know, they, a lot of, most
of them are male, but outside
the prison, it's been really
difficult to, to, to recruit
them and you may have some
insight into this as well, but
Definitely, Mr. Chair, and we,
we have had a number of them
over the course of the project,
which has gone on for a number
of years, but they've left to do
other things. Just in general
services for healthcare and
services like peer support, you
do find a much higher percentage
of women who work in those
industries. We are looking at
trying to recruit more men
because we desperately need
them, uh, around the state
because they can message to men
in a way that potentially the
women cannot. And we want to
make sure we're covering all of
our bases.
we will definitely look at and
try to recruit. I, I, I'm sorry,
I would say one other thing that
was, um, the leader, Carissa
McGee, who runs that program,
told me that the men are, they
can get much better paying jobs
very easily in construction and
things like that where they,
where the women are, are more
likely to not be able to get
those jobs, so that, that's one
of the reasons. It's not the
only reason I think, but it's
definitely one of the reasons.
So when they're hired, I mean.
Who hires them? Does the
Department of Corrections hire
them or the the uh
uh project Echo stuff so and so
they're on your step and, and.
And are the salaries competitive
or
Obviously not with construction
if people are going to, but not
everybody wants to work in
construction, I can't, I don't
know if you can answer that
question Mr. Chair, I can speak
to that. They are competitive to
what peer support work is being
paid around the state. And do I
believe that that amount is too
low across the board? Yes.
Um
Is the Department of Corrections
of sending staff to the, uh,
Project Echo medication assisted
treatment, uh.
Online sessions that the that
the jail staffs are attending?
Mr. Chair, I, I can't speak to
who has attended. I have not
attended one, but we do attend
echo sessions often and I would
not be surprised if we are
currently attending that
session. I will find out and let
you know because we
we're hoping that this year the
department will implement.
May Mayville or whatever the
drug is for Hep C that you
utilize.
Maveet Mave that that is even
though it's incredibly cheaper
than it used to be the drug that
we used used to be that it's
still one of the most expensive
of the of the drugs. Is there a
way that's going to come down or
is that looking likely to come
down are there ways we can push
it down. That's a great
question, Mr. Chair.
Um, it is, it's much less
expensive than when it came out
that when, when, when the fir
when these hepatitis C
medications came out, they were
the most expensive medicines per
pill ever to be released on the
market. And they have come down
by about two-thirds, but they're
still very expensive. One of the
ways that we are getting a
cheaper, well, in the, in the
corrections department is
getting a little bit of a
cheaper rate is because they,
um,
Uh, they partnered with the
Department of Health and get,
getting 340B pricing for those
medications, but they're still
expensive even with 340B
pricing. So, to my knowledge,
there's no
You know, in the, in the near
future, I don't know that those
medications will become less
expensive, and they certainly
aren't going to come, become
generic for a while.
Doctor, Mr. Chairman.
What has happened is these drugs
came out at $90,000 per cure for
patient.
Currently for the average person
outside in the community, it's
$20,000 for our corrections
patients, we're getting it for
about $10,000 for a cure. It is
a very high upfront cost, but
the downstream saving is very,
very substantial in the sense
that when economists have looked
at it, they find that this is
one of the highest return on
investments to cure hepatitis C
patient, you prevent future ICU
admissions, etc.
There is a move in this country
right now to have a national
hepatitis C elimination project.
Because in this country we have
millions of people with it who
don't have access to treatment.
There are countries, um,
and actually one state in the
United States which is
Louisiana, that actually signed
a blanket agreement. So in
Australia did the same for one
time fee to the pharmaceutical
companies. They have the drug
free for their whole population
and there they can do amazing
things.
In our
In our country, we do have a
plan for that, and that plan has
been is a White House plan, but
it has had a hard time gaining
traction.
In Congress for for reasons that
I think you can understand
better. I think it's hard to do
something bipartisan right now,
but this has bipartisan support
right now, and that's where it
is and I want to also take this
opportunity to thank you once
again, Mr. Chair and Vice Chair.
That for giving us this
opportunity to share our work,
I'm going to leave my cards here
on this table, if any of you are
interested, if there's any way
we can be of help to you, please
reach out to us or if any
questions come out later and
thank you again for all your
support.
Well, thank you, not just for
the presentation, which has been
fascinating and very
informative, very helpful, but
for the work obviously that you
all do during the year to help
New Mexicans. So thank you all
doctors and, and, uh,
corrections department officials
for coming and sharing with us.
We really appreciate it and, uh,
we do wish that was a priority
this year, but we'll, we'll keep
working on it.
Thank you all. So now before we
go to the next presentation, I
would like to get action on our
minutes. We have a quorum where
we had one for a while. I think
we're OK.
Um, did everybody have a chance
to look at the minute? They were
included in our packages.
Do we have a motion
Senator Cedilo Lopez moves the
adoption of the minutes.
Seconded by Representative
Ferrari. Is there any opposition
to adopting the minutes as they
were presented to us.
Yes, question.
Use your microphone and could we
keep the conversation down.
In the minutes you have uh
people who were present and
those who were absent. But
sometimes people have a good
reason when they couldn't, is
there a difference between being
absent and excused?
No, you're you're not here,
you're not here. And it's just
for, and you had, you had car
trouble, we know,
but not a problem. You, you will
still get your perfect
attendance medal at the end of
the year.
So,
so, OK, I just, I was busy.
So seeing no objection to the
minutes other than a plaintive
plea for, for mercy, uh, we'll
consider the minister have been
adopted.
And we'll move to our next
presentation which is on SNAP
benefits.
And we have with us, uh, Cody
Jeff.
The public benefits attorney for
the Center on Law and Poverty.
And Shannon Hudson, the SNAP and
public benefits outreach manager
of the Road Runner Food Bank.
Could you please come up
And give us your best shot.
We could, we could hold the
conversation to a minimum so we
can go on with the, with the
plan.
The program.
Well, we have 3 panelist.
I'll let you introduce yourself
then.
Please go ahead.
Good afternoon, Mr. Chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Cody Jeff, and I am an
attorney at the New Mexico
Center on Law and Poverty. I'm
joined today by Jason Riggs and
Shannon Hudson with the
Roadrunner Food Bank.
Today, um, I want to start off
by kind of going over the
handouts I passed out for you
today. So the first handout, I'm
holding above my head is a blue
handout. So this is the
presentation. It's uh numbered
at the bottom right. So I'll be
going through this presentation
today, as well as my colleagues
here and the second handout I
have as well that you should
have received and I have a bunch
of copies if you need it. Is
this one page fact sheet. So
this one page fact sheet, uh,
really summarizes what will be
going.
Over today and really, you know,
putting into um something
digestible.
So, um, I'm gonna start off,
then I'm gonna pass it to my
colleagues uh halfway through
the presentation so they could
do their part and talk about the
wonderful work that Road Runner
Food Bank does. So the New
Mexico Center of Law and Poverty
is a nonprofit, um, uh, advocacy
organization. I work primarily
focuses around low-income
communities focusing on
economic, uh, justice.
And on the 3rd slide, on page 3
of the slides, as you may know,
the supplemental nutrition
assistance program, formerly
known as SNAP, or formerly known
as food stamps or snap for
short, is a program that
provides federally funded
benefits for states to
administer.
And this, these benefits are
really important because they
provide New Mexican families
with um with benefits who but
one living in Mexico and meet
the income requirements.
Importantly about SNAP is that
the federal government pays the
full cost of SNAP benefits, and
that, that go to families. And
then the federal government
splits the cost of administering
those benefits with states.
Now, uh, page 4, we can see how
important these benefits are to
the Mexican families because.
Uh, the most recent report and
the Healthcare Authority put out
in June 2024, is that Snap feeds
170,000 New Mexican children and
300,000 New Mexican adults and
those are really big numbers and
going on to the next uh uh page
on page 5, we can really look at
who's getting those benefits and
what types of households, you
know, are getting these. And
majority of these households are
families with
Children
And you can see there's over 67%
of the households are those. And
then the other households
significant numbers are those
households have older adults or
adults, individuals with
disabilities in their households
that are getting these benefits.
And the other point I want to
make about who's getting these
benefits is those, uh those
households that receive SNAP,
those households are more likely
to be working. And on page 6 as
we move towards it, we can see
uh a little bit more
understanding of why that is.
Because if a family receives
SNAP, that means that they're
using their SNAP benefits to pay
for food and use that money they
would have otherwise spent on
food, on other necessities such
as childcare, uh, reliable
transportation, cell phone
services that help them maintain
and keep a job.
And as we move forward on page
7, we can see that despite how
successful Snap is, New Mexico
continues to face food
insecurity with 1 in 5 children
not getting enough food to eat.
Now you may be asking
yourselves, is Snap the only
solution to food insecurity? No,
it's not.
But it's the probably the most
effective tool we have in making
sure that um families have
enough to eat and how we do that
is making sure that all, as many
eligible New Mexicans who are
eligible for SNAP are enrolling,
especially families with
children, and on page 8, we can
see why it's so important.
To make sure that you know these
families with children are
getting snapped or getting
enrolled is because Snap has
such a profound impact on a
child's educational and economic
uh growth and potential. We know
that there's higher uh
educational rates such as uh
higher graduation rates in high
school, a higher work rate, we
just talked about that. And
women become much more
self-sufficient on Snap as well.
So we know that these benefits
are.
Really important to families.
And as we move to 9 page 9, we
can see that, well, well, what
challenges are out there to
making sure that New Mexicans
are enrolled. We know that as a,
as New Mexico, where a rural
state, we have many rural
communities out there. We have
many New Mexicans, English is
not their first language and
those communities face uh
barriers to making sure that
they get interpretation and
translation services as well.
We have people with
disabilities, they may not have
the the means to have
transportation to go to a local
ISC office to talk in person or
even to talk on the phone. They,
they may require other their
family members to be able to
help them with their um
application process. And we also
know that people who are age 50
over are not enrolling in SNAP.
And we also, uh, the last thing
I want to touch on is literacy
barrier as well. And what that
means is that in New Mexico,
even if everything is translated
and it's uh interpreted, that
doesn't mean that everyone's
gonna understand it at at what
is being presented. Everyone has
in New Mexico there's different
literacy levels on what they can
read and understand. So we have
to make sure that when we're
talking to these uh potential
applicants, we're educating them
on the process as well.
So going on to page 10.
Um
The healthcare authority has
done great number of strides
making sure that uh the
application process and checking
people's benefits, they can do
this online. They've done great
strides to do that. But that
also doesn't really, um,
That doesn't really benefit
everybody who lives in rural
places who may not have access
to internet, reliable service,
and we know a majority, a lot of
these communities too are tribal
communities. So we, even though
that there's this really push to
make sure that New Mexicans have
access to benefits, it's not
really helping every New Mexican
who may not have the means to,
uh, internet service.
So going on to page 11, we also
know, uh, uh, sitting out here
today in New Mexico, we know
that there's been a rising food
prices. Food prices, you know, a
bag of chips are going to like
$5 which is unprecedented. That
is still, it still blows me
away. And that's, and the food
prices uh in Mexico and the
nation is projected to increase
again this year in 2024 by 2.3%.
And how that affects families is
not just that they're having to
pay more at the grocery store.
But that also means that their
benefits aren't going as far.
And that's making families
having to go hungry and having
it making sacrifices at the
grocery store or forestalling
not paying other bills that they
need to pay.
In other challenges too, uh, can
affect, uh, when, when this, uh,
when families receive their
benefits, and one of that is uh
administrative challenge.
The healthcare authority uh, has
done a great number, a great
deal of work to make sure that
families get their benefits
timely, but still there are
always issues with uh there may
be issues related to staffing in
high volume of applications that
peak time of the year that can
overwhelm the healthcare
authority's ability to process
these applications and to make
sure that New Mexicans get their
benefits. So there's always that
um challenge that may, that
result in the Mexicans not
getting their benefits on time.
And uh going down to 12.
Um, you know, I just listed a
bunch of challenges that New
Mexicans face, but I wanted to
tell you some uh.
A story about Denise. Denise was
a client we had who came to the
New Mexico Center of Law in
poverty for help.
So Denise, Denise is a single
mother of three daughters.
A 3 year old, an 11 year old and
a 20 year old, and Denise only
speaks English.
Today's was like we find
ourselves in many situations
like all of us do and our points
and different points in our
lives. She was having trouble
finding work.
And she was having trouble
affording food, so she applied
for SNAP. And she did what,
everything she needed to do. She
did an interview, she submitted
all the required documents. And
this included proof of income,
her daughter's school
enrollment.
But then she applied and she
started getting confusing
notices that were only in
English.
You know, she only speaks
Spanish, so she was trying to
make sense of this and they told
her she was denied.
Because she failed to turn in
paperwork, she already turned
in.
So this was a very confusing
time for Denise. So she tried to
go in person to a local income
support division office where
you can go get help and they
told her her application, there
was no record of it.
Eventually, Denise was referred
to the New Mexico Center on Law
and Poverty, where we were able
to help her, but not before
Denise and her daughters had to
go without money and without uh
without enough money to buy
food, and they had to forego
paying other bills just to buy
food.
This story highlights the need
for enrollment in the community
where outreach workers could
have helped people like Denise
apply for benefits, tracker,
application.
And especially talk to a
language that she understands.
And so this is really, you know,
leading to what I want you all
to talk to you all about today
is um moving on to page 13.
Is the staff outreach program.
And this is a uh program through
the United States Department of
Agriculture.
So what is it? Moving on to page
14.
So we know, um, families such as
Denise face a lot of barriers
and the snap outreach is really
a federal program that allows
states to receive matching
federal funding to implement a
snap outreach program.
And moving on to page 15.
So what does that mean? Well,
the federal match is a 1 to 1 to
1 match, meaning the federal
government will match state and
community organization
donations.
We're on page 16. So why, you
know, how does it work though?
Well, it really allows the Snap
Outreach plan it really allows
um states to prioritize groups
with low participation rates and
I listed a few there, so you can
imagine how, you know, this
program really would allow us to
meet people like Denise or if
Denise had been living in a
rural community to meet her
where she's at, and not having
to um uh lead Denise out in the
rain.
And moving on to page 17.
We also know that the Snap
outreach program could really
benefit New Mexico in general
too. As I, as I just talked
about earlier at the Healthcare
Authority, there can be high
volumes of application periods
and um staffing shortages that
could cause delays in New
Mexico's uh administering
benefits to the Mexicans. How
this program could work for the
healthcare authority too is
alleviating some of that
pressure by
Allowing uh New Mexicans to
enroll in places like Road
Runner.
And then to help them
applicants, potential applicants
apply for SNAP there, that would
take off some of the pressure
that the healthcare authority
faces during some times of
periods of the year, so that the
Mexicans like Denise.
In other uh applicants don't
have to go hungry. They don't,
they don't have to.
Um, forego paying other bills.
And we also know why it's good
for New Mexico, is that a
higher, the more people we
enroll is good is because every
dollar spent, every stamp dollar
spent in Mexico produces $1.50
in local, local economic
activity, and that's really
generating millions for New
Mexico.
So this is really good for New
Mexico in general. Move on to
slide 18.
So what really what really the
program does is that we're
through this uh snap outreach
program, uh, community
organizations such as RoadRunner
are able to educate the public.
And that really helps them know
what, what is Snap and what Snap
doesn't do.
They, it can help families uh
help, uh, community
organizations like Road Learner,
pre-screened families to know if
they're eligible.
And if, once the program is
robust enough, it'll allow
community organizations to
follow up and be a touchstone.
For families after they submit
their application. And so you
can imagine how this could have
benefited Denise after she
submitted her application and
submitted into the ether.
Um, moving on to page 19.
It can really help develop um
Uh, a good working coordination
between community organizations
like food banks in Mexico, Road
Runner, and other in the state,
um, the healthcare authority to
to help identify uh enrollment
strategies, and enrollment
barriers that can help the
Mexicans in general.
Um, moving on to 20 page 20. We
also know that
Our other neighboring states
such as Colorado, um, Nebraska,
Texas, New Jersey have already
implemented these plans. They
have already have a robust
programs that allow them to um
educate there, offer trainings,
technical assistance and funding
other community organizations.
On slide 21.
So where are we at in New Mexico
in 2023, New Mexico submitted
its first Snap outreach plan.
And so we're thrilled that uh
the health care, their
healthcare authority worked with
Roadrunner to submit this plan
in 20 October 2023. And this
resulted in New Mexico drawing
down $60,000 to match 60, the
$60,000 that Road Runner Food
Bank invested.
And these funds were helped uh
really uh helped to
Uh, expand and help Roadrunners
already existing Snap Outreach
plan program.
So moving on to slide 22.
Um, so,
What are we really asking for
today? The first piece is really
a legislation. There's
significant opportunity in
Mexico to take action in the
next legislative session to
institutionalize a snap outreach
plan.
Put in the plan into statute
would require the health care
authority to submit a plan each
year to the USDA. This will
allow the network of SNAP
community enrollers like, like
Road Runner to continue to grow
and expand over the years
because we had just submitted
our first one in 2023.
On slide 23,
This is the second component is
an investment for an effective
implementation of the program.
So that um this model investment
would be, we're asking for
$150,000.
And this could dramatically
strengthen the snap outreach
program in New Mexico.
And we listed what that, uh,
investment would be used for as
well on slide 23 and the bullet
points. One, it'd be used for a
dedicated staff member to
oversee and manage the Snap
outreach program in New Mexico.
An application portal uh that
will allow snap outreach workers
to have read-only access, so
they'd be able to uh track, for
example, uh Denise's application
and where it's it is at and uh
being approved.
Um, also interpretation services
for outreach workers.
And that would really have
helped um Denise uh if she were
to go to a um a community
organization like Road Runner
should be able to get the
interpretation services that she
would, she needs. And
And the last piece is these are
these small grants.
And the small grants are really
important for community
organizations because those
community organizations might
not be able to have their own
funds to put up like R Road
Runner did last year. So that,
that would be the last piece of
it to provide them with uh those
smaller organizations with it.
So right now I'm gonna turn it
over to Roadrunner so they can
tell them about their wonderful
fabulous work that they do.
Thank you,
thank you, Chairman Ortizipino,
and thank you everyone, uh,
that's uh been a pretty exciting
afternoon. Uh, my name is Jason
Riggs. I am the director of
advocacy and public policy at
Roadrunner Food Bank, uh, next
year will make my uh 16th year
at the food bank.
Um,
Roadrunner is the largest food
bank in New Mexico, uh, one of,
uh, there are 4 others, uh, we
distribute a lot of food to
those other 4 food banks where
the sole member of Feeding
America, in case anyone doesn't
know Feeding America is a
nationwide network of food
banks.
Um, some stats in the handout on
slide 25, uh, but directing your
attention in 2013, uh, Road
Runner Food Bank received a
grant to begin snap outreach and
um.
Fortunately for me, that was my
job was to start the snap
outreach program.
one of you, could you turn off
your mic?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Uh, 2013 we received a grant
from Feeding America to start a
snap outreach program and, uh,
as I began speaking with
colleagues in other states,
their states had a state snap
outreach plan and we're drawing
down matching funds from the
federal government. New Mexico
hadn't had one, so.
Better part of 10 years I've
been tormenting anyone I can to
talk about getting this state
snap outreach plan and thanks to
some great progress from the
healthcare authority and Mr.
Kosky, uh, sitting in the back
there, a lot of progress has
been made in the last year, uh,
Simply put, uh, and this is per
Feeding America's very extensive
research. Snap can provide 9
times the amount of meals as the
entire nationwide food bank
system.
Uh, food banks were designed to
be emergency services and SNAP
is really the first line of
defense against extreme hunger
in the United States, um.
In my 16 years I've been witness
to history twice during the
recession and then of course
during the pandemic, on both
occasions, snap allotments were
increased and it became easier
to get on and stay on Snap and
made a huge difference during
those times of national crisis,
uh, going over to pay slide, uh,
let's see here.
26 it's a tier right.
No, uh, we had our own uh
program in 2013 that we started.
Yeah, yeah, exactly, so, uh,
SNAP programs at food banks,
there's not a lot of grand
opportunities for them. There's
not a lot of funding for them.
Uh, we can show pictures of big
trucks and beautiful pallets of
food which is necessary. Uh, but
it's really hard to paint a
picture on what Snap does and
what app helping someone apply
for it does. So we yeah, we
existed for uh up until last
year.
Uh, and that's when the state
submitted a, uh, a snap outreach
program. So this was the 2023
fiscal year 23 was the first
time that the food bank was
actually receiving funding, uh,
from the state government via
federal matching grants. OK, so
you started a program on your
own in 2013. Yes sir. Then you
started getting this money
matched with federal money in
2023. OK, correct, correct,
yeah, and it was, uh, yeah, and
one of the hardest parts of
those 1st 10 years was just
having
enough,
you know, having enough capacity
to help as many people as we
can. Um, yeah, uh, so one of the
first things that we realized uh
as we were as we were assisting
people with applications, mostly
in person at our food pantries
was due to New Mexico's huge
geographic area, you know, we
can only be in one place at one
time.
Uh, so that's when we developed
a help center, a call center
where we could help people over
the phone. That was about the
same time that New Mexico, uh
acquired a a online snap and
public benefits application.
Uh, this really freed us up
because we were, we were then
able to, uh, through Google Ads
and other marketing services, we
were able to help people all
across the state apply for SNAP
and other public benefits as
well. Um,
I'm going to move it over and
let my colleague Shannon Hudson,
uh, go through some of the
specifics of that and uh tell us
another story there.
Mm
Jason, thank you, Mr. Chair and
members of the committee for
having us today. Um,
Is this better? OK, cool. Thank
you. Um, thank you for having
us, Mr. Chair and members of the
committee, we're happy to be
here to talk about this, so, uh,
Jason was just talking about our
help center which we receive
referrals from all 33 counties
in New Mexico, um, to assist
with their applications for SNAP
and other public benefits over
the phone. That's been wildly
successful, but we realize um
that we really would like to get
into the into rural communities
and have a face in
rural communities to help people
who are not, um, getting access
to computers, the Internet,
Googling Snap to find us. So we
want to be out there. We want to
be in person, um, to help people
apply for SNAP. So I'm going to
go ahead and talk about our SNAP
clinics. So we identify high
need areas and basically take
our desks to, um, those high
need areas, especially rural
areas, we'll take our global
hotspots, our laptops.
And our setups to, um,
Senior centers, libraries,
community centers, even just
find a parking lot and set up
our tent to be outside. Um, so
that we can do SNAP applications
on the spot with folks in the
community.
Um, and that's where my story
will come, so her name has been
changed, but, uh, let's say her
name is Dina. We met her at the
um.
The Cuba Senior Center, so rural
Sandoval County, um, we were
invited to set up SNAP clinic on
their bingo day right before
bingo day and it got pretty
popping in there.
Um, there was a bunch of people
coming up to our table and, um,
asking what is SNAP? A lot of
people, I was surprised hadn't
heard of the program before. Did
not know that they were
eligible, like Dina, who Dina,
uh.
72 years old, raising two
grandchildren in her home and,
uh, making a total of 873 young
Social Security per month, $73
for a 3-person household. I was
shocked that she wasn't already
on SNAP.
But we were able to fill out
that application for her right
there and then which, um, we're
very.
I'm very happy that we were able
to do that and the next month
we'll go on bingo day again and
follow up with her, see how she,
um, how it's working out if she
needs help uploading any
documents to the, um, yes, New
Mexico, which is where people
apply for SNAP,
uh, online.
If she needs help uploading
documents. She's got her
interview set up for, uh, with
HCA yet. She's already done it,
etc. just to have that follow
up, follow through, make sure
she doesn't need any other food
resources while we're out there,
um, and
And continue that relationship
just beyond the phone calls. So
we're really happy to do that.
We're, we're able to do that
because of, um, the additional
support that comes from the
state outreach fund, the
matching funds because we're
able to have the staff that, you
know, first of all has the
capacity to travel um outside of
Albuquerque, our home base
office and uh also the
technology, the laptops and the
hotspots, those
Um, all the money in our budget
for next year comes from the
The state outreach plan and, uh,
and we're just finding it's
growing more and more every time
we go out somewhere, somehow
somebody else, uh, knows about
us and then they ask us to come
to their senior center, so we're
at Cuba. Now we'll go to Turon,
um, which is also in Sandoval
County because the word spreads
fast and we're learning that
we're, we're even outgrowing
what we've got so far, so.
Um, it's been very beneficial,
so far and.
Because of that, um.
And it just, I'm sorry.
So because of the Snap outreach.
Plan snap outreach program, uh,
in partnership with the state,
we have been able to really
establish a relationship with
the healthcare authority. It
increases our communication when
there was a heavy backlog with
uh processing Snap applications.
We were able to keep in regular
communication with um the
healthcare authority and then
then refer
Information back to the
community members that we serve,
which is helpful in eliminating
um commun eliminating
communication barriers, um,
And
Apprehension for applying
because of, you know, the wait
time so we can encourage people
to apply because we have the
information of, um,
From the, from the healthcare
authority.
Uh, we also are we're able to
increase our staff size, uh,
which.
Thereby increases our capacity a
lot we were able to hire um.
One of our part-time
representatives on full time,
which is excellent. It's
excellent for her, it's
excellent for us. And then we
were also able to bring on um
another part-time representative
who is bilingual and tired
social workers, so we're really,
really happy to have him on
board as well.
Um, and then I'm gonna just go
ahead and pass it back to Jason.
Sorry.
One of the other, uh,
Outreach activities that
Shannon's team is now doing is a
regular visit to the VA, uh,
working with veterans who are
often very, very hesitant to
engage in any kind of government
programs and, uh, oftentimes
very hesitant to go into a.
Government office with large
crowds. Uh, so that's been very,
very helpful, uh, turning your
attention to page, uh, is it 29?
OK.
Um, so Feeding America developed
a snap impact calculator in food
banks we often turn the poundage
of food on our trucks into
meals, uh, Feeding America
wanted a way for all these
fledgling SNAP programs, uh, to,
uh, have a way to show how many
meals the application provides
and, uh, as, um, Cody did
mention, uh, there is a, a real
economic impact to having a
federal dollar come into the
state of New Mexico.
Um.
During this period that we've
received the support from the
state of New Mexico via these
federal matching funds, so this
is just October 2023 to last
month, uh, Shannon's team
completed 271 SNAP applications.
Uh, that's going to provide
239,000286 meals. That would be
a lot of Road Runner Food Bank
mobile food pantries.
The uh the benefits generated,
so this is how much uh how much
is actually going on to the EBT
cards of 271 households is
887,751. And again, that's gonna
be a, uh, a local economic
impact of over $1.3 million. So
that's funds coming into the
state. Uh, another thing I'd
like to point out, you know, we
have a lot of small towns in New
Mexico, a lot of rural areas.
Uh, so when that money is going
into that rural.
Are being spent in that rural
area, uh, can really, really
have a positive effect and um I
think one of the, one of the
great things about being able to
increase the amount of in-person
outreach is, uh, similar to what
the uh the folks have presented
Project Echo said, you know, you
have a trusted entity talking
about a government program and
being able to dispel a lot of
the myths that are out there
that people to this day believe,
uh, people on Snap and not on
Snap that they still believe and
It's quite a, quite a difference
in those communities talking one
on one.
And I will turn it back over to
Cody.
Mr. Chairman and members of this
committee, um, at this time
we're finished with our
presentations and we're we'll
open it up to questions. Thank
you.
Members of the committee, let's
start, oh.
Welcome,
Representative. I'm sorry, you
forfeited all chance to ask
questions.
Senator Cedilo Lopez, let's
start with you. We'll go this
way and come around this way.
Thank you for this presentation.
I was just sort of stunned that
it's only for $150,000 and it
does so much um, how realistic
that the OK.
I, uh, my own personal opinion
is it's not enough. Um, so what
How realistic do you, do you
think, I mean, I was impressed
with what's already been
happening, but is this gonna be
scaled properly to,
oh, is this gonna be, Mr. Chair,
thank you. Um, is this going to
be scaled properly to make sure
that it, it really gets out and
one of the other issues is, I
know in immigrant communities,
there's a lot of fear about
accepting any kind of government
benefits. And my understanding
is SNAP is available to
children.
In those kinds of families and
also, so anyway, if you could
address that, I honestly, I
think $150,000 is so low I could
give it to you as a junior or as
a whatever, yeah, Mr. Chair and
members of the committee, to
your question, I think what
really helps is, um,
An example, Road Runner Food
Bank had been doing this, uh,
their snap outreach plan since
2013. So that was their own like
internal outreach plan. So I
think what really this um just
this modest investment of
$150,000 will really help
smaller communities,
organizations like Roadrunner,
um, help them in by giving them
grants to pay them for things
that they're already doing. So I
think as a starting off point, I
think this would be good to have
as a good investment.
as, uh,
As a staff outreach plan is
entering its 2nd year, and I
think over time we can
continually see if more
organizations can come and
invest in the snap outreach plan
like Road Runner did in his
first year and continually
seeing if we can get more and
more and more into invest more
into the Snap outreach plans and
um,
Like you said for your second
thing regarding um immigrants
and uh accessing Snap, yes,
that's, that's a big thing.
There's a lot of myths talking
about, uh, one big thing is the
public charge. Immigrants are
really worried about um if they
access SNAP benefits, will that
impact their immigration status?
Will the impact like whether or
not there's uh seeking their
green card, and that's something
that, you know, through our our
uh through the snap outreach
program, what we can do is
really
That's in education and telling
uh immigrant families.
What Snap is and what is not,
and I think that's really a good
opportunity when with Roadrunner
being at the forefront with
their network can really help
dispel those myths. In addition,
uh, we offer at the New Mexico
Center on Poverty. We also do a
bunch of trainings as well and
always are happy to help out and
supplement Road Runner and
whatever they do regarding
immigrant access and I just want
to follow up with I know that
Roadrunner has been really
excellent about not, uh,
discouraging immigrants, but
there's some other food banks.
Around the state that I've seen
that require people to prove
their citizenship and
unbelievable, um, requirements,
even, even uh.
Uh, with SNAP benefits, uh, if,
if someone needs a Social
Security number, they, they need
to be a legal permanent resident
for 5 years, I believe, um, in
order to qualify,
uh, but if there is a uh a
family maybe mixed status, then
they can apply on behalf of
American born children or
children that are legal
permanent residents just to make
sure we have that. Um, and as,
as far as, you know, any, any
food banks, uh, requiring that,
um, I mean, range of
possibility.
range of questions. I, I, I, I
could have for you on that, but
um,
That could be referring to the
TFAT program, where there's a
self-declaration form.
Uh, that, that's all I can
speculate and, and certainly if,
if, uh, if there is any issues
or, or people are, you know, not
being provided the food they
need and there's some barrier to
that, uh, you know, we would be
happy to address that and find
out if if that's one of our
partner agencies, uh, one of our
300 partner agencies are fellow
food banks or, you know, a
different organization that we
don't work with, but that's
always concerning to hear.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Represented, let's go this way.
Representative Taro Harramillo.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Uh, so I
just want to get back to the,
uh, 2013 you created this, uh,
snap outreach. And, uh, and so
it was just funded in 2023. And,
and so how many snap outreach,
uh, agencies are there in New
Mexico, and I think I'm just
shocked that, that there wasn't
one before that.
Um, so yeah, Road Runner started
its own Snap Outreach and, and
just to clarify the terms we're,
we're referring to a
community-based organization
going out helping people apply
or spreading, you know,
education about SNAP, uh, and
other public benefits, I should
say.
Um, that was started in 2013.
Uh, there, there are, uh, a
handful of organizations that
are out there doing this, um,
with their own funding, uh, and,
and to be clear, the, the, the
generous funding we are getting
through this Snap outreach plan
submitted by the state. It's
60,000, but that's a percentage
of our overall budget that the
program takes. So we're, we're,
uh, we are hoping for expansion
of that and, uh, uh, I think
this legislation would
definitely help towards that.
Um, to answer your question, I
apologize and I I failed to
recognize the chair. I apologize
for that.
Tough gig, um.
Uh, yeah, there are a lot of
organizations doing it, but
unofficially, there are social
workers, nurses, care providers,
grandchildren doing their own
version of Snap Outreach
constantly. Uh, so I think the,
the $150,000 ask will make it
very possible for smaller
organizations, maybe not quite
as, I don't want to say well
funded as Roadrunner Food Bank,
but maybe not as funded as Road
Runner Food Bank. Uh, it opens
up that possibility of grants so
they can really.
That their Snap outreach
program.
Mr. Chair, second, how does the
community communicate with you
to request this, um, outreach
in, in their community.
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, in order to for a
smaller organizations to get
this funding for the Snap
outreach plan through the USDA,
they would have to apply um with
through the healthcare authority
to receive that grant funding.
So to clarify, Mr. Chair, more
specifically to have roadrunner
food bank come in and do the
outreach at our senior center.
How would we communicate with
you to do that,
yeah, we, we, uh, we'd be happy
to look into that again, uh
thank you Mr. Chair,
uh, you know, it depends on
availability. We still are a
pretty small staff, pretty small
team, um, but there's different
ways we can do it and you know,
we can certainly, uh, one of the
great things is when we have a
community.
Based organization, at least
handing out our flyers and our
information so that people can
then call our help center from
wherever they are, and we can
help them over the phone, but
um, yeah, I'd be happy to
provide my email and whatever
context we we need to do that,
yeah, we have cards available
and everything, so certainly,
yeah, that's, that's what we're
here to do.
Thank you so much, uh, living in
rural community and I thank you
for the, uh, Roadrunner food
truck that, that, um, we help
distribute food at Alamo Navajo
reservation. I appreciate that.
And, um, I would see that this
would be vital, so I will be
taking your card so that we can
help our community. Thank you so
much, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Representative
Representative Royal Caballero.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank
you so much, um, for your
presentation. This is really
helpful, um.
On page 5 I'm going to refer
several of my questions to
Uh, some of the data that you
have there. So first question is
your last uh.
We
OK.
Let me, I usually talk very
loud, but.
Somehow it's not projecting, OK.
Is that better?
OK, good. So your last graph
talks about over 67% were
families with children.
The middle graph is over 27%.
Older adults were disabled
members. Do we know how many of
those older adults.
are included in that 67%.
Because I know that families are
now mothers, grandmothers,
aunties, whatever are living
together. Do we have an idea of
how many are in that category?
Mr. Chairman and members of the
committee. I don't know the
specifics of how much they
overlap, but because in Mexico
has it's such a mixed household
uh state. I would imagine that
these, these numbers uh between
those in the middle graph in the
on the far right does overlap as
well. So thank you, Mr. Chair.
So it's a fair assumption to, to
make that they're probably most
likely.
is an overlap. OK, thank you.
And then the other um.
Number that was really appalling
is the 47% were working
households because that helps
dispel this notion that, um, you
know, if you're working, you're
OK, but not if you're working
and making.
Minimum wage because we know
that minimum wage is not a
living wage. So that's very
helpful and, um, it would be
helpful to look at a graph that
shows
The wage association with that,
with that graph, with that 47%,
uh, it would be helpful for
those of us that are looking at
um ways in which to increase
income, household income from
other avenues, raising the
living wage and so on. So that
would be a very helpful, um.
piece of information the other
um I have two other.
Concerns. One has to do with our
immigrant community.
Um, as we know nationally we
have, I forget the figures now,
it keeps rolling 13 million
maybe undocumented in the nation
and in our state we have a huge,
uh, number, uh, and we know
that.
Those immigrant families are
also living together with their
US citizen families and they're
trying to create these pathways
to citizenship, um, from the
immigration standpoint, so your
5 year legal permanent residency
could mean that there's several
multiple families that are
living in these circumstances.
I'm concerned about how much
advocacy we're we're doing at
the federal level to look at
eliminating a lot of barriers to
accessing, uh, food in this
case, food because we already
have we already know and you've
told us, uh, and Feeding America
has told us and everybody else
that food and hunger and access
to food is a huge impediment to
education and all the others,
but is there something we could
do uh
At that level to advocate since
our state is as representative
uh Jaramillo mentioned earlier,
50th, 49, 50th, 49th, and so
many of these categories.
Mr. Chairman and members of the
committee, I think that really
the best way is making sure that
we're educating our immigrant
families about the application
process and what's required and
also ensuring that when the
Mexican immigrant families are
applying through the healthcare
authority that we're we're being
very transparent as what
documents were requesting and
making sure that um immigrant
families when they do ask for
program information about how to
apply the snap and whether
they're eligible that the
healthcare.
Authority provides them with
that, uh, the accurate
information and they don't have,
and also informing them that
they don't have, it won't impact
their immigrant status as well.
So I think that education and
transparency could be our best
tool as a state, as the nation's
kind of figures out everything
else regarding um immigrants
accessing Snap. Just a
clarification, I know in my time
is up, but just one
clarification on that note, does
that include advocacy for the
and grievance processes because
I know that there are a lot of
issues with that. So just a yes
or no or would that be something
that would be considered? Mr.
Chairman, members of the
committee, yes, absolutely.
Representative Chavez.
Thank you
Madam Vice Chair, um.
So I have a couple of questions.
I, I, I need a clarification,
um, did you say that?
Or did I hear you say that the
regional food banks are also
doing this kind of work?
In terms of um with SNAP
specifically.
Uh, Madam Vice Chair and
Representative Chavez, uh.
Yes, the uh, the, the Food Bank
of Eastern New Mexico, um, they,
they were doing snap outreach.
I, I believe they may have lost
some personnel, so they could be
in between right now, uh, also
Eco Food Bank has begun doing
snap outreach as well. the food
depot in Santa Fe, uh, with
their city navigators has been
doing outreach, so, uh, and
then, uh, of course, Shannon has
trained a lot of our food bank
or I'm sorry, food uh pantry
partner agency.
to do theirs. Uh, it can be
difficult, especially, you know,
when these kind of organizations
are.
Often very short staffed. OK,
thank you. Um, so the other I
have two more questions. So this
morning we heard a presentation
from Quidando Los Ns in terms of
some of the difficulties or
barriers that homeless families
have and one of them was lack of
a utility bill.
Are there, are you experiencing
those kinds of things as well
and what recommendations do you
have to um make it easier for
folks to apply for SNAP.
Uh, Mr. Chairman,
representatives of the of the
committee, um, just to clarify,
uh, people experiencing
homelessness, lacking utility
bill in order to to get services
to get snapped, um,
good, Jen.
Um,
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and
Representative Chavez, so, um,
In terms of a utility bill in
order to access Snap, that would
not be a requirement, but I do
think I know what you're talking
about as some of um,
The local pantries will require
a utility bill or proof of
residency in order to get food
services in general. Um, I
personally don't like that
practice. I think that our, um,
our team of
Uh, they were called the agents,
uh our partner, um, support
specialists. I think they're
really moving towards
encouraging partners to not
require those proofs of
residency because that is a pain
point, especially, um,
In in areas with with high
Homeless population, so. And
then the other question that I
have and it's on page, um, or on
slide 23, interpretation
services for outreach workers,
um, are you, are your outreach
workers not bilingual? Is that
why you're, you have that bullet
point there.
Mr. Chair and members of the
committee, I would say um.
Right now, a lot of, we heard
just like Road Runner Food Bank
has their own snap outreach
plan, and we can imagine like
different food banks and
different organizations have
their own like snap outreach
plan that they fund themselves.
So what this grant would do
would really help them um either
hire someone if they don't
already have an interpreter or
for example, at Road Runner Food
Bank to maybe um increase the
interpretation levels or more
training or access to an
interpretation service. So I
think it's really looking at
expanding.
What is already existing at
these community organizations.
OK, can I just ask a follow-up
question? Is, is, well, I know,
but I, but I usually don't. Um,
so when you're hiring folks and
I'm, you can't speak to the
other food banks, but maybe for
Roadrunner. Are you, are you
looking for people that are
bilingual so that you don't have
to rely on interpreters. Thank
you, Mr. Chair and
Representative Chavez, yes, so
that was part of, um, bringing
on our newest.
was a bilingual requirement in
Spanish, but for example, um, at
the same place where I helped
Dina from my um story. I also
helped a 91 year old woman who
only spoke Dane, and the only
reason I was able to help her
was because her niece was there
to translate. So there's a lot
of different languages that
sometimes come up we have to, we
have 1 full-time, um,
Staff member who is
bilingual with Spanish and then
now one part time Spanish
representative, but those, uh,
other languages that are spoken
in our community do pop up and
we will need translation
services, especially Vietnamese,
um, Chinese has come up as well,
so.
Uh, representative Johnson.
Thank you.
Mr. Chair, Madam Chair, and
presenters, I just want to say
thank you. I, I reserve my time.
I might have a lot to say
tomorrow.
Representative Herndon.
Thank you, Madam Vice Chair, and
uh Shannon, uh, Madam Shannon,
what is the, the question that's
coming up exactly what does it
take to qualify for SNAP? Is it
100 50% of federal poverty or
what is that? If you could
answer for our audience. That is
a great question. So the state
has deductions that go into
place after you meet 165% of the
federal poverty, um, line as of
now.
But, um, why the state outreach
plan is really so essential to
us coming up is because in
October that um that threshold
is going to increase to 200% of
the FPL
in starting October 1st, so, um,
we're really excited to do more
outreach, uh, targeting the
folks that
Will now become eligible because
of that. Thank you, Madam Chair
and thank you, Shannon. And the
other question that arose is
with respect to the uh
information that's shown, I
think it was the 221.
Um, applications that you
process, how long is it taking
to process once you submit an
application, how long is it
gonna take someone to get their
staff benefits?
Well, we are so thankful because
for the past year, it was taking
up to like 3 months in order for
HCA to process it. But now, um,
we are calling our neighbors
back who we've assisted and it's
at like 2 weeks, people are
getting approved in two week
turnaround at this point. So
we're super grateful for the
really hard work that HCA has
done to
To make that happen.
Right, and thank you. And the
final question that came up was,
are you giving SNAP benefits to
students? And is it the 200
percent of federal poverty level
doesn't matter if they're a
student or not.
Whether they're dependent or
not, um, so students are, um,
kind of unique when it comes to,
uh, Mr. Chairman,
Representative, uh, Herndon, uh,
uh, yeah, students unfortunately
are unique. The rules are a
little different from them, uh,
and, uh, in my humble opinion,
this has really led to a lot of,
a lot of food insecurity on
campuses nationwide.
Um, but pretty much when you
qualify for SNAP, you're going
to be qualified by household
size versus income.
So we will, uh, sorry.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. So we will
help students um apply for SNAP,
um, but they requirements are a
little bit more intricate
unfortunately, but we will of
course help apply and educate on
their eligibility.
All right, thank you, Madam Vice
Chair, Shannon.
Representative Vincent.
Thank you, Madam Chair. So most
of my questions were answered. I
do have because, uh, my district
has experienced so much
devastation in the last 65 days.
Um, I, I've seen a huge uptick
in the need for food.
And what I was hoping is these
particular documents right here,
is there any way that I could
get a an electronic of those to
where I could maybe put them on
my website and you know, get
people some, some help that they
may need.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and
Representative Vincent, uh,
absolutely, we can get, get
those to you.
Yeah.
It is, but I, I looked on the
website and it's not there. No,
sir.
Yeah that
Yeah.
Oh, thank you. OK. And um.
Mr. Chair, Representative
Vincent, um, yeah, the, uh, one
of those flyers has been emailed
to you for our, our conversation
and uh we are, we are happy to
get those flyers out to anyone
else that wants to request it
for their constituents. Uh, I'd
also like to uh let people know
that they can go to our website
RRFB.org stands for Road Runner
Foodbank RRFB.org. Um, we have a
whole page dedicated to helping
people apply for SNAP and other
benefits, uh, someone can fill
out a form very easily or call.
Number that's that's available
there. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. And also
just want to throw a plug in
helping uh Carazozo get their
food bank up and running, so we
got one in another community.
Thank you.
Representative, uh,
Representative Chasey. OK,
Representative Ferrari. you did
such a great job of asking
questions, um, Madam Chair, Mr.
Chair, um, I just was wondering,
um, is the senior program, the
fast books that you can go and
buy food. Is that you don't
handle that at all?
Through Road Runner.
Are you talking about the um
farmers' market with the
seniors. So actually, um, we do
help.
Apply if if a senior is
interested, well, we can help
apply for SNAP and then we've
also been, um, helping apply for
that program as well this
summer, so, oh, that's great
cause I think that's really good
for nutritional food and helping
our farmers too.
So good. Thank you and I'm sorry
I didn't recognize the chair but
yes,
there's no pit that will open
and drop you know.
Thank you for the question,
Representative is there any
limit of how much we can spend
that the federal government will
match.
Mr. Chair and members of the
committee know, uh, I don't
believe there's a limit, so.
Maybe we'll just put a 0 on that
150,000. Thank you. OK, sounds
good. Thank you so much for all
your great effort.
I do have in light of the
that's OK. I'll take, we have
the same with the two Ts, um, do
you, um, Mr. Chair, do you
receive federal, you obviously
receive federal funds. And in
doing so, you probably are most
uh have to submit a language
access plan.
Um, are you able to share that
plan with us?
Mr. Chair.
Um, Mr. Chair and members of the
committee, uh,
When the state has to submit uh.
Each year in August, the state
submit a snap outreach plan
through the to the USDA and in
that plan, they have um
Let me step back to each year,
the USDA lists like priority
areas that states should go and
kind of like impact, for
example, rural communities,
they'll ask uh states to focus
on veterans or for example, uh,
language access. So if it, if a,
um, if an organization has uh a
plan or they want to do more uh
language access, they would have
to detail that in the staff
outreach plan that the state
submits in August.
Isn't it, is it under statute
that they have to do that, Mr.
Chair?
Mr. Chair and members of the
committee, know, uh, it is not
in statute, so that's why we're
really pushing to make sure it
like have the healthcare
authority to do that each year.
I appreciate that information
and feedback and then I'm just.
I'm just looking at your
information and the $150 150,000
dollars investment is just for
the snap outreach is what I'm
reading. But then what our
representative Ferrari brought
up in that matching. And if
there's not a cap on that
matching, what is, uh, what is
the Road Runner Food bank going
to be asking the state for
funding this year, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Chair.
Representative, um, so it is a
federal matching funds that go
through the state, uh, so for FY
24 I'm sorry, 25, uh, we
requested another $60,000.
Just through this program, but
so that overall your road road
or bank isn't going to be asking
the state separately for other
funding. Yes, Roadrunner is
asking for other funding not
related to the snap out. I mean
we're not related to the snap
because if we have a leverage
like that, it's huge and so
maybe we'll talk offline about
that. Thank you, Mr. Chair. you.
Thank you. I, I have just a few
things, um.
I am actually embarrassed that
Roadrunner had to do that as
opposed to the state government
coming up with some money for, I
mean, that's, that's
unconscionable, um, especially
$60,000. I mean that literally
is pocket change. So I apologize
to everyone for the state's
falling down on that. Um, and
then just, I have volunteered at
Road Runner, um, and it's fun,
so I'm encouraging folks. I'm
actually thinking.
of maybe trying to put together
a volunteer day where
legislators and candidates and
whoever comes and helps. So keep
that in mind, um, and then just
one final thing, and it's a plug
for Representative Johnson and
I, um, that Cody Jeff is from
Crown Point.
Woohoo.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Um, and I had a few questions.
The 150,000 you're, you're,
you're,
uh,
Suggesting the appropriated, is
that, is that gonna be 150,000
to the healthcare authority for
this program? Is that where
that's gonna go, Mr. Chair and
members of the committee, yes,
that's right. Are they asking
for it? Do they put it into
their budget? No, they did not
include in their budget.
Healthcare Authority.
The people that run the food
stamp program.
So, Mr. Chair, um, I did put it
we're we're allowed to put in
requests to the, um, HAFC and I
did put in a request for this.
So not that that matters, but I,
I'm trying. Yeah, good.
OK, well that, that, that fills
it. What is the usual match on
the, you said the the program is
100% funded in the, in terms of
the food, and then 50/50, is it
50/50? Is that the match the
administrative match, or is
there a different.
Formula for administrative
match. Mr. Chairman and members
of the committee, yes, it's a
50% for the administration, the
state pays for half and the
federal government pays the rest
of the half or administering
those benefits and all the
states is 50/50. We have a
really nice match for TAF and
other things, but Medicaid a
great one, but not for this,
huh? That's right, OK,
um.
Um.
OK, so um the
Did you also take uh let me
just, there's a better question
for me to ask, and I don't want
it to go on too long.
That
The state used to have
A way to apply for SNAP just by
coming in in person. They still
do that, right? So do they, when
you go out on, on to one of
these you know, outreach events
like to the bingo or so on, is
there, are you able to just take
the paperwork back and, and,
and, and, and, or they have to
do it online.
Uh, thank you, Mr. Chair. So
you, we could do paper
applications. Um, there's
benefit to them. They can go a
lot quicker, but the benefit of
doing the online applications is
that they are instantly
submitted and it doesn't, uh,
take like a long time to get to
an FAA, which is a family
something in now, um, uh, to
process. It's a lot quicker and
more thorough if the
applications are completed
online, but that doesn't.
Um, rule out paper applications
totally other programs, um, if
it works better for them, like
the smaller organizations that
might be interested in
participating in the state snap
outreach plan. I would encourage
them to use whatever works best
for them, including paper
applications.
I was just thinking the parts of
the state that still don't have
internet access, so those parts
of the state you could do on
your outreach efforts, you could
do paper applications.
Uh, that is correct, Mr. Chair.
And then the last question is
just we had another program and
I don't know if it still exists,
the for senior citizens, the
minimal purchase of, uh, we
could.
We had all state funding for
minimal purchases of food
stamps, but you, you're not,
you're not selling them anymore,
uh.
I forget how that worked. Did
anybody remember that? Anybody
else?
Well, Senator, um, Liz Stefanix
is the one that used to always
put that in and I can't remember
how it worked. Do you remember
Jim, how, how that works? The
minimal purchase because I
guess.
But if you're not buying it,
what, what difference does it
make? I don't know.
Um, Mr. Chair, uh, you could be
a few different things that
we're, you know, familiar with.
There, there was the uh farmers'
market, um, certificates and uh
yeah, it could have been or, or
could have been a, um, not fit,
but what do you call it, the
Wick thank God, thank you.
Yeah, it is, it's my birthday.
I'm 82, so yeah, to make certain
allowances.
But if I want to buy a uh
uh a minimal food stamp. I, I, I
guess I'll have to find out some
other from some other source
whether that even exists
anymore.
OK.
Um, Mr. Chair, I believe you're
talking about the double ups
double up bus program that's the
one at the food markets, right,
where farmers' markets and
seniors specifically, I'll ask
senators to panic. She, she,
she's the one that always used
to introduce that. Do you
remember that? No, but she'll be
here tomorrow. OK, we'll ask her
tomorrow when she comes.
Anybody else have any other
questions they wanna ask I wanna
thank you, you know, this is
probably the only opportunity
we'll have to talk about, uh,
the, the SNAP program, uh, this
interim. So it's been really
helpful. We wish you good luck.
We've got a good advocate here
to try to put that money into
the budget,
um, if it goes in, they won't
fight it, I don't think, but
they didn't, it wasn't a big
enough amount. You should have
asked for $2 million. That way
you could have, they would have
made it a priority.
Um
So with that, we'll we'll thank
you and, and, uh, members
tomorrow morning, we have two
important presentations one, the
primary care association, and
the other one is from the
Healthcare authority on the
waiver program, the DD waiver
program. Both of those are, are
pretty meaty things and then we
wanted to save enough time to do
some initial brainstorming
around legislation that you
might want to begin, begin
identifying.
So with that, we'll, we'll call
the meeting adjourned for the
day and see you tomorrow morning
at 9:15, before we keep changing
the time
with the budget stuff real
quick.
Yeah, one more question on the
budget stuff I'm sorry, you
included already in the food
farm and hunger, um, you know, a
group of um.
Funding
for different projects Mr. Chair
Representative for the food,
yeah, Road Runner Food Bank and
the Association of New Mexico
Food Banks is included in that.
Um, to my knowledge, uh, you
know, none of that has budget
for any kind of snap outreach or
any of the work that Shannon's
team is doing. OK, so we do need
to do that separately. OK,
thanks. We just wanted to make
sure we weren't doubling up on
the double food, no, not at all.
Thank you.
So.
Um, and, and then also one last
thing for the members, there is
that uh reception tonight, uh,
at the president's house, do we
know where the president's house
is?
That
It's at 6 o'clock and it's for
all, it's for both committees, I
think, uh, both the water.
It's at.
3:30 McCutcheon Avenue.
Um,
McCutcheon Avenue West Socorro.
At
666 to 9. It says appetizers and
drinks, so you're gonna have to
really load up on the
appetizers, I think you want to
get dinner out of the deal, but
it, it's very nice they're
offering it to us. Where is?
I, I don't know Sakora well
enough to know where that is,
but we did get an email about
it. Was it, what was it?
Is it right on campus
and then straight to M.
Oh OK, so it's down by the
plaza.
What
The Sikora Plaza, the plaza, the
Sakura Plaza.
The center of town.
It's girl.
Yeah.
That's
That's, that's it. No, it's not
on campus. It's not on campus,
right? I should have put a time
limit on this discussion.
There's a story there you talk
about it.
