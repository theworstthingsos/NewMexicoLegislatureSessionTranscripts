Senator Wirth. Uh, thank you,
Madam President, I ask unanimous
consent of the Senate. The
records show all acts of
replacing House Judiciary
Committee substitute for House
Uh, thank you, Madam President.
House Bill 66, uh, is
legislation that came out of a
task force, House Memorial 83,
workers of insurance companies
and those that participate in
the workers' compensation
system, and they issued a
recommendation and report that
recommended raising the attorney
fee cap from
other step ups in the bill, we
can talk about that when we get
into it, uh, and they basically
decided not to make any other
changes. So the changes in this
bill to the workers' comp system
in the room and came up.
with a, a mechanism uh where
insured and those employers are
able to address claims and help
increased in this bill have not
been increased, uh, since 2013
and basically, if you just run
an inflation calculator, they're
amount that can be awarded in a
successful case, assuming that
the judge approves that amount
and then the discovery costs
have not been changed since
Uh, it's important to make sure
that this system, this
compromise works and with that
I'm happy to stand for questions
and Madam President, I do have
Senator Woods.
I thank you, Madam President.
um, I noticed in my analysis
here, if the good senator would
counties that they say, well,
likely increase costs associated
with workers' comp.
Patient claims
to maintain the 2013 status quo,
which is where that expense is
now, but again, it's gonna move
it up uh and address the
inflationary increase, uh, and
cases. This is an area of law
that's very, very specialized,
uh, but again, I think all we're
doing is an inflationary
increase of the fees and
discovery costs, but I can't say
force where all the parties work
together to come up with this.
Cinder Woods, well, I, I
appreciate that, but, uh, they
$270,000. Would that be paid by
the, by the claims, the, the,
the insurers, how, tell me a
little more about the cost,
terms of how the fees get paid,
uh, you'll see in the bill, and
this is all existing law, the
answer is
It depends on the workers'
compensation law right now,
all paid by one side or not paid
at all, um, and again, the judge
in the workers' comp judge will
make that determination, but it
really depends on, on the
process that they go through and
can please escort the.
Expert onto the floor.
Senator Woods, you still have
the floor.
You know, I understand that in
the past, the only reason I know
much about this is, is, uh,
Of course, agriculture was, was
put into the
And uh so I had to learn things
in my business.
To, uh
You know, to
this and I was on task force and
everything else while I was,
before I was a legislature and,
They had as many as
You know, they had multiple
clients at one time, multiple
clients.
And I don't know if there's any
time that, you know, this is
just kind of ABC if, if you do
this ABC, then, uh,
you represent that between,
a claim, uh, that it wasn't the
employer's.
You know, fault, it, it's
supposed to be a no, no fault
insurance is what it's supposed
No, I I didn't mean it out. I'm
sorry, that's what my analysis
is. Maybe that's amended out.
Mr. Pris Madam President, I
Judiciary Committee Substitute.
It's $30,000 in calendar year
2025, beginning in 20 January
1st, 27, it goes up to 32,000
2029 on page nine, on May, by
May 1st of 2029, the advisory
Council on Workers' Compensation
is going to review the allowable
attorneys' fees and the
bunch of kind of
representations. I'd also like
to just respond to why this
isn't just a rubber stamp type
deal, and the rubber stamp
the majority 93% of the cases
don't reach the cap at $22,000.
The reason this is necessary,
though, is that there are cases,
and I'll give you an example of
basically this attorney has been
representing that client for 7
years with a cap of $220,500
complicated cases.
It's only fair that.
Workers have access to the
process and are able to get
So, but, but what I'm getting
at, you're taking the birding
off the, the, the client and
saying that's not correct. So
again, the typical one is the
claimant pays half the fee and
the employer pays half the fee,
but there are fee shifting
to try and get these cases
resolved, and I think that's
what's encouraged, and then
depending on whether an offer is
accepted, depending on the
amount that the worker.
cop judge awards at the end,
There's now going to be a little
more room, again, adjusted for
inflation, so that workers can
be able to have representation
in those types of cases.
CPI, any increases guaranteed
type increases. My only problem
with that, in the business that
I'm in, I don't have that
guarantee, Madam President.
I don't have a, a huge amount of
negotiation because you see a
seed of wheat is the same as the
seed weed in Kansas, a cedar
weed in Texas. I sell wheat.
Just saying, Madam President,
thank you very much.
Thank you, Senator Woods.
Senator Sidia Lopez.
Does this bill, um,
cap uh employers' attorneys?
Madam President, excuse me, um,
basically it's this, this
attorney's fee amount is the cap
that applies to both the workers
I'm, I'm really happy to see
that because when um,
In the old days when it didn't
cap employers workers, um,
these complicated cases are the
cases that.
Lawyers don't have an incentive
to take because of this $22,000
he became a worker's
compensation judge, did that for
about 6 years and then became a
district judge, um, and so my
knowledge of workers' comp is is
And the workers that we
understand that it is a
compromise and that it's really
important to keep this
compromise vital.
Um, and then, and especially in
the complex cases, and this is a
lifetime cap. I know my husband
did a lot of work after his cap
and I believe, I don't remember
attorneys do pro bono, they also
have to make a living and so
trying to keep this cap and pace
with in in place with uh.
Inflation
get this to keep up with their
cost of doing business, the cost
of inflation, but I think this
is a really important bill and
I'm really proud to, to stand in
favor of it, and I thank the
sponsor for bringing it.
we're in and when an employee is
injured and we had one stick his
finger in the wrong place the
other day. When you cap these
fees, it helps us create a
injured will get more money than
the attorney, and they know I
can charge up to $30,000 in, in
Senator.
I think that's correct in what
I'm reading the bill.
gets nothing.
So when we can cap fees at any
point in time, and, and they
know what they're gonna get and
if they want to take the cases
with the cap, and they can do
Accidents happen on job sites.
Accidents happen, uh, with
people could be no fault of
anyone. And so when they're
capped.
more money than than toy lawyer
gets and that's the purpose of
workers' comp.
I when injuries happen that
people get paid and they get
paid right.
this. This, this adds stability.
We had another bill about
workers' comp. We got to create
that stability and workers' comp
and this does that. So thank
you, Madam President.
Thank you, Senator. Senator
Tobiasson.
Thank you, Madam President. um,
Senator, I, I was just doing a
little research as, as you were
debating this spill, and I'm
curious what research do you
they are.
Um, independent practitioners is
at 13% and the profit margin of
hospital systems is in the
this bill around doctors and
hospitals and then with this
increase, um, secondly, I'm
concerned about a strain on
higher costs within the workers'
discovery increase in here will
help to pay the doctors, again,
who are critical to these cases.
So again, by having that number
brought somewhere closer,
although when I ran my little
for discovery expenses and
certainly the doctors that
participate in that.
will uh be able to receive those
fees. I don't have statistics
and this bill is not about
it's a contained system and all
we're doing is just making sure
that the fees have moved the
same way inflation moved. That's
what the bill does.
workers' comp system regularly
increasing uh payments for
doctors in the system and for
hospitals.
do things exactly along those
lines. We did have a bill the
other, uh, yesterday, I believe
Senator Munoz dealing with
workers' comp and how to fund
that, uh, but the key piece to
contained, it's a very unique
specialized area of law. There's
not that many lawyers that do
this. I've not done it, so full
President. Yet we don't know um
how that money would be
So, Madam President, I'm told
that the, the money comes
straight from the insurance
companies to the doctors who
participate in this.
Thank you, Madam President. So
So, Madam President, uh, I'm
being told that the workers'
Again, that's not in this bill,
but it's certainly on the radar.
Thank you, Madam President, and,
and I know I'm, I'm being a
stickler here, but um we're
So Madam President, we're going
from 22,000,500 to $30,000 were
calculator, I don't have the
exact, can't do that percentage
off the top of my head, but, uh,
again, I, when I plugged it into
my calculator though, this
Senator. I'm asking my um
nuclear
code friend here to see if he
can figure out that percentage.
I've put them on the spot. I'm
just curious about the
we're increasing one, we should
increase both, um, and then I'm,
I haven't even gotten to the
hospital part yet, but I
um, attorneys and doctors when
looks like it's 28% increase.
I'm being told, um, by retired
Lieutenant Colonel uh Block
here. Um, would you agree, Madam
witness to your right. Sounds
like that's definitely in the
range, and again, a little below
what inflation has been for
since 2013.
Thank you, Madam President, and
thank you, Senator for answering
my questions.
bit earlier. Uh, we heard that
someone could have a, a case
worth $100,000 so that the
attorney could charge $60,000
It is rule 16-105A of the rules
of professional conduct and
charging an unreasonable fee
would make an attorney lie.
uh, uh, vulnerable to a a
Uh, thank you, Madam President.
We'll the sponsor yield for a
question, please.
attorneys' fees come from?
So, Madam President, my experts
telling me that it comes from
the workers' comp insurance
a typical case. Half comes from
the workers' comp insurance
company, the other half comes
from the worker.
Where is that money?
Originating from.
If the
those 7% of cases that get to
the cap and in a typical case
where it's split 50/50, the
insurance company would pay
50% under this statutory scheme,
which is that compromise that
all the parties around the table
came up with back in the 1990s,
and I would note that this
So is the employer responsible
for purchasing this insurance,
And Madam President, this would
also impact uh.
The loss ratios that is that
employers.
that also accurate?
Madam President, I don't want
that, that's gonna certainly be
up to the insurance company as
to how they determine.
certainly assume if I'd had a
bunch of claims, yes, my fees
are gonna go up. That's how it
works.
And Madam President and Senator,
the state does not get involved
The charge that is now uh
attributable to the employer. Is
that correct?
Centworth.
So, so, Madam President, that is
the typically the correct when
when when the employer has
insurance. That's correct. There

fund and what kind of impact
projections there might be out
there as a consequence of this
legislation.
know exactly how much money is
in that fund. I'm looking at the
FIR to see if there's any.
of that fund on an annual
average.
So, Mr. President, I, I, I don't
really, again, it's not kind of
separate from this bill, but I
figured we might get into some
of this. So I don't have that
exact number in front of me.
for the number that was put in
here, there were some additional
negotiations by the parties on
either side, uh, which led to
the step up. Uh, it's not a CPI
in response to Senator Woods,
OK, Madam President and Senator,
those step up.
Uh, numbers are fairly
significant percentages of the
So this is going to be
additional net increases to
these expenses as we go forward.
Some man present kind of just
good. If, if we get a big bump
here, we could be, it could be
way below.
What inflation and CPI, I think
for all of us that have seen
conclude with just a statement
that I would sure like to know
what impact this will have on
those on that uh
claims, so with that, Madam
President, I yield, thank you,
Senator, for your answers.

this bill does is adds, uh, some

again, I commend the sponsors

the sponsor to yield. I just
want to make a few comments. The
only problem that I see as the
county commissioner, Madam
President, we had so many times
that the Ford Service would
because they'll sue over 10
different issues and if they get
one issue correct, they get all
their funds back for suing the
Forest Service, Madam President.
And that's the problem I think
is this bill gonna help and uh I
look forward to working with the
sponsor in the in the in the
interim and try and get
something done to help us with
that portion, Madam President,
thank you.
Madam President, happy to yield
for a question or two to yield.
Thank you, Madam President.
Uh, Senator, to what extent, if

was the leveraging. It, it gives
us the ability to take the state

recollection is that with this,
in fact, if you take a look, let
requirements of paragraph one,
so it has to be for a public
benefit, uh, and includes
treatment of private lands and
the division makes a written
determination that the
do that. So there's a balancing
test built into the statute, uh,
that does allow, uh, again, when
When the work is needed.
Scott, Madam President, I think
that my question might have been
misunderstood. I guess the
question would relate to, uh,
Madam President, I do think
that's going to occur. I think
that, and again, and that's
going on right now. Every single
think under this certainly the
whole idea is to go in and
create buffers around our
wildland urban interfaces and
into that lumber and how that
all gets handled. I don't know
the answer to that, probably
under the current statute,
there's provisions or, or ways
that that happens. I just, I

concerned about the issues,
especially as we're expecting a
dry, a dry summer because we've
had a dry winter and, um, uh,
the question I have for the
sponsor is what is the
senator, uh, the it's so this is
done through our energy minerals
department, and I can't tell you
I don't have an expert sitting
next to me at to exactly how
You know, if there's a committee
or what it is, I just don't have
that answer as I'm standing here
today, so I don't want to.
Go down that path without
knowing exactly what the answer
is.
Uh, fun that's, do we know how
much money is in the fund that
that's at this point.
Senator Wirth, Madam President,
I don't know that um well I
I don't know that um well I
actually I do. Let me see in
the, in the FIR, the bottom of
the FIR, the current balance of
the uh FLRP Forest and Watershed
Restoration Act fund is $5.5
million.
Senator Thornton.
Uh thank you for that. Well, I
think we're gonna try and get
all of that, Madam Madam
soon as possible. So I thank you
and I thank the sponsor for
bringing this forward. I think
this is a very important. I
think New Mexico, we do not want
to end up like California, and I
think this is a a good process
sing nonsen or worth to close.
Madam President, I move that
House Bill 175 do not pass, and
I ask unanimous consent of the

All right, we will move on to

Thank you, Madam President, and
any questions, uh, on the floor.

out there.

Madam President, I yield. He

Madam President, I sensed a
little hesitancy there on the
senator's part, um, but I just
have one question for the
Sur block.

National Guard, Air National
Guard, as well as our reserve

women who do various tasks uh
legislation, um, I am concerned
that uh weirdos like you with
the nuclear codes might have
access, um, more access to our
the sponsor, but I, I do wanna
also stand in support of this
because, um, we know that the
open spaces, uh, in our public
our public lands provide solace,
years because of just the
complete disconnect from any of
the traumas that they have
experienced. And, uh, I used to
be.
one of those public parks, uh,
And many of you may know this is
the, the chipped beef.
And um, it, there's a reason why
it's called SOS.
Madam President, of course, I
would yield to the distinguished
senator from Dona Anna.
So now you can answer her
question, perhaps.
various forms, but it is chipped
beef that you put on toast.
It was gravy and um SOS and I'll
share this offline because it

you have done as a veteran and
uh providing the access for
these day passes.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um, I've

yummy. Thank you. Thank you,
Madam President, and thank you,

Thank you for sharing that, that
nice lovely breakfast menu.
Madam President, I yield.
Senator. So in talking about
your love of avocado toast, do
you also enjoy yoga in parks is
I'd be more than happy to, uh,
answer the senator's question
about my physical fitness or
lack of.
Um, I enjoy some stretches
sometimes.
OK, search time for you, Madam
President. Well, I just heard
the word New Mexican breakfast,
followed by avocado toast. So I
just wanted to kind of expand on

culinary choices that present on
a serious note, Senator, um,
Thank you, Madam President. Uh,
great question, Senator. Thank
you for that. So originally, um,
before this bill, uh, how it
was Senator, with the 50% and
about 100, um, between 141 and
142,000 veterans in the state of
New Mexico.
So Mr. President, Senator, does
this Madam President,
So Senator, so are you saying

so thankfully all veterans and
all New Mexicans have free use
of the parks now under this new
of the year as well, um, Madam
President, I'll just close.
Senator, thank you for carrying
the bill. Um,
We know our outdoor spaces are
places of healing for, for
jewels of the state. So, uh, you
know, I think enabling our
veterans to use them and all New
Mexicans is really an important
thing to do as a policy, and so
it's good to see us kind of
moving that way. So, thank you,
the sponsor would yield for a
couple of questions,
Madam President, absolutely

Block, how, what is the process
for getting into a state park.
you will have an ID card as a
veteran or if you're active duty
reserve or guard, uh, you will
use your, um, military ID, uh,
into the park.
So, Madam President and Senator,
so they just have to present
those forms.
that's active guard or reserve
or a veterans card, and if you
don't have that, you can get
your DD 214 as well.
So Madam President, Senator

present them these forms.
