If our presenters, first
presenters will go ahead and come to the table,
please. Thank
you.
Ok.
Ok. Good morning, everybody.
I think uh committee members
are coming in
slowly. Um
We're going to go ahead and start right on time
this morning. We did establish a
quorum yesterday so we can go ahead and
keep rolling here. We're in the same
meeting.
Um That reminds
me I'll turn my phone down.
Um So all
good. Uh We're going to go
ahead and start with our first item.
Good morning. Thank you for being on
time.
We will wait a couple of minutes.
Representative de La Cruz is going to
tell us the funniest joke he's ever
heard.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. I have an
easy question.
Why did the turtle
cross the
road?
No, not to get to the other
side, Mr
Chairman,
ready to
get to the shell
station.
>> Ok. So we're still waiting for
secretary. So I have a
joke. I tell
this on the floor of the Senate every
year. And for some reason,
Senator Griggs always forgets
this joke that I

>> This
I know.
>> Why did the duck
get thrown out of the
restaurant.
I tell this joke every year on the
Senate form. No,
Senator Pinto. Do you
remember
the duck? Senator Rodriguez?
Do you remember that joke? I tell every year on
the floor. Why did the rest? Why did
the duck get thrown out of the
restaurant?
Mm.
Yeah,
because he couldn't afford his
bill.
Ok, Sabina, you're up
next.
Represents Vice chair
Representative Garrett. You're up next.
We're waiting for your joke of the
day.

whiskey.
>> Yeah.
Anyone

furniture.
I must give credit to
Phelps Anderson for that one.
>> Ok. I'm, I'm sorry, I
got to call foul on the play on that
one. I mean, that's scale
of 1 to 10. That's about a six
representative. All right,
Senator Griggs. Bring it home.
>> What am I doing? >> You're telling us
your funniest
joke.
That is, that is suitable
for public broadcasting. It
is. >> I'll, I'll
tell you one that I
tell my
granddaughters.
It's just a little, it's just
a little ditty.
It says if you're,
if you're kissing with your
honey and
his nose gets kind of runny,
you may think it's
funny, but it's
not.
I,
>> who do we have left
it in the notes? All,
Mark Edwards. You're
up.
All right. Representative De La
Cruz.
>> Did you hear about the guy
that
had somebody ring the
doorbell?
No, I didn't.
Well, this guy hears the
doorbell ring so he goes to the
door, he
opens the door. He looks around, there's
nobody there. He looks down and
there's a snail.
He looks at the snail, he picks
it up and he chucks it across
the street
a year later.
The doorbell
rings.
He opens the door, there's nobody there. He
looks down, there's a snail.
The snail looks up and says,
what the hell was that
about?
>> I'm, I guess I'm a
little tired the day before
fourth. What in the
world?
>> Ok. I'm gonna tell you one more
time. >> Chairman.
The last >> part doorbell
rings guy goes to the
door, sees a snail
picks it up, throws it across
the street a year later.
Doorbell rings.
He looks down, there's the
snail a year later, the
snail looks up and says, what the
hell was that
about?
>> Oh my
gosh.
Ok.
Well, with some of the roads in our
district representative, you and
I, with some of our roads
representative, with
some of our roads. That would be true. It would
take a year to get across those roads,
you know? So,
yeah.
Ok, madam secretary,
are we ready to
go?
>> All right,
>> madam secretary, ready to rock and
roll. Ok. So
here's what we're going to do. Um,
we've had a joke from every member
of the committee this morning.
So now we've got to get your
joke, but you have to turn
on your mic
there.
All right, >> two >> of
them,
>> Mr chair members of the
committee.
Uh,
I'm gonna defer to my
deputy who has a better sense
of humor than I
do.
>> Ok. >> So >> why
did the ghost like
the elevator?
>> Why would your >> nose like
the
other?
That?
So the
more
great
because it lifts his
spirit.
Well, secretary
and secretary and
ready our
better. You're the last
one.
What?
Great
that
and
no,
>> you are not boring. Let me put it that
way. So, uh, but
Senator Pinto, I think has our
last joke of the morning.
>> All right. >> All right.
Senator Pinto going
once.
All right. Well, the tool you need. You're on
the,
there we go. Well, the two
of you on the ends of the table this morning
and I'll come to you later. All right.
Take it away, madam, secretary. We're gonna
start everyone. Uh, I'll bring
your attention to item number seven
report from the Cultural Affairs
Department. Deborah Garcia
Gugo, Secretary, Cultural Affairs
Department, Michelle Gallagher
Roberts, Deputy Secretary, Cultural
Affairs Department.
>> Mr Chair madam, vice chair
members of the committee. Thank you
as always for having us
here for what has become I
think our annual update
on our Cultural Affairs
Facilities Infrastructure
Fund uh with
me today as always
having my back is Deputy
Cabinet Secretary Michelle
Gallagher Roberts. I
also have um
Department of Cultural Affairs,
Co Greg Geissler
and Government Relations
Liaison, Jesse Greenspan
with me today. Um
We distributed the packet
of information in this blue
folder. The presentation
is inside with
a lovely view of the
Coronado historic
site and there's some other
information in the packet for
you including
um a fuller
report of some economic
impact data that I cited my
presentation so that you have
that handy.
Um So
as a reminder,
really the Department of
Cultural Affairs moving to the,
the first page where you
see um a group
of uh parents and
young Children enjoying a
preschool storytime
at the National Hispanic
Cultural Centers
Literary Arts
Center. And then uh
two individuals enjoying
Fort Seldon, and I'm gonna
assume that that picture
was taken sometime in the fall
or winter because you probably wouldn't
wanna be sitting out having a conversation
at Fort Seldon right now. It's probably
100 and 10 degrees out there.
But, um, one of our
beloved sites for
sure, as a
reminder, our mission is
essentially to preserve,
protect and present New
Mexico's unique cultural
heritage for all
New Mexicans with a
specific mandate to educate
the Children of our state.
Um We do that through a
mission and vision that I'm not
gonna belabor. You
have it in front of you if you want to
take a look at it.
Um I wanted to briefly
talk about um
some recent economic
impact data that we
have for the State of New
Mexico every year.
Americans for the arts,
which is a leading
advocate for the nonprofit
cultural sector and arts
education. And full
disclosure, I am on the
board um Every
couple of years, they do a study
called um Arts and
Economic Prosperity.
So they've been doing this study. This
is now their sixth one.
Um And they broadly
collect data about the economic
impact of the nonprofit
arts and cultural sector. So the
data you're looking at is just
nonprofits. What's great
about that is it gives us some
longitudinal data
um to look at changes over
time. And they reached out to
me and said, would New Mexico
like to participate at a statewide
level and we'll waive the
participation fee. So
I said absolutely, a free
economic impact study signed
me up. Now. Um
What we did is get some
really good data. This data
is from 2022.
So it is post
COVID shutdowns. Um
But probably should still be
viewed as in recovery mode.
And you'll note that in New
Mexico, the nonprofit arts
and cultural sector generated
over $740
million in revenue.
It spent over
$267
million In
the local economy, it
supported 4000
313
jobs and it
contributed 4.53
million in state federal
and local tax revenue.
And again, this is just
your nonprofit um
uh sector. It's spending
by those organizations and
their audiences.
Um But I think it's really
important that as much as we
can focus on economic impact,
we all understand that the true
part uh impact of
arts and culture is really
more on um
quality of life and
education and how people
feel and think about themselves and
each others. And so
one little negative data that
I do like to pull out of the study
is that nearly
90% of people who
responded to an intercept
survey at an event
said that the event
or the venue inspires
a sense of pride in
their community. And there's
one thing I know New Mexicans have a
lot of pride in their local
community. So I wasn't all
that surprised that 90% of
them thought that an event happening
in their local community did
that.
Um Moving on
to page four.
Many of you have heard my presentation
before. So this is just a
reminder that the
Department of Cultural Affairs
oversees and maintains its
own facilities while
we enjoy a great working
relationship with
uh GSD, particularly
uh deputy Cabinet Secretary
Anna Silva. And she's
always there to win Lin
a willing hand. As are we
GSD does not actually
take care of our facilities. So we're
one of the few agencies that
oversees our own.
We have over 240
structures
and that includes
um over 100 that are
listed on state and federal
historic registries.
We maintain over 1.3
million square feet of
interior space and over
1000 acres of
property. So
you will see fire mitigation
is an issue that we deal with
often. Um We are
very blessed to
only be in a supporting
role uh at Fort
ST, hosting some firefighters
uh for the, the devastation
that is happening in Rio do
so. Um But it was a
timely reminder
the fire was about 10 miles away
from that historic site. So it's a
timely reminder of why it's really
important that we take fire mitigation
seriously. And we've
been very lucky to get some
congressional delegate um
designated spending for
fire mitigation at Bosque
Redondo, Fort Sumner and Los
Luceros. Um So
that's a great way to leverage some of
this money with some federal
money. Um
We have seven museums
and a cultural center, the National
Hispanic Cultural Center here
today. Uh We
also have um
eight historic sites
from Mesilla all the way up to
call day. And then we have
some support facilities.
The Center for New Mexico
Archaeology located in
Santa Fe and the Stewart
Udall Resource Building in
Santa Fe. So at
uh CN MA, the Center
for New Mexico Archaeology, we
host both the Office of
Archaeological Studies,
but also the
archaeological research
collection, which is the
official state repository
for archaeology in New Mexico.
So we have not only all of
the state's own collection
but anything that's collected off of
state or most federal
properties in New Mexico is
housed there. So it's a really
significant facility that
not a lot of people know about.
And then at Stewart Udall, that's
where we house. Um a
majority of our exhibit
designers. Um
Our facilities bureau is located
there, marketing and communications
and it's the central office
for our historic sites.
Most of these facilities
are highly specialized. They
have particular
requirements around
humidification and temperature
and storage needs to
keep all of the objects
themselves safe.
And if they're not doing
that, then the, the building
or structure itself is historic.
It needs uh specialized
care. And
um according to the last
survey um
by uh the risk
management division, our facilities
and collections are worth, uh about
a billion dollars. But I would
point out that the last time they looked at
that was 2017. So
we've added the bottom contemporary
um along with significant
collections since then. So that
number has probably gone
up.
All of that is to say
um that this
funding is really critical
to maintain these specialized
facilities that house
our cultural
collective, cultural
heritage.
Um I like to
give you an overview
of our facility's funding
needs and where we are
at. So over the
next five years, we
anticipate uh
100 and $24
million in capital
needs. Um We're
realistic about
the likelihood of getting 100 and
$24 million over the
next 45 years. So we
always prioritize,
we are always prepared to
base projects,
um make tough
decisions. But if we were
to sort of take care of everything we
know is on the radar, that would
be the price tag.
Um So for the fy
26 that's
$43.67
million that
we have on, on that
year's um IC
IP um
we are very, very grateful
for the $5 million that was
appropriated in the last session
for the Cultural affairs facilities,
infrastructure fund
out of the public,
private, I'm sorry, public
project revolving fund
um housed it in MS A,
I'm sorry NM fa
um we also
received $5 million
in statewide capital outlay,
appropriations and
8.6
million in individual
capital outlay.
And uh in particular,
legislators really understood
the need for funding to bring
the Taylor Messia
historic site
online. And so
about 3.2 million of that
individual capital was uh
for getting that facility up
to code and open. Uh
Hopefully in the fall. Well,
we have to have it open by
the fall of
2025
and um
small plug on
August 24th in
Messia, we will be opening
uh the first phase of that
project with uh
opening of the Reynolds
Store and an exhibit
and that we'll also be having a really
nice community celebration.
So if you're down in Messia
at that time, please come out
um on Saturday the 24th
and celebrate with us in the
community of
Messia.
Um So the Cultural
Affairs Facilities Infrastructure
Fund was created
in 2020.
Um We managed
the fund and we use
um the fund to repair,
renovate, plan,
engineer and
equip our
facilities and
exhibits across the state.
So really what it is is
basic facilities
funding for our facilities
which um up until
the creation of this fund
minus a small
percentage of GG RT we
had no basic facilities
funding. So, um we're
extremely grateful for this
money. It's been a game changer
um for the department
and it continues to be a critical
source of funding um
for us because without that,
we are relying on capital
funding to take care of all of the
basic operating and maintenance
needs for our
facilities.
Um If you move to
page 20 sorry,
page seven, you'll see some
of the projects that we completed
through um fy
23. I'd like to
help give you a sense of
how our funding is uh
spent and how
it is spent around the state.
So you will see a number
of projects at our historic
sites, Vasca Redondo
Coronado, Fort Zelden and for
Stanton, um along
with Los Luceros,
um we have put a tremendous
amount of money into Fort
Selden over the
past 5.5
years. Um It
is our second highest
expenditure after building
the bottom contemporary.
I'm sorry, Fort Stanton.
Thank you, Michelle.
Um We're at,
what is the number Michelle
seven point
7.2 million.
Um And the vast majority
of that is underground,
we had to put in a new water
system and water treatment
system at Fort
Stanton. Um
But if you go out there, now you'll see
a lot of activity happening
on the nurses corridors,
the laundry's quarters
and um
the main museum building.
Um We also have
undertaken some really basic
work at the Museum of
International Folk Art.
Um The Museum resource
division. This is both at the
Udall building that I
talked about in a smaller
facility we have in downtown
Santa Fe where we actually have a lot
of our fabrication.
People don't realize when they walk
half a half a block off the
plaza that we're actually
doing um fabrication
of exhibits in a really small
building uh
right there on Lincoln
Avenue and then some
additional repairs at Farmer and
Ranch, the History Museum and the
Museum of Art. But if you
go through that list, which you'll really see
is these are very basic
needs that we're using this money
for. Um,
we have, um,
demonstrated, I think over the
past 5.5 years, a
very good capacity
to spend
any type of facility or
capital money that is,
um, appropriated
to us and all of the
appropriations,
um, that have previously begin
given from the
CF have at least
over half of the money committed
or encumbered at this point.
We do keep some of the
money from this fund
in an emergency
reserve. Things happen
every day, um,
around UC A around the
city that need to be taken care
of. And so we do keep a percentage
of this as cash on
hand to deal with those
emergencies. And some
of you may remember that I,
as I sat before this
committee last year, uh,
we actually had a really
um horrific
uh accident at the National
Hispanic Cultural Center where somebody
drove their car into the performing
arts building. So it's
ultimately that was covered
by R MD, but it's really
good to have money for those
unforeseen uh
circumstances.
Um If you
move on to the next page,
you'll see again more
examples of how we spended
um the money
in 2024.
And, um in,
in the category of fire
mitigation, you'll notice that both
Fort Stanton and
the Lincoln historic sites got
zero turn mowers. We
didn't have basic equipment to
mow grass to keep it short to
keep a wildfire from spreading.
Um And it's just an example
of how these are really small amounts.
These are $7000 amounts,
$14,000 total
that this fund provided
that we otherwise really, truly
wouldn't have had the money to buy
this kind of equipment or we would
have been having to use capital and
this is not a capital expense.
This is a maintenance
expense
moving forward to
page. Uh nine and
10. I just wanted to
show you some examples of
how we plan to spend the 5
million um that
was allocated
for
um this
current fiscal year. You'll notice
right at the top of the list
that one um
and a quarter million dollars that
we're keeping in reserve
for emergency repairs.
And then you'll notice an example
of projects around the
state and I don't want to belabor
by taking you through every single
project. Um I think
the list really speaks for
itself. Um But I
would note that on page
10, um
down at Fort Stanton,
you'll notice that there's a very
small amount 25,000
that is a grant for one of
the grant match for
one of those congressional
delegated
designated spendings for
fire mitigation at
that site.
So, um
using that we were able to
leverage
a quarter million.
So it's super helpful to
have this money for that kind of
work. Um
With that, I am happy
to answer questions.
Um
Provide additional information
and I would just note that on the closing
page. Um You have
from left to right, a beautiful
example of the bridge over
the AIA at
um Los Luceros, which
gives you a good sense of why
fire mitigation is an
issue there. Uh
The brand new, beautiful bottom
contemporary downtown
Santa Fe and another
picture from um
Hema which every
year we have to go back out
and do restoration and maintenance
on the Adobe at
Selden
Hema's and Coronado historic
sites that just has to
happen every year over
time, we have to cap
it and keep it. Otherwise,
these beautiful buildings
will simply melt into the earth
because that's what Adobe does if you
don't maintain it on an annual
basis. Thank you,
sir. >> Thank
you, madam secretary madam, Deputy
secretary and thank you so much
for just making our state
a really special place to
be and to visit. And
I think you're doing a great job there. We
do have some questions and I have
just one or two Senator
Griggs. >> Can
you? Thank you Mr
Chair and, and thank you guys for
being here today and, and bringing
some of this stuff up.
Uh Mr Chair.
You know, yesterday, we
had a, we had a
discussion somewhat about
capital outlay. We're
talking about, you know,
how much is out there, how
much, uh, uh,
how, how
other entities tend to believe
that we don't do it the way that
maybe we should.
Uh, but when you look at
this right, right
here, you see
that the request
from, uh, from
cultural affairs is
about one
point or, excuse me, 100 and
$25
million for
year 26.
And that's, that's a
capital outlay
request
when arguably
Mr Chair, that ought to be just
a budget request,
an item in their budget
to maintain their
facilities.
Uh It's not exactly
maintenance but
yet it is a
need for their
facilities for
us to,
to look at that as,
as capital outlay,
which
I think we may need to look
at definitions
and look at how we, how
we address some of this
because they've got a
genuine need. That is
their department's
budget.
We took over the
responsibility of
providing
the
uh the Department of Cultural
Affairs with the facilities. They
need to house the materials
they have. It
shouldn't be
Mr Chair,
a a request for
capital outlay every year. It ought to
be a a
$25
million line item
in their budget every year
for, for capital
projects.
Um
The city of Alamogordo or
Alamogordo, we have
the
uh the Museum of
Space History
and Senator Burt and I
representative
uh block and Representative
Black have
provided dollars
for that facility uh
for years.
Uh I'm sure
they're in Santa
Fe. Senator Rodriguez
and Senator Wirth and,
and a variety of the
representatives. So if they have
spent their capital
allocation on
museums up
there, uh Mr
Chair, I just think as
we go forward
and those of you who may,
you know, who remain on Senate
Finance or
uh, are involved in
appropriations in the House.
This is something I think we
ought to look at and see
if there's a way to
change how
we do business
because these guys,
it's a continual
need for them.
We have a road
fund that is,
that is set up every
year comes out of the
gas tax. But I mean, it's
every year to
help build and
maintain roads. We
don't necessarily have that
same sort of system
for these assets that
they, they have.
So Mr Chair, I wanted to just
bring that up because
it's a,
they're never gonna catch up on
Capitol. A there
needs to be a different
approach. So I would,
I would hope that maybe we could
move forward in doing something
like that. And, and Mr
Chair and, and madam
secretary on, um,
on page six where we
talk about CAFIF
was that?
It seems to me,
Senator Candelaria
years ago
had introduced a
bill that pulls a little
bit of money from
somewhere. It may be
that. And that's all I'm trying to
find out is, is that
where, uh, uh, from
Senator Candela? You're right
there
>> Mr Chair, Senator,
member of the committees.
Yes, this is the bill
that Senator Candelaria
introduced um
that um
pulls money from the
public
project revolving
fund at in
a a the portion that
is not allocated to local
agencies uh
for water projects.
But the portion that the New
Mexico Environment Department
also draws upon for federal
grant matches. This
is that uh Cultural
Affairs Facility, Infrastructure
Fund >> and
Mr Chair and madam secretary. thank
you for that. And that's, that's an
example
of,
of a, of an
individual senator in this
case, finding an
opportunity
to help fund a department
that, that needs some sort
of annual uh
revenue stream.
So, uh
Mr Chair, that's really all I
have. I'm, I'm
hopeful that maybe we can do some
of that because again, as I
said, these guys will
never catch up.
So, thank you, Mr Chair.
>> Thank you, Senator.
And yes, I couldn't agree.
More. Representative, uh Vela
Cruz and I watch over the Hubble
House in our district.
It's uh Gutierrez. Hubble House.
Excuse me. Just a statewide
treasure as well. Uh Representative
Chatfield.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
Uh
Mr Chair. I
just want to say
that I, I agree with
Senator, uh, very
much and I, I think
I serve on the public school
capital Outlay Oversight
Committee. I
serve on the LFC
House Appropriations.
I serve on this committee which
oversees the finance story.
So I, I'm involved
pretty heavily in the finances
at the public school Capital Outlay
Committee. I told
him day before
yesterday, you know,
I routinely
get jumped
by people from my
district to say we applied
for Capital Outlay and you didn't
give us a darn thing. And I
tell them, you know,
capital outlay
is many things.
You know, the public school capital
outlay is not my personal
discretional funds.
Uh,
capital outlay comes right off
the top of the severs tax
bonds,
but there are a variety
of, of
programs that go under
the name Capital Outlet
and I requested and
have been promised a
training
on capital
outlet because I'm
told that they, they are not
equal, they're not the same
programs are not the same
thing. And I think
that, uh,
if it causes confusion
of, for me, when I
serve on all those committees
that deal with that funding,
it is bound to cause
concern with the public
or confusion with the
public. Uh,
I have high hopes
of being trained on
it. I agree with the Senator
that you guys need a line
item for maintenance and not
just, uh, be
every year begging for your
life. I, I have done
that a lot and
it doesn't work very well
because you never know what
you're gonna, you can't make a, a
plan to move forward.
Right. So I agree
with him. My
other question, the
repository where you
keep the
various items that you've
collected from around the state.
Is it a public place
where I can go to the museum
and look at those things because I
like that sort of
thing.
>> Uh Mr Chair,
representative members of the committee.
Yes, you are certainly welcome
to come out to the Center for
New Mexico Archaeology.
Uh We can make an appointment,
Jessie can help you with that and
we can take it through, we can show
you the majority of the
collection uh because
it is uh archaeological.
It's also where we house
human remains. Um
There are certain areas that are
closed to the public and to
researchers. But
um fun fact,
any New Mexican can call
up any of our museums
and make an appointment to go look
at the items in storage
and, and collection. So we would be
happy to arrange that for
you. It's
in Santa Fe, it's on uh
599 as
you head out to like the animal
shelter and the golf course,
um quiet
little facility there just
on its
own.
>> But is it
open to the public every
day? You go through
the
stuff
>> you can come out and you
can certainly go into the building,
visit with any of the staff
there. And um if
they have time to take you through
the collection, they would certainly
be happy to do that. But occasionally
they, you know, it is a pretty
light staff out there. If they
don't have time, they'd be happy to
make an appointment for another
date.
>> Might be third.
Do you
talk about the facility
in Massia? And,
and I, I apologize if
I just didn't hear, but
is that possibly
the J Paul Taylor
home?
And, and is it opening
soon? Did you
say >> I'm sorry,
Mr Chair representative could, I
didn't hear the last part. Is
it, >> uh, the J
Paul Taylor home? I,
I know it was donated
and I got the
wonderful,
wonderfully I got to, to
it, I got to shake J Paul
Taylor's hand uh
before he passed
on and uh it
was when he donated it to the
state. Uh
Is that what the facility
you're talking about? What part of the
facility in Messia?
And will it
open soon for? So
everybody else can get to go through
there and see it. They won't get
medium but, but his
home is awesome.
>> Mr Chair, representative
members of the committee. Yes, it is
the, the former house
and some other buildings owned by
J Paul Taylor and the Taylor
family. They were donated
to the state in
2004. And
the state legislature created
the Taylor Messia historic
site in Statute at that
time. Um
It consists of the house which
is uh you would have met Mr
Taylor likely in the
ground solid towards the
back. So it's the entire
house as well as
the Reynolds and Barillas
Store. So the Reynolds Store
is um pretty iconic on
the Messia Plaza. It's got the 10
front on it and then
the Berea Store is just to the
right. So under
the terms of the agreement, um
the Children had nine months
to do the process that
sadly any of us have to do when
a member of our family passes.
And then after that, we
have two years to open the site
fully for operation. So that
would be November of
2025.
Um What we are doing
in August on the 24th
is opening the rentals store,
which is kind of where people will
go get oriented, get a
tour and there'll be an exhibit
there. And then our plan
is um to have
that our plan and our
requirement is have the entire
house and thea store open
um by the following
fall.
Um And when the house
reopens, it'll look a lot
like it did when Mr Taylor
was there. That was his wish
is that um all
of that incredible collection that
he has be there and be
interpreted as a way of
not just tell, telling the
Taylor family, he and
his wife Mary were very
clear that they really wanted to
use that to tell the
history of Messia
of Southern New Mexico and the
border region and that these
objects were being used for that
purpose. So,
um Deputy
Secretary and I are
in Messia at least once
a month at this point, usually for
almost a full week overseeing
that renovation.
Um It's a difficult
process to take a beloved
family home. Um I think
the tailors were there for 70
plus years and turn
it into a state operated
facility. So there's a lot
of basic life and safety
work that's having to happen
around fire,
electrical upgrades. But
when you go back, it will hopefully
look very much like it was when
you met Mr Taylor
there, >> a
very special man
insisted on not
only coming out
very advanced in age,
came out, shook our hands, but
wanted to sit down for a few
minutes with each of
us and know where we come
from. What we were about.
Quite a guy.
Thank you Mr Chair.
>> Ok. Thank you, Representative
Representative Roal
Caballero.
>> Thank you Mr Chair
and thank you
madam, Secretary and deputy
for your
presentation. I
have first, I want to
say thank
you
in reference to what you
just described is the
process
for rehabbing
and improving
and setting up
the J Paul
Taylor home and
premises.
Um It
saddens me
because Mr Taylor
and my father grew up together
and um
we lost a very dear
friend and for family.
I grew up
in that whole
generation.
And uh in fact,
Mr Taylor was an honorary
pallbearer for my father's
funeral. They were very
close. Anyway,
uh that's going to be a very
special place and I
appreciate the love
and care that you will put
into um
preserving that
property because it's very
meaningful. And
um they were
very um
dedicated to the
history of that
area and I appreciate
that they honoring
my father's tribe
and their presence down there.
So, thank you.
I want to thank Senator
Griggs because
um he brought up a very
important point that I've been bringing
up not only in your
department, but several other
departments that
really need to
have
regular annual
budget items, Mr
Chair.
Um
and not have to be relying
on capital
outlay. So
somehow
we need to be able to stress
that um
so that you can renew
every year
annually. Um
What money
you will be budgeting
yourself for your
needs. That's very
important. Uh
And it also is very important
because it frees
up other
funds to do other
kinds of things, which brings
me to my next point.
You and I have been in
discussion the last few
years
about
Dolores Huerta and
her birthplace in
Dawson, New Mexico
and the difficult
process of
declaring that site a
historical site. I know
it takes several steps.
I was in conversation
with, um I can't,
I didn't bring my notes today
uh with someone from the
National Historic that you all
had referred us to
and it is doable, but
it's a long process.
In the meantime,
after yesterday's
presentation by
Miss Russell from
the uh Finance
Authority and
the various funds
that are available
and financing more than
anything. It raises
a question of how we can
use
our financing
capacity
to make
an offer on that property.
So the first step
that I view,
um Mr
Chair madam Secretary
is the cemeteries
outside of the
property
that we're talking about.
The compound, I call it
compound now of Dawson.
So perhaps we begin
a step by step process.
The cemetery
is very
historical and
that's where Dolores Huerta's
grandparents,
parents, family
members are
all buried
there. She's
our cultural, our living
cultural icon,
internationally
renowned. And
I think we have an obligation
actually more than
anything to
preserve as
much of that property and
historical site.
And so I'd like us to look
at and, and Miss
Russell is here,
um Look at
ways in which we
could put
in an offer that's lucrative
for the owner
that em
embeds in a tax
credit. Uh
All of the possible
incentives
available to
entice
um
the owner, the current
owner
um
to turn that property
over because I think
that would be an
absolute blessing
for the State of New Mexico
because we
drove up there, we got
as far as the
gate
and we, my
husband and I tried
to look in to get as
much of it as possible.
But you have to drive
in about 15, maybe
five miles actually.
And to actually see the
the remains of the
city of the
town. Um
But the cemetery was very,
very emotional
um and very
significant because
of what it exemplifies
for our state.
So the first
question or that is the
question, how do we put
together a package?
Uh And perhaps that might be
the approach that you want to
take as a
second step. First
step, the cemetery
historical site,
second step, acquiring
the property um
to then rehab
it. And the
Dolores Huerta
Foundation.
Mr Chair
madam secretary
would be
absolutely
um
enthusiastic
about helping
with this process. I'm
dedicated to that. I told
her many times
she's looking, I mean, she's
still, she comes
periodically very
often. She, one
of her first stops is to the
cemetery.
And so that's
just incredibly important
for us. So
that's I as a
developer myself
in the nonprofit world,
I think a package could be
put together. I
think that it could be very
lucrative through our
philanthropic
connections
as well as the foundation
and us to
begin that or
to continue. I know
that your office is going to do
a, I forgot what it's
called,
Mr chair,
the Women of, of New
Mexico
Designation. You can speak a
little bit more, but
would you be willing to
pursue it on that
next level?
Mr Chair madam
Secretary,
>> Mr Chair representative
members of the committee.
Um Yes, I'm
absolutely interested in the
conversation. There's
um the Dawson property
related to Dolores
Huerta, her legacy and the larger
conversation. Uh We
have a very similar issue
in Roswell around the
Blackham township
and that history.
Um There are properties
all around the state
that really do deserve
some level of recognition,
recognition and
protection. Um
even if they're not facilities that
are actively owned and
operated by
DC A as a historic
site. And I think there has to be
a way that the state can work
with property owners
to um
entice them to
placing those designations
on at least some of the properties
so that it is noted
and it is cataloged and it can
begin the process of being preserved
and protected. Um
So I would be very interested
both for your specific situation
that I think we've been working on for three
or four years. And it's very
difficult because if you don't have
a property owner that wants to have the
conversation or
respond to the email or doesn't even
understand what you're asking.
The conversation sort of stops
there. I was
recently reading the
history of New Mexico
historic sites, which
became, which previous was
New Mexico monuments and the
history of how that came. And it
was very fascinating. It goes
back to, I think the, the
thirties where the state
land office was
somehow involved. I mean, it's a
very complicated history. So
there's definitely been an
effort on behalf of the state
legislature in the State of New
Mexico at large
to identify these properties
and try to put them in some form of
protection. And I think,
although there was definitely
a reason that model was moved
away from, and we now end up with
the, you know, the, the 78
historic sites that we have,
it's probably worth looking
back and seeing
how that was handled
and why and then working with
Marquita, the State Land Office,
private funders and others to
figure out how you could
incentivize a property owner
to even designate a portion
of their property even if they're not
interested. Um and
getting rid of the property
at large. I think there's also
some models in um
conservation easements
that could be used. Oh, there's another
very contemporary piece that there's a
lot of private interest in,
in uh San Miguel County
called San Star
Axis. Um that a lot of
people are very interested in finding
some way to preserve and protect. That's a
contemporary land art piece.
So um
yes, I'm I'm happy and I
will um through Jessie, we will
definitely follow up with
our colleague uh Marquita
Russell as well as with you
on that issue. >> And so just
to jump in there, representative, pardon
me, on that point, we have
Representative Chatfield.
Is it on that point? I, I thought you had
a contribution
here.
>> I think it would be on that
point. But what what as
to whatever it is? Thank you, Mr
Mr Chair. Uh You
know, one of the great things about
being a watershed
project manager and being
able to go back and restore our
watersheds is getting to see
a lot of properties that
might be not available
to other people. And
uh I have been to
Dawson many
times worked there.
Uh
It Dawson is no longer
there. They moved
the homes out to
Raton they moved
the homes to,
uh, I know a
lot of them went to Raton. I think
there are a few went to Clayton.
So it, it doesn't
exist. The, the graveyard
actually is in good
repair and a good history there
about the baseball team and all that
stuff. There's one house
and one little barn that,
that are left there at
Dawson.
Uh,
but the, there is
no city,
no town or no
remains of it.
Uh And it, it
is a part of a
property that
is on a property that
had coal, the coal
mines on it, of course.
And uh it's
gone, but
it's a beautiful area.
Very pretty
area and no homes
left.
Thank you. >> Thank you, Representative
Representative Roy. Well,
thank >> you. And
recently, well,
I don't know how recent when we
began this
I attained
and, and I have it on,
on my, one of my
emails. There is a
group that
meets,
um, do you remember
their names? Um
Madam Secretary that
meets annually there in
September. >> Uh
Mr Chair, representative
members of the committee, I don't
remember that
particular group.
I know that we did talk
about um
the women's history marker
program and getting the
marker um in a
location that was a little bit closer
to the site. The same thing is true
of blocked, which is also true. There's
nothing, there's nothing left
in blocked them to look at. There's one
remaining house that has been moved off
the site. Um I
know that we talked about that
as a possibility. And so
that's where I think there
has to be a middle ground between
operating something as a historic
site, especially when there is
history in the place. But the
build environment has
changed. There has to
be a middle ground between a full
historic site and a designation
that says there were people
who lived here, there was a
community that was here.
There was a significant narrative
that happened here and it is no
longer here, but we still recognize
this occurred and honor that
history. Um
But no, I'm sorry, I don't remember the
name of the group that meets annually.
>> So they sent me an
aerial.
Um When
I began the inquiry,
the details of the inquiry, they
sent me the name of the mining
company that bought out
the property that still
retains ownership.
They gave me all the details
they meet there annually.
Um in
September, I believe
as just a gathering
of the families
and generations that have
tried to retain that
area and,
and, and call
attention to it, but it's more of a,
just a gathering that
they have there just to honor
the site and the,
the um
the
um
generations that came
after that. So
the idea was not
to actually create
a museum type
or, but to
pre going along the
mission of this
office to protect
and preserve
the history.
So even if you do
a inter
graded
walk through
that. Any,
anything of that nature
where, where it designates.
This is the site of
this, this is the site of
that. It, it's
just little
markers. Uh but
the, it has to be in
steps. Uh representative.
You're correct. I
believe I saw
three structures
um in
the aerial that they gave
me. I don't know what they represent.
I don't know if their
houses or what those structures
were because this was
a full city
with a hospital, with
home schools,
the whole works that you know,
they had their whole full
operation. So,
um Mr Chair and
madam secretary,
um you're correct. What
we want to do is just
create and, and preserve
and protect it and
that's what's really important
and you're right about it being
similar to the Roswell
property as well
because that I've been familiar with
that. So that's where
I'm headed with that. And if we
can uh prepare
a package, but the big
key is if anyone
here or
in our legislative
body, no,
maintains
ongoing contact with the
mining
industry that
could help us
facilitate acquiring
that property, that
would be really key
because it takes
always someone who knows
someone
to be able to open
the door and once the
door is open, then a package
can be, I think we
can put together a beautiful
um package between
all the parties involved.
Anyway, that um
Mr Chair and madam
Secretary wanted to just bring
that to light and
request. Keep it in mind
anybody who has any
contacts with that
industry or knows
of anyone that we can
make that contact and
begin the that particular
process. And thank you for doing
the women's history
plaque because that's really going
to be
beautiful and
a major first step, ok.
Thank you, Mr Chair and
thank you madam secretary. >> Thank you
representative and excellent,
very salient points there.
We need to be
thinking about how to get this thing to on
that point though, before we move on,
Representative de
>> Larez,
thank you, Mr Chairman
uh Representative
Cerro Royal. I'm
I'm happy to hear that
there are folks that meet out there
annually in a in a I
guess uh just
speculating to
recognize the, the
efforts and,
and the importance of
Dolores Huerta and her
efforts with her partner
uh Cesar
Chavez.
I, I just want to
share that. I think it's important.
I was just talking to Representative
Garrett that we have
minimally some
state marker that
designates that because the
effort that was undertaken
successfully by,
by both uh
Cesar Chavez and
Dolores Huerta uh
impacted farmworkers
across the entire country while
it took place. The efforts took place
in California. It
affected all farmworkers
across the country as a child.
My father would take my sisters
and I down to,
to a little town uh
southern New Mexico called
Rincon, which is just
south of
hatch. And we
would pick onions
and it was a way of supplementing
the income for our family because we
were a large family. We were
total of 11 kids.
My father was a construction
worker and, and uh
funding for the family would,
didn't come easy. And so summers
were important to
supplement that income.
And I will share with you
that in the 19 sixties when we
were doing that about the middle
sixties,
uh
there was, there was no
effort to help farmworkers
outside of the pay that they
got for their
work, for their effort and we would
pick onions. And so
there were no bathroom facilities,
there were no shade facilities,
there was no water,
you had to bring everything with
you. And if you needed the bathroom, you
scrambled into the, any
place that you could find some
semblance of privacy
for even a basic
necessity as a bathroom.
And so when we
talk about what that meant
to farmworkers
having done that work as a
child, those
efforts that were undertaken in
California that ultimately
resulted in changes across the
nation are simply
important. And I just feel that a New
Mexican uh although
no longer residing in New
Mexican uh
did that. And I think
it's important to recognize
that uh
lastly, I'll say, and I'm I'm
actually proud of this, Mr Chairman.
Uh
I was in Washington DC
at the National Museum of
Portraiture and painting
and they had a
hallway dedicated to the
farmworkers. And there was lots
and lots of images, big large
poster size images
of that effort in
California between those two
individuals that I mentioned.
But one of the prominent pictures
had Dolores Huerta in,
in an iconic
photo of her holding up
a sign that says Wega
which means strike.
And
it occurred to me that
how can it be
that such a
renowned New
Mexican had
absolutely not a single
facility
road, anything named
after her. So
I determined when I got
back to Albuquerque Mr chairman,
that we would change
that in the South Valley.
And so we
dedicated a park
while I was on the County Commission,
we dedicated a park after
Dolores Huerta,
that is now called Dolores Huerta
Gateway Park Park. And
that's the first
recognition of her
efforts. And
she was there for the
dedication.
And uh it was, it was a
great day for the entire community,
Children read poems and it
was just wonderful. I don't know if you were there,
Mr Chairman.
Uh but I just think it's
important that the birthplace
of this individual has to
be recognized
minimally with a, a state
marker that designates
it. Sorry for
getting on a high horse, Mr Chairman,
>> Mr Chair May I
>> It's,
>> yes, thank you.
Um You know, thank
you, Representative de La
Cruz. Uh
One of my biggest pride and
joys was
not only the park and I
was unfortunately unable
in not out of town for that,
but for the streets, the,
the boulevard, the boulevard's
being named.
And um
that's very important
as you stated in
your history. That's one of the
reasons why I became a
community and labor
organizer. It was
because of
working. I, I
was a youth organizer
sent to the camps
in California to
train and I
trained with
Cesar Chavez and Dolores
Huerta.
That's an incredible
history. Um
We were in
California recently
and my son treated my
husband and I
um to
visit the Chi
Marine
Chicano
Museum
and
to, to be
living
a living
person
involved in that
movement
in seeing
what I was involved
in and all of the
people that I
associated
with was
an incredible honor.
And I never
felt
um what's the word
that, that I
would see that day
that you can see your
efforts?
Um And
so what he did for
Riverside California
uh Cheech Marin
was an incredible
contribution and you're
correct, the
birthplace must be
honored. She
is
what I mentioned, my
husband has scars
still on his back from
working the fields
as a young person, as
you uh
farmworkers and the
work of the farmworkers
goes by far
underrecognizing
the food we eat, we should
dedicate everything we
do every time we put
something in our mouth and go to the
grocery store to the
hard work that
the generations of farmworkers
have done and continue to
do in this
state. There was an effort,
Mr Chair to
deny
farmworkers
workman's comp in
this state. We had to fight
that. Remember we had
to fight that.
So these are the
kinds of institutional
um
racist practices
that we need to
overturn so
that we can then
honor
appropriately. So
I agree with you,
Representative De La
Cruz very
much in my
life. I'd like to
see
that
fulfilled and that's
why I brought it up to
this committee because that's so very
important. Thank you
for allowing
me. >> Thank you. Thank you,
Representative Aral Cerro. Thank you,
Representative Delacruz. I'm
gonna go to Senator Rodriguez
now.
>> Thank you Mr Chairman. Good
morning to our
secretary and
deputy and staff.
Thank you for all your work
as always.
Um You know, I, I
find it sad, Mr
Chairman that we have
the staff taking from their
day every year
to come before us more than
once. This is only one
committee. They have to go before
LFC. And I don't know how many
others to request
funding for something that we
all know
has to be done
consistently. We have to
fund these museums and
all these state historic
sites and
we still require the staff
to take off from their
duties every day,
big job and
make trips and take a whole day
coming to request funding from
the legislature
just to get partial
funding and not what
they need, which means
it's adding to
the stack of the
deficit that we have
for next year and next year.
But that being said, I think
I'm preaching to the choir here,
but I do have a
potential option that
may work.
And of course, Marquita can
wave at me and stop me as we're going
if I'm overstepping my
bounds because again,
again, it's administered
by the MNM FA
here. But
in our quest to provide
consistent funding for
the future uh
and have a, a
vehicle by which we
can consistently
put funding into for
these museums. And the Cultural
Affairs Department, we
already do have a
vehicle. We
have the facilities
infrastructure fund, which
is where you got and it's in this
sheet of paper. Um
you have $5
million that
comes to you
every year, but not
exactly 5 million every
year. It's not something we
can have. The department
depend on because it
fluctuates. It
comes from the
local government planning
fund because
of a, it,
it's the
legislature provided
for that. But there's never,
there never has been anything
very, very
serious in statute.
It's kind of been like a
handshake is what
I understand for this.
And so $5
million gets appropriated
from the Cultural
Affairs and Infrastructure
fund from the
or through the N MA
that being said,
um because
it comes from the local government
planning fund which also
gets impacted
by the P
pr F, the public project
revolving fund on
amounts and so on.
It's hard for the department.
It's difficult for the department
to really depend
on this money even
if they could. Here's my
point finally is
that um
$5 million is not
nearly enough as we
know. And so
one potential
solution can be
that since
the vehicle is already there, this
facilities infrastructure
fund that perhaps
we can remove
by statute. Of course, clear
statute also for Marquita
to know what the legislature
really is going to appropriate
every year as she administers
the, the program.
Um perhaps
the legislature can
um do an
influx of funding
already into this vehicle,
the infrastructure fund. And if
need be, we would
have to amend the
language to
accommodate the new
money so
that we know
that it's not going to
wipe out the 5
million that comes in as it is
today. But that
it would add language
to basically remove
the limitations is what I have
written down here on
the and
also new language
that would accommodate
the influx of money coming
in directly from the
legislature and not
specifically just
from the, from
the local government planning
Fund, which is so uncertain.
So I thought we
don't need to establish a vehicle,
it's here and just amend the
language how we do it. But
one thing does have to be for
sure is that the
legislature
in doing this has
to be committed to providing the
funding for
this because
we don't want to have language
in here requiring
so much money to come in through
the N MA
and yet no funding
available to distribute
it. We find ourselves
in that predicament many
times. So I just
wanted to bring that up, Mr Chairman
as we know, I, I won't be here in
January. Um,
but I, because of my
retirement as you all know,
but I thought this may be
something to look at and
Marquita would weigh in
on this and see if that would work
or not. And as always,
we appreciate that.
>> All right. Thank you very much, Senator. And I know
we have a lot for you to do. Don't
worry,
I don't know if Marti want
to weigh in for a couple of seconds. >> Is that
something that would work Marquita
or do you have anything
else that I can add or take
from what I said,
>> Mr Chairman, uh,
annually, we put forth a, a
bill that Senator
Rodriguez, uh, mentions
that moves money from one fund
to a number of other funds.
Um, and that's about $13
million that comes from the public project
revolving fund over
to, um, several different
funds including the local
government planning fund, which you're about to hear
about and the cultural
affairs. That's a fixed amount of
money from the, and
that's an annual bill that comes
through to you. So you can't
really earmark that because
it is subject to annual
appropriation. I think
what I'm hearing the Senator
talk about is perhaps getting some
sort of earmark that
can go directly from the state
into that fund so that it's not
subject to the annual appropriation
process. And of course,
anything we can do to help support that
would be, you know, we'd
be there. >> Excellent.
Thank you very much, madam
Secretary. Did you want to comment at
all? >> Yes,
Mr Chair, Senator,
members of the committee.
Yeah, I'm, I'm happy to
explore that with Marquita and
see if there's a mechanism for that.
And I do want to want to say that
Marquita and her staff have been
nothing but
helpful and collegial
and great partners in this and
we're deeply appreciative to
her and her staff.
So I have no doubt if there's a
possibility she will help
us find it. Thank you.
>> All right. Thank you, madam secretary. Thank you
Marqui and thank you Senator. One
more comment there. >> Minor
Mr Chairman and thank you Marquita
for, for that. I
was thinking that in the bill and I think
I carried the bill, moving that
funding, moving some
funding from the P Pr F
into, into these
other funds because we
match or we get match from the
federal government. So we
move them to leverage that
dollar. Um And
so I'm happy
that you brought that up, Marqui
and hopefully we can do
something a little bit out of the
box here and get some money.
Finally you can depend on.
Thank you. >> Thank
you, Senator. Now we'll go to Representative
Terrazas,
Mr Chairman. I had nothing >> else to
write.
I was yielding to the
gentleman.
Ok. Thank
you, Mr Chairman. Uh
And uh
thank you uh Secretary
Grego and Deputy Secretary
Roberts. Um By
the way, thank you for the lapel pin.
Um There's a lot that was
just said. Here's, I think it's a
great conversation.
Um A few things,
obviously capital outlay. I'm
just gonna briefly go over these
things uh
uh to just put
my two cents in Mr
Chairman um
in Cap Outley, we're
blessed to have
um Priscilla Lucero
and the cog and
we have and this is an
educational thing that we do for our
community and let them
participate where
we have one day that's set
for all the representatives and senators
to sit and get presented
the entire day sponsored
by Western New Mexico
University and
allows the community to come and listen
to what the projects that are
being um their high,
the priorities of each
entity and the
presentations to us
so that they can see uh
what projects are, are needed
in our area. And grant counties
is, you know, for instance,
and the
prospectors are a big part of
that.
It's interesting that
in just silver in the
grant county area,
there's $100 million
in asks
and when you have
three different counties in
your district,
and we look at the capital
outlet that we have, especially in
rural, in our rural
districts.
You see, you've got a dollar
for basically
$100 of asks, right?
$100 million we've got maybe a dollar
a million for to
meet that. Um,
beyond that, that doesn't
even include what
the governor's priorities
are in our area. So
if you really put it all
together is probably
more like 25
cents. And so
it's a good way for us to show
the citizens of our district,
the, the constituents of our
district, what
the, what really, how hard
it really is to pick and
choose. What are the priorities
in your, in your district and why
you're funding them and so forth.
So I'll, I'll leave it at
that. And I think it's just a, I think
it, if, if some of my
colleagues get a chance
and I'm not sure how you do it
in, in the more urban districts
because I mean, you have so many more projects
and let's just say Albuquerque
and how that would be divided. But
I think it would be good to
model something like that maybe in your
districts. The second thing
I wanted to, to mention is I'm
and I'm glad some of your colleagues like the
uh Mr dcruz representative
dcruz mentioned
uh you know, farmworkers
and how he himself
worked fields. My, my father, I'm a firstborn
American here. Also, my dad
worked those fields right next
to Rinco in Hatch, which was my
old part of my old district.
And, and so I'm very
well aware of that area and I know it
really well and
you know, we think of our farmworkers
and I know a lot of the farmers, there are
agricultural people
that, that are working
and are struggling
to get enough workers
um through those h to a
programs and so forth.
It's just not, it, it's a lot
of struggle to get enough people
to, to pick the crops
that are ready for harvest and so
forth. Um
The biggest
issue that I see
right now or one of the biggest
issues I shouldn't say the biggest, the,
one of the biggest issues that I'd like to bring
up to my colleagues is
we need to work on legislation
for temporary housing.
If you absolutely look
at the, at the, at the uh
statute, it
doesn't address temporary
housing. And
so if you're, you're in a
county and you're just
going off the books.
They're basically in violation
when you have farmworkers living in a
multi, in a,
basically have a multifamily
dwelling in, in
something that's set up for
farmworkers. And that's a
big problem. It is
in Donan. Uh,
I know that there's some issues. So
it's something that I think this,
I, I just want to bring that up since
it was brought up. I think we,
we should uh work
together in putting some
legislation to just
address that. Like all of our
neighboring states have done,
we're, we just haven't done it.
And so I, I just
want to mention that the
other thing is
is when we're talking
about fire mitigation, thinning
and so forth.
Uh Mr Chair uh
madam Secretary and deputy
secretary. We
have the in, in just
my district alone. We
have 100
100 sections,
possibly
more
of, of
projects or of an area
that's been I, I guess
let me put it this way of
area that has been
diag uh uh targeted
as a
fire barrier that
we need to put, right, a thinning
barrier.
And one
section for those of you who don't know how, how
many acres in a section are
640 acres
in a section. So
that's 640,000
acres that need to be
uh thinned.
It's very easy for some of us
to see our, you
know, at first it was Las
Vegas
now, Rio Oso, I
live in Silver City. I could
very easily remove
uh Riodosa
headlines uh
in the news and replace Silver
City very
easily. The Mimbs, the
whatever
and Pinos
Saltos uh in some of these
Glenwood and some of these towns
very easily and see
the same thing happening
there. And then we go beyond
that and after we go
through a fire,
um then we're dealing with the
flooding, right?
So we think about it, we
think about this as, as representatives
and senators sitting here today
and wanting to pick and
choose. Are we going to
work
in prevention
on prevention
and, and rather
than all of
a sudden midi mitigating
the the the right
re restructuring and
rebuilding and so
forth. And
so I look at my, my, my
colleague, my good friend, uh
representative Harlan
and all of a sudden the next 10
years, he will be
literally working
on repairing
the damage that was
caused when they
had 20 years.
They knew for 20 years
that this was a fire hazard
they knew was happening.
And do you know what the some of the
the biggest problem is for
these, all these acres? What,
what the problems they've been
diagnosed? The funding is
there, everything's
there, the
archaeological surveys
are lacking.
So that is the, that's
the bottleneck.
We only have a handful of
archaeologists
and they're, and they're busy,
you know, you can call them and,
and they're busy on fif
1500 acres here.
They're busy for two and three
years. And so there's,
there's programs out there.
My understanding is
talking to people from the soil
and water conservation that
they, we can get
archaeologists
and we can
have a 40 I think it's a
40 hour and please correct
me. I mean, I don't have the, this isn't
perfect. I may be off
on a few of these statistics,
but I
believe that they take a course for
40 hours,
think of them as
apprentices that
work under this
particular archaeologist.
And then they go and they, they spread
out and survey these areas
and protect our and
open that gate so that we
can then start thinning and so
forth. Right.
Um I think it's very
important for us as, as,
as, as the
legislature
and to, and
to seriously
take that into consideration
because Silver City
isn't the only one
we can just see us falling and
how, who's next,
who's next on that? Who's gonna
be on, on the news next.
And you know, we talk about
the important sites that you
have that, that very
important. Right. And it's
very easily,
we can see how
easily one of those can
get wiped out. We
also have to educate
the public in
their responsibility
as private owners
to thin a
barrier around their
home.
Now, then
we run into other problems,
uh Mr Chair
where possibly
that particular individual
may not have the funds or the
means
physically to within that
area. And so,
but there are other pro there are
other funding sources
that are out there that we haven't
educated our public in knowing
that they can get. I
and I'm and I don't,
I'm not sure if I should, if
this is exactly accurate,
but I believe Mr Chair
that we could possibly
use some of the money out of the legacy
fund to
protect some of
these areas.
And I, I think it's, it's
just very important.
Um
I was just looking at my notes
here making sure I here's the
other thing that we have, we have
volunteer fire departments
all over
the median age in my area
in my district, 70
years old.
And so we, we've got to
take into consideration
can we as a
state
possibly fund permanent
positions in some of these
places and
have some sort of incentive
programs to become a
firefighter whether
and, and here's the thing,
um Mr Chair,
you don't have to fund it
upfront. I think Mr
Chair, if we considered
having some sort of,
uh,
a tax
credit of some
sort just for participating
and working so many hours
as a volunteer where
we get it on the back end rather than
hitting us, you know,
out of the checkbook
immediately, we could sit
there and we could possibly give people
some credits so that they maybe
give them some incentives to do
that. I just
um Mr Chair, I it's,
it's a very, very serious
thing. I think that's one of the
biggest
problems that, that, that
faces New Mexico as
wildfires.
Um
that if you just start, keep
going down the, down the,
the, the
uh down that
direction, what does it do
after the fire? We get the flooding,
after the flooding, we get
our, our water gets
destroyed, right.
So we have a lot
of problems with
that and
respectfully, I'm gonna
say Mr Chair,
we have some groups
that come out and
with good intentions
of protecting uh
habitat
have intentions
of, of, of
protecting. Let's just say we,
we'll say this, I don't
know, an owl or
whatever species,
but
inadvertently, they're
slowing down these
projects that are ready to
be thinned. And
I'm, I, I wonder Mr
Chair if
we could rethink that
and see what happened
today, if
we look at those groups would
reconsider their
lawsuits in
the slowdown of,
of, of these projects
because of the loss of
wildlife, the massive
loss, loss of wildlife,
people's personal
livestock, their
pets and
human life and, and,
and then last of course, property
damage. So I just think
it's, it's something that I just wanted to
voice. I think it's very important
for us to really consider
that and not
be at odds
but come together and really
see how we
together can,
can work together to protect
the, all, all of our communities
from, from this. And I,
I didn't have many questions.
It was more of a of a
I need to unload that because
I just think that is a major
problem for New Mexico. Thank you, Mr
Chair. >> Thank you, Representative
madam Secretary. Would you like to comment
briefly on those
comments? >> Yes,
Mr Chair, representative
members of the committee.
Um I think it's um
I would, I would have two
responses or, or
additions to what you say. I think the
role that our sites play
in and the role and the responsibility
that some of our sites have in
clearing those areas,
keeping them safe, preventing
fire, you know, fires on
our own property is critical and I'm
really glad that our congratu
delegation has stepped forward and provided
that funding and that this funding
is available to
um leverage that
because the other thing was
we have seen at Fort Stanton, Los
Luceros and actually at the
National Hispanic Cultural Center
is those firefighters do
need our facilities for
staging. I mean, we have
firefighters camped out at
Fort Stanton right now and we've
had that at the other site. So
we do have a role in this and
I appreciate your stressing the
importance. Um
We also have a volunteer fire department
located on Fort Stanton.
So we, this is a
conversation which we are very much a
part of, I agree with
you on that. The archaeology
and I would just add from the arch
office of Archaeological Studies
standpoint, we are often
called upon by other state agencies
in particular to perform those
required surveys.
Um And it is very
hard right now to hire
archaeologists. It is a field
that is understaffed.
And so I will um speak
with John Taylor Montoya about
the the possibility of
internships. I
do um we work
on a fee basis because
oftentimes with federal agencies,
there is a considerable amount of money to
pay for our time.
But um I I
have asked in the
past and will likely be
asking again for some base
funding for General Fund
archaeologist at the Office
of Archaeological Studies
so that we can hire those
permitted archaeologist
to then oversee those
apprentices. We need the
capacity to hire them up from
the General fund and then collect
the fees on the backside. So
those were the two salient
points >> I have. Thank
you, madam secretary. Thank
you representative. And I, as I
understand the Legacy Fund
representative, I do believe there's
an application here. So we should explore that
and find out madam Vice
Chair, Representative
Gert. >> Thank you Mr
Chair and, and thank you everybody
this,
we're getting more than we even
realized from your presentation.
Uh I want to thank you madam
secretary for including the names
and emails of your staff.
I've told L CS 1000
times, make sure presenters do
that. You'd be surprised how
many people don't. So we
know how to get a hold of you. Thanks
for the gorgeous Pin
uh Mr
chair. Thank you, Senator
Griggs. Some of us are meeting about
capital outlay changes
Senator Griggs. If we make
a task force, you're
gonna, it's gonna be a
job for you in the new
year. So
watch out. Uh I
also want to say many of us
didn't eat grapes for years.
Uh When we could eat grapes
again, I
really appreciate grapes.
And then, and I hope you're getting
the money for the custodial
services for all those
sites. And then
my real question is
I was uh recently
contacted by a member
of and this has to do with
some of these historical
issues. Uh
The Korean American Chamber of
Commerce
because Ring Cone
where Representative
Art De La Cruz once
picked onions is one of the first
places where Chinese and Korean
people bought land.
The railroad sold
plots of land to Chinese
and Korean workers
who knew there is still
a Korea street in
Rincon.
And so my
contact who visited
me last week uh
wanted to know how
do we, what's the
process to get a historical
marker?
And we've been talking about historical moments.
How do we, who do we contact?
Is it your office? Is it
Tourism? Who, what, how,
why >> uh madam
chair uh I'm sorry, Mr Chair
madam, vice chair members of the
committee. Um The
Historic Workers Program is a
collaboration between the
historic preservation division
of my agency and the
Department of Transportation.
And um Jesse
Greenspan can get you
a specific person that
could contact be
contacted. There is an application
process, it goes to
the Cultural Properties Review
Committee for approval
and then dot dot is the one that
actually
identifies the right away and
puts up the sign
>> and Jessie's sitting >> right back
Greenspan is right there and she
will follow up with you,
>> ok? Because this person
now they're talking about making
a garden.
So can private funds,
Mr Chair be
contributed
when groups who
deeply care about these
things have
some
uh
suggestions that really go
beyond
current funding
and they is there a
mechanism for there to give
money?
>> So Mr Chair madam, vice
chair members of the committee,
um We work with the ot
because we place it on a very
small portion of their right away.
So property to do
a project that expands beyond that
to be a garden uh would
very much be a private um
undertaking and that can
certainly happen just depending
on the adjoining property owner.
And we're always of course happy
to talk to dot
About that as you have
heard in regards to
both um uh
Dolores Huerta, as well
as Blackham oftentimes
dot is unable to put
the marker where they
logically make sense
because if they don't have
rightway near that site,
they get it as close as they
can, but sometimes it
just causes confusion.
So I think that is part
of the larger conversation
that it sounds like needs to be had
about how we designate
spaces and create
opportunities for communities
to tell their history
in a way that
doesn't necessarily require a lot
of land acquisition. So I
think the larger
conversation that this group has
is akin to larger conversations
that other groups want to have. And we need
to find a mechanism
for designating a
place
beyond, you know,
running it as a historic
site.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. I believe the
gentleman contacted me, actually
owns land as far
as the garden goes.
So, ok, thank you. Very
clear, very helpful.
That's my questions.
>> Thank you madam, vice chair and thank
you secretary. I think
that's all of our questions and
I will say Representative
Terrazas and uh
represent de la Cruz. Well,
I didn't pick onions in the
Ricco. I did
live in T or C for two
summers in a foster home and we
picked onions in a neighboring
community every summer and
a lot of them in dairy and
array. Does that sound familiar? Is
that just down the road from there? Right?
OK. There you go.
Um So that being said,
we got a little kinship here and a lot of
connection, right? Uh
madam secretary,
just a real quick question.
Excellent. I agree with the vice
chair that a lot more came out of this
presentation that even I thought we were gonna get.
So, thank you very much. You're
probably like, whoa,
what happened here? I
just showed up to talk
about,
walked out of here with, you're
gonna have to go from here to set up some
markers. That's right.
So if you go to slide nine of
your presentation, I just want to ask a
quick question the top of slide nine
where it says DC statewide
Statewide Emergency repairs
1.25 mil is
that a fund that gets
invested? And there's a spin-off
like we do with our other funds or
is that you're going
to draw that down until it's
gone? >> Mr
Chair members of the committee that is
an amount we hold in
the, the Cultural
Affairs Facilities Infrastructure
Fund for expenditure
when an emergency
arises. Michelle
internally authorizes the
draw from that held
amount obviously
working oldest to newest money
first. >> So there is
a that will eventually
disappear that, that well,
I mean, I guess
where I'm going with my comments
is you bring
and I'd be happy to carry it for you if you're
willing if you want to do this, I don't
know why we wouldn't just turn that
into
AAA an invested fund.
That's an endowment that spins
off with the prudent investor rule of
5%. And then it just grows
from here to kingdom come as
we've seen in a lot of our funds. Is
that something you'd consider you'd want
to do? Now, at the current rate, I
think you'd have about, what
would that be? 62 5 or
something that would come out of it
every year at a 5%
drawdown
that way it doesn't go away.
>> Yeah, Mr Chair members of the
committee, I appreciate that
very much. Thank you. And I would love
to visit with you about how we
could find solutions to
kind of a lot of the issues we've
talked about and I appreciate
Senator Rodriguez
pointing out there is already
a fund that could be held, there could be
some other amount. So I would love to have
that conversation. I'll follow up with
you next week.
Appreciate >> it. Thank you madam,
chair madam, vice chair. I'm sorry, madam
secretary madam, deputy secretary,
all the roles
here. I really
would hate that. That's a substantial
amount that we are that you
have there. I don't know why we
wouldn't turn that into something that spins
off an amount every year and then
grows over time. All
right. Well, that's all I have. Thank you so
much. Thank you to the committee. Very, very
good and robust conversation.
Thank you for your time this >> morning. Thank
you, Mr, chair members of the committee.
I think this conversation has
been
illustrative of
all of the pots that
this agency has its fingers
in that many people don't
appreciate. So I think
>> you. I'm so glad
you were here today and thank you again
for this pin. We receive
a lot of pins and I really
particularly like this one. Thank you.
Put it on right away. All right.
Thank you so much. I'll ask the
next presenters to come to the
table and I'll draw
the committee's attention to item
number eight. We're about
nine minutes behind schedule. So we're
doing actually pretty good by
legislative standards.
Um report from the New
Mexico Renewable Energy Transmission
Authority. Rita Lynn
E Mosler. I hope I said
that right.
Close enough. All right, you
should, you should be a Padilla east of
New Mexico and hear all sorts of
pronunciations. Executive
director, Rita Mariposa
Padilla Sage, general counsel,
Rita, I'll ask you to take the
table
and begin whenever you're ready.
We do have your presentation
here that was just given to all of
us. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Chair Paia. Does it sound working
now? Ok. Thank
you. Um I've
got one more handout. It was
a little bit of an afterthought this
morning and we don't quite have enough, but
it's a supplement to the
materials we've handed out already.
It's a economic
study on the, one of our
projects, the Rio Soul
Project. So
those uh
Eric
uh
albo my uh deputy
director is passing those out. So
let me get started. Uh Good morning.
My name is Lynn Masal.
I'm the new Executive
Director for the New Mexico Renewable
Energy Transmission
Authority. Uh
I've been their general counsel,
so I'm not new to Rita,
but I am new in this
role. And uh seated
beside me is
Marlos Bedia Civic.
She's
a lawyer at Sutton, the and
Brown, my former employer and
she's worked quite a bit on the
Rita uh account
and is moving into the general Council
role. So she's also not
new to Rita but new to the
general Council
role
this morning, we were just here to
see you in, in October.
So a little
over half a, a year.
Um So I have labeled this
an interim report because we
have a ways to go uh
until our, our annual
report is usually due December
1st. Um
So uh consider
this an interim report and I I'm
gonna try to just highlight
the uh
um
events that have occurred
since October.
Rita was formed in
2007
to facilitate the development
of high voltage
transmission and
storage projects
to assist
with further development of New
Mexico's renewable
energy resources.
And uh as you'll
see in the rest
of my presentation,
New Mexico has
really tremendous
wind and solar resources.
And the one
or the most significant
hurdle to
development of that resource is
the lack of transmission
capacity both
on the New Mexico grid.
And also getting
to
the location
of those resources
which are typically not
located in the population
centers where the grid is
located.
So we have right
now uh Rita
has one project
in operation
that's the Western Spirit
Project. Uh And
we have four other
projects in what we
call acquisition lease back
arrangements. That's
Sunia uh Rio
Soul, the
Lucky Corridor Mora
Transmission Line and
the North Path transmission line.
And I'll, I'll get into detail
on each one of these in a little bit.
Uh And then since
October, uh we've
entered into two new mo
us with
uh the
uh nextar energy who
is developing the Crossroads
Hobbs Roadrunner project down in
the southeastern part of the state.
And also uh
we're in a, a memo
memo of understanding with
the grid united on
their uh phase
two of the South line project,
which is uh in the
southern part of the state,
it runs parallel to the border.
Um And we've
assisted
with applying for
a federal grant through the group program
on that phase two of that
line.
So what's, that's a lot of
development, a lot of new stuff to
talk about in New Mexico, what's
driving all the transmission to
development? And a lot of it
has to do with
New Mexico passed the
Energy Transition Act
and I believe it was 2019
that mandates pretty
aggressive
um
zero carbon
goals.
Uh We need
to reach certain
uh uh
landmarks
between now and
2045. At
which time, both
the co ops and the
investor owned utilities will have
to be 100%
carbon uh
free. And
so uh New Mexico is
not alone in that effort. There are
quite a number of Western
states uh
most significantly California,
which has an enormous load who has
very similar
clean energy targets
and presents a, an
attractive
market for
uh export of New Mexico's
renewable energy
sources.
And if you'll turn to page
four, that shows you
and New Mexico and California
are not alone that
that map identifies
the, the targets of all
of the Western states in terms
of uh shifting to renewable
energy. Uh
page five, I think
we've, you've been on this committee
for a few years, these maps are
not new to you. Uh
Again, New Mexico has
tremendous wind
and solar
potential. Uh
New me to, to give you a little
bit of a, an idea
of, of
the significance of these
resources. New Mexico's
entire load is
right around
3000
megawatts.
And so the the wind
and solar potential
is is many,
many multiples
of that.
Um
And as you can also see from
these maps, the wind and the
solar are located,
the the best resources are
are not located in the Rio
Grande Corridor where the population
center is and where all of the transmission
infrastructure is. It's located
in other parts of the state that
need lines to
get the
resources to the grid. And
then New Mexico's
existing grid needs to
be upgraded because
there's very little capacity
left on it
to accommodate
uh the significant
uh megawatts
available in wind and
solar.
Uh On page
six, you'll see
uh it's a couple
of years old. This is the the most
recent map we could find but it
shows uh New
Mexico's wind
generation penetration as compared
to other uh
state markets
or other state producers.
And uh you'll see
New Mexico is doing pretty
well. We're at
34.9%
of all energy
produced in New Mexico
is wind energy. Uh
Some of the midwestern
states are doing a bit better.
And again, if we want to
improve that number
transmission development of
transmission and then also storage
is key.
So um
I want to
get a little deeper into our
project. Um
If you'll turn to page eight, I, I
think maps pictures tell
1000 words and it's, it's
uh As I, I talk a little bit about
each project, it gives you a
little better understanding
if you're looking at where it is. Uh
The Western Spear project was
completed and put into service
in 2021.
Uh Upon
uh completion of that project,
it was sold to P and M
and became the largest
upgrade to P AND M system
since the
mid-eighties.
So, uh
40 years ago, that
is how old a lot
of New Mexico's
existing transmission
system is 40 to 50 years
old. Um
This unlocked 80
megawatts of sorry 800
megawatts of new wind
generation in the Corona
area. Uh There are
four new wind
farms pattern energy
was our development partner for this
project and they also developed
the wind farms
um and that's been in
service and, and working well
and part of P and M's grid
since uh
late
2021.
And then on the heels of that,
we have
um the Sun
Zia and the Rio Soul
projects. Those used
to be the same project. It
was Sun Zia line one
and line two about
18 months ago. Uh
Pattern Energy
bought just
line one from
Southwester Power Group.
And so that has now been split
into two separate
projects.
Sunia is
um in full construction.
Now, they closed a
very large uh
construction financing
for the transmission
line and the
two very large
wind farms also near
Corona uh in
late 2023.
Uh a little
bit of construction had started
before then. It's in
full construction now. And we've
got 2000
construction workers in the field
uh working on the wind farms
and the transmission line
and it's gonna
take two years to build it. So those
construction workers are going to be
occupied for quite some time.
Um I
ran into Brian Condon
a few weeks ago and he was
marveling that he's got 200
electricians in the new
Mexico uh converter
station that are going to be busy
wiring that for a couple of years.
He's quite pleased.
Um
We're expecting that to be in
service sometime early
in 2026.
It's unlocking 3000
megawatts of new wind
generation uh
to be exported to
California.
Um
It's sister
line, I think I can use that
term. Uh R
Soul uh
is uh lagging
behind Sunzi on development
by about two years.
Uh It's close to
100% land
acquisition and permitting.
Um
There's a little bit more work to
do on that and uh
some more engineering et
cetera. The significant
difference between Sun
and Rio Soul
is that Sun is a
DC direct
current line that will
run without any off
ramps, kind of like a superhighway
from Corona all the way to
the Pinal Substation
in Arizona.
Rio Soul is significantly
different and it's an alternating
current line and
it's not gonna act as a
superhighway. It's gonna have
quite a number of off
ramps in New
Mexico. Now, the project
is still working on its
interconnection
uh uh plan
its design. But
right now on the table, there's as
many as six substations
that would enable New
Mexico wind power to stay
in New Mexico and get connected
to New Mexico's grid
for New Mexico
customers.
Moving on to
page 10.
The Lucky
Corridor more line
transmission project is in the
northeastern part of the
state. It's a much smaller line
but very
important in that. It will be the first
new lineup in that part of the state
to
work on
Unlocking rich
Wind that is in that
Union County
area. Don
Carlos is slated to be
the anchor tenant.
They're working on land acquisition
and, and
um uh the
other hold up on that project
is, is Don
Carlos finding
folks to buy its, its wind
generation. They've been participating
in R FPs and,
and uh uh both
in New Mexico and Arizona.
And once that's uh
established, it,
it sort of is a chicken
and egg thing. You need a customer
before you can get financing to
build the wind farm and the,
and the transmission. And
so, um and the
customer wants to see that you're actually,
you know that you're going to be able to build it.
So that creates a tension
there.
And then finally, uh
the last uh project
we have under lease is the North
Path transmission project. This,
this one is a monster.
Uh it's a DC line that goes
across the northern third
of the state. Um
It's designed to carry 4000
megawatts of, of wind
power.
Um
And again, it also will, is
planned to be a DC
line. Uh It's being
developed in
partnership with Rita
uh by in energy
transmission.
And then finally, our new projects
since last, last October,
uh we in mo us with
the Crossroads Hobbs
Roadrunner Transmission
Line. Um
It's uh in
contrast to the other
projects we'll hook
into the, the
Eastern interconnection
system. There are two
large interconnection systems in
the United States. There's not a lot
of interconnecting in between them, which is
a problem that probably needs to
be solved in the next 10 years or
so. But
this one will feed into
feed power into that
eastern side and flow
to the east. At least that's the
idea. And
this line was identified
by um
Southwester Power Pool, the
RT O that's,
that's uh
um has this
area in its service area
or its balancing authority
area and was identified
as a line to both
benefit uh their
system both economically
and in terms of
reliability. Uh
That southeastern portion
of the
uh state is experiencing
significant load growth
um based on
electrification, electric
vehicles, uh the
oil and gas fields are being elect
electrified and then
also data centers.
Um
If you haven't heard IAA A
those fancy
smart
searches, they take
10 times the power
and that
is happening whether we wanted to or
not, at least that's my experience of
it. And so while we chase
these goals, these renewable
energy goals that were hard to
meet to begin with
um the, the load
growth that is
being experienced not just in New
Mexico, uh but
nationwide is gonna make
that even harder.
Um And then
finally,
uh the South
Line project, uh this
is uh being built
by Grid United
and uh Black Forest
partners. And
this has several phases, the
first phase
um which is
in uh mostly in Arizona
but dips into New Mexico.
Uh uh and,
and reaches Hill Dago
on the southeastern side.
Um That one is already,
that phase of the project is already
in construction. They got a, a federal
grant for that. Rita's
involvement is just in phase
two, the portion from
Hidalgo to
Afton and we're
assisting them uh
in an application for a different
uh federal grant program
based on a innovative
technology. Uh if
they get the grant, they'll be able to
overbuild it. And
the, the um
uh uh idea
is that they'll have, uh
they'll put the structures in
place and the initial
uh line will be an AC line, but
they'll have wires to be able
to hang a DC
line later on the same
structures in the same writer
for
um moving to
on to some other things that Reid has been
involved in. We've hosted
over the last two years
in 2022 and
2023.
Uh storage work workshops,
storage is really vitally
important as we
depend on
solar and wind
as large generation
sourcess. In contrast
to oil and gas, those are
intermittent sources
and can't be
called up to ramp up
at, at a given time, either
the wind's blowing or the sun
shining. Um
And that creates some
balancing problems for the
grid. And so
storage uh
provides the ability
to store power and firm
those resources. And so we've
been studying that
um long duration storage
for the amount of storage we need. The
technology is really not
there yet.
Um
Short duration and utilities
are getting wise to that. And I,
some of P and M's new solar
farms are adding a
storage component the
shorter duration for our
type battery
storage.
Um
We are planning to have another workshop
either in spring or fall
of 2025. Uh, the
topic is yet to be determined,
but we're anticipating, it'll be
broader than
storage.
Um,
and skipping ahead.
Uh, we've, uh,
laid out our most recent
set of, uh, audited
financials, uh, on
page 15,
um,
and we can update this. We're
just in your end and didn't want to
give you numbers that changed a
lot, um, before
they got audited. Um,
so happy to provide additional
information to Sabina once
that's available. Uh
Rita has been now
for a couple of years
uh self funded.
Um because of
the success of the Western Spirit
project going into
service, we get a,
a lease payment
from that project uh once
a year and have been able and,
and we get additional
uh development
funds from
the other projects
that have been able to
uh uh fulfill
our budget needs for now.
Uh As you can tell Reed is
growing, um
the budget should grow as
should the staff et over the next
couple of years to handle
everything we're trying to
do.
On page 16,
we lay out our, our goals
and priorities for the next
couple of years.
Uh Again, a lot of the projects
we are working on are in
support of the Energy Transition
Act. Um
We have
been for the last couple of years
encouraging
uh new Mexico
utilities
to
be a part of
a regional transmission
organization. A
shorthand
RT O.
Right now in the West
there there is a, a
um
we should, next time we'll put a map
of the RT OS in the presentation
so that you all can see this. There
is a space from
uh West Texas and the
Midwest
uh all the way to California
that does not have an RT O
or an independent system
operator that has
instead 38 different
balancing authorities
that run their own little part
of the grid, which makes
it very, very difficult
to move power in
between them.
Um RT OS
have been shown
to save ratepayers
money because if you
have a larger market
with a larger
availability of supply,
you can
buy and sell
the cheapest power available
at that given time. And if you have a
bigger footprint, you have a bigger
chance of that power
being cheaper. So
that's something we support.
Um
We continue
to work
on streamlining permitting
processes. The the
real time on permitting
is really at the federal
level. Um
But as you can see, Western Spirit
took 10 years,
Sandia
is getting close to 20
Rio Soul will be more than
that. Uh I'm hoping
that North Path will
take somewhere
between 10 and 15. And
so, um
it's kind of like planting a
tree. The best
uh best time to plant a tree
was 20 years ago.
The second best time to plant a tree
is today.
So
um the
it's, it's important for
us to, you know, yes,
be good stewards of the environment.
Yes. Uh be
safe and follow all the rules
and we need to get a
lot more transmission
infrastructure online as soon
as we can. If we're gonna
make uh the energy
transit Transition Act
goals happen. Um
Finally, I want to give a shout out to
our board. Um Our
board is very hard working.
Um uh
board members are listed on
page 17. They
are all volunteers.
Uh They come from different parts of the
state, different professions
and uh they
work hard and we wouldn't be able to
do half of what we're doing without
them and
I'll end there and stand
for questions.
>> Thank you very much for the robust
presentation, Miss
Page.
Did you have any comments
at this time? Ok. Thank you very
much. We'll go over to Representative
Chatfield.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
Uh I come from the northeastern
part of the state. We have
end of energy. We
have Nextera
and we have pattern up in
all in my district
working there. And
one of the things that,
that uh
we are blessed with this Mason
Lance community college
when those kids go there and they learn
how to climb windmills, work on
windmills. Uh By
the time
they finished with their
certificate, they, they've got a
job waiting
for the. So we
had a program where our high
school kids could go there
and many of them had their cert
certificates before they
turned 18. So they
had to wait for their birthday
to go for a job they were
already qualified for. So,
it's been a real blessing,
uh, to us in a lot of
ways.
Um,
I was there when, when
Rita was
invented, by the way
and it just kind of, I
wasn't elected, but I
was at the legislature.
It kind of died off for a few
years and now it's come back really
strong and, and I'm glad to see it
up and running something.
I would ask you to
help look out for the State
of New Mexico with
is the US Department
of Energy
has made a
declaration
of proposed energy
corridors or when
they would waive
all the permitting process you
were just talked about
and just go in there
and, and
uh take those
corridors for
energy transmission
lines and I,
I, I'm all for
minimizing the permitting
process, but
we need to be respectful of,
of private land
ownership. We have a
process
uh where if a
public carrier
goes to private van,
uh if
they can uh
use eminent domain
to assess the
price of that, to
assess the
various uh
needs for it. So there's a
process for that and
we just,
uh I strongly oppose
the federal government
usurping state
and private
authority to take
land from private
citizens. I just
uh but
I oppose it enough that I
wrote a letter
signed by many of
my colleagues and sent it to our
congressional
delegation
uh that we stating
that we opposed to taking
a private property uh
without going through the process.
I don't, I'm very
much as I just say, I
support the wind
energy, solar
energy, American
energy. I
like, I like American
energy, but I
opposed to taking a
private property. So I
would ask you guys as
a uh as the folks
that kind of
stand to watch our state
for, for those things. This
is not just affects our state.
Are you aware of what I'm talking
about?
>> Chair and
Representative Chatfield? Yes, I am
very aware of. It's, I
can even use the letters
and IETC, the
National Interest
Energy Transmission
Corridor Project.
Um We're watching
that very closely.
Um And, and I've also
heard from some
um some
military folks withs
with different concerns
from yours but concerns
and, and so let me just
for the committee catch
up where that process is.
It's the, it's a
it's a four stage
process to identify
these corridors
and they have just finished up
stage two and there is
a, a public comment
period following each
stage.
And
the,
I've seen the map and it looks like
somebody took a sharpie and colored
in, in all of Union
County, which
is understandably
alarming. Now, in
reality that the,
the, the next two phases
are supposed to refine
that down. And I would be surprised
if the corridor
is more than a few
miles wide. And
so, but that doesn't completely
alleviate your main concern,
which is uh federal
overreach.
Um
So
my understanding and
I'm, I'm gonna have to study up and maybe
meet with you separately
is that it doesn't
avoid the permitting. The
idea is to get
it moving a little bit
quicker. So, so the
big federal level permitting
is uh the N
A process
and typically
that is headed by the Bureau of Land
Management and there's up to
13 additional federal
agencies that would participate
in that process. And I'm starting to
understand that the federal agencies don't
really play that well with
each other. They're
competitive.
Um They
don't cooperates,
there is nothing about that,
that, that takes
less time. And
so
the average N
A permit was taking
four years and
some of them as much as 6
to 8.
And so, you know, there's a
lot of risk to
a developer in, in building
any one of these and, and that
kind of a lengthy permitting
process is part of that
risk. So the,
it would not
avoid
NPA. The idea is that if
it's in a corridor it
would be on, it would be fast
tracked.
Um, I,
I don't have
a, what I think
would be a satisfactory response
to you and the idea of a, a federal
eminent domain process. I,
I don't know what that's gonna look
like yet. I think we're probably
two years away from them
actually identifying the specific
corridors.
Um There have been other federal
efforts to, to work
on transmission planning
and development, including with
the eminent domain tool
that have utterly
failed. And I
might, I, some of
my development uh partner
folks are just not impressed with
this effort and don't think it's going to go
anywhere. Um Again,
that's nothing official that would alleviate
your concerns. But the
best I can do today is say
we're watching it and understand
what you're worried
about.
>> So Mr Chair
N A can take
many, many
routes. It can either a
full-blown.
Uh
So,
or if I have no
significant impact
or uh
I'm trying to think what the shortest
process is. Uh
But anyway, there's several
different routes that need need for
those. Uh My,
my concern is
that
you skip the eminent
domain process, which
is the process through which you
condemn private landowners.
It might be just a
mile wide strip. But if
it's mile mile, that makes a
lot of difference to me.
Right. >> You're
not wrong and you did >> say
that NPA requires
public input. I
am the
state representative for
the area where these
corridors are being
put. And I
found out about the public
comment at the period the
day it was due at
five o'clock. That is
not enough. And
I was never contacted
by the Department of Energy.
Ever. I, I
found out, I found
out about it on Facebook.
Uh No
contact to me
about these
corridors.
Uh You
have a
what ARTC
surveys? You
have biological
surveys. I know
I have worked for 21
state and federal agencies
on watershed restoration
projects. I know how to
jump through those hoops and I know
how many hoops they are and they
are sometimes too slow.
I agree.
But there's a
reason for that and that's so
that we protect our private
landowners is one of those
reasons. I'm very concerned about
that. So, uh
I see the benefits
but I don't wanna
throw the baby out with the bathwater.
We need to protect our, our
private landowners
and we need to
be able to take some of this energy
out of our area. So,
thank you, Mr Chair.
>> Thank you, Representative
Representative Lujan.
>> Thank you Mr Chair. I'm
gonna,
I don't know what the energy
waves are going on
here, but I'll try to be
at a distance because I seem
to be a conductor
here.
Um Thank you for being
here. Thank you for all your
work and taking over
this really important
position for, for Weta
and just for, for
practical purposes and really
education purposes. Because
when we're talking about energy and we're talking
about uh electricity,
we take it for granted. Everybody
does as long as you
flip the switch and it turns on,
that's all we really care about.
What is going
on
in a global scale is
how we are going
to um
change our
energy grid and
electrify it.
And we're under
mandates both
statewide and
national wide
to, to reach
these goals can.
So
if you can, if you have any
an answer for this and looking
at our future, I, I would
just like you mentioned this to
what is the estimate
growth and need
for our, our load
growth um
both for our state
but also on a on
a bigger scale nationally. When you
talk about the,
the increase in our data
and our usage and all the, all the,
all those sorts of things. What does
that look like? Mr
Chen?
>> Um Chair
Padilla and Representative
Lujan. I don't
have a nationwide
figure at my fingertips,
but I, I could get that for
you all. Um The
one figure that I'm somewhat
familiar with, I was at a
um a workshop
hosted by SPS which
is uh owned by Excel
Energy. They, they have a
footprint down in the southeast
part of New Mexico.
They're anticipating
that they will double their load
by 2030 which
is in six
years.
So uh and P
and M they
are in the middle of resource
and transmission planning
and realize
that the plan that they
submitted to the PR C most
recently did
not account for sufficient load
growth. So they are doing, they're in the middle
of a and a
refresh on that
study and, and I should have
those numbers in the next
few weeks and can provide
those as well.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. I think we need to be
updated on that information
as it is um
being uh
introduced and, and
readdressed Mr
Chair. I've been to I think,
five different
energy
um conferences
including the Energy Council, which
I'm a member of and
we talked about many of these issues,
particularly the Federal
um guidelines that have
changed and EPA
guidelines that have changed as
well. We are in the
forefront as an energy state to
be kept briefed on
what is going on
and some of the, the scale
and some of the, the information I
have I have gone
uh and seen
in that increase in load. It's
not, it's
not like a
of a, an
incremental like
change. It's a huge, it's the
slope of that change
is, is
um
is um
not perplexing, but it
is a real issue
we have to deal with
and I don't think with the measures
and, and the amount of
uh renewables and everything that we're
doing energy wise,
we're going to to meet
capacity, so to speak.
And so what
we, why we have Rita in
place and, and the, and
why it's important that
we, we do
have Rita is for that transmission
line and for the, the increase
in the growth of what that transmission
line means for
everybody in New Mexico, but
also in the growth of our, of our
grid and how we're
looking in a national level.
We are, we are a, a
forefront player in
our state along with Colorado.
The two of us are the biggest players
right now and creating
that grid modernization
for the Western
states. Now, what
that's going to mean is what we need to be
briefed on what, what that means
for our future and how we're going to be able
to
um
to continue to
grow and meet the needs and the
demand is,
is at the forefront and we need
to be briefed on this, I think a little
more regularly. And
that's why I'm glad we we were
having this brief today. But
uh with that importance,
I I have to ask a couple of other
questions. How much
um
uh madam director. Thank you for being
here again. Um
What with our
local companies and the growth of
our local companies with renewables?
How many of those companies are
New Mexico
based?
>> Uh Thank you for your question.
Um
uh Senator
Padilla and um
Representative Lujan.
So no, the
the companies that Rita is
working with right now, none
of them are, are New Mexico
formed companies.
And let
me put it sort of an asterisk on
that, the kind
of
capital needed
to build this size of
infrastructure. We don't
have an energy company
that could do that.
Um
The
Western spirit spent
north of $100 million
of their own capital before they
got construction financing.
Sunia is twice as
big. And so you can
imagine what kind
of their own capital
that you're not gonna get a bank
to put money into a project until
you have 100% site control
and 100% permitting
done, which means you
have your, all of your deals with your
landowners before you can even
go to apply for the construction
loan. So the capital
outlay to get
one of these going
is
really, really significant
and there's really, they, they have
to be either national multinational
companies to handle
that kind of um
up front capital,
capital requirement.
Did that answer your
question? >> It does.
And that's really where I'm going
is, is how much this is going to
cost us and how we
are focused on, on the cost
and interest of, of
meeting those demands
on a,
on a capital level. It's,
it's huge. We do have
um sources from
um government
uh grants and
funding, but the
investment from our state really
hasn't been there um
completely in the way in the
scale that it needs to be.
In my opinion, Mr Chair and I
think this is something that we,
we haven't really
paid uh close
enough attention to what we're
doing. I myself have
hope Western legislators
for an energy type summit
last year and had some
of these discussions
and we
are really behind uh
behind on
what we need to do in order to meet
these, these deadlines
that have been mentioned
for um
our car, our carbon
goals, excuse
me, I
just want to bring this, these things
up. But in
order for us to continue
this conversation, get in depth, we're
gonna, we, we need more briefing.
We need to be on top of these issues and
what is going on as
far as what is going on
federally. I would ask maybe
that we even have a brief for the federal
government coming here much to
what representative
Chatfield was talking about. So
we can understand how those
laws and those
rules. I think they believe they're
rulemaking that are going
to affect our state
and our energy sector.
I think it's really important for us
to, to
really, really engage
on this issue in a way that we
really haven't.
Um And
we don't have a plan, so to
speak from the state
per se as how we're going
to essentially
meet those goals around the
issues of demand
and, and cost.
So
this is, this is really
important to me, obviously.
Um And I, I just like to
continue this
conversation
in, in a, in a, in a bigger, bigger
scale to be quite honest,
Mr Chair.
Um
I guess one of my other questions
is as we are moving and,
and growing
um with
the transmission and, and looking
for flexibility and those sorts of things
that you mentioned on page
five.
Mr Chair, how
are we asure of those, the
transparency in
all the, the, the communication
and the efforts that we're putting forward
to,
to,
to get the information and to
understand the information
through PR
C process and all the, all
the processes, Mr
Chair.
>> Um Thank you,
Representative Lujan uh
Chair Padilla.
Um
So I, you asked a very
broad question, I'm not entirely
sure how to approach it. Um
Rita. Rita
has all its projects are
pretty well accessible
on its website.
Um And
I, we're working on, it hasn't
had an update for about five years and I've, I've
just hired a new pr firm to,
to work on that so that, that our
information is
more available.
But I certainly think
Rita is,
is
you Google Transmission and you
probably find us first or pretty
close to the top. And so we can,
as we're re rebuilding the
website um
include a resource page
that explains what's going
on with, for example, the,
the nei process, the,
the National uh
Transmission Corridor process
and, and alert folks
earlier
um to
those kinds of
uh comment opportunities,
that sort of thing. Um I
am working
at uh identifying
and organizing stakeholders
in terms of my own
interactions with both
of the state and federal level.
And um if you
want to get on our
uh our
board meetings were meeting with
everything that's going on somewhere in
the range
of every 6
to 8 weeks. Um
We post those, but there's a
list of for folks who
want to get the agendas
and the meeting in invites
um just automatically
emailed to you because I think,
I think that, you know,
stakeholder engagement is
not just making the information
available. It's actively
sharing it with the folks who want
to find it and so we can do better
on that. >> That's great. Thank
you. Thank you, Mr Chair. I could go on, I
have lots of questions to ask,
but, you know, I will ask you
offline as well.
But I just really want like
information to be
um at the
forefront of our, our members
because I don't think we
talk about this enough. I don't think
we're engaged enough and where
we're how things are changing
so quickly, especially
around with the, with the federal
government is doing and
we need some answers and we need to
understand what is, what is
going on and what the investment
side is for our
state um
to fully engage into
the future of, of energy.
Um the energy sector of our
state. It's exciting
as well because this does,
we are entering an
economic development
opportunity here and
we need to understand
what we need to be putting in
place and for those opportunities
to come to fruition. Thank you, Mr
Chair. I appreciate the time.
Thank you, >> Representative
Senator
>> Griggs.
>> Thank you Mr Chair. And
you know what I like
about these
things is it, it's showing
that, you know, New
Mexico can be a player
in all of the
above,
not just oil and gas,
but wind and solar
as well. But what
we have to, we have to understand
when we see these projects
is what these projects do is
they provide construction
jobs, they provide
uh opportunities
in that way. They don't necessarily
provide the continual
jobs that
oil and gas provide.
They don't provide the state, the
revenue that oil and gas
provides. So
for everybody, when we look
at all of this stuff. We need to
understand everything for what
it is, not
that it's good or bad
because it's good.
It just isn't gonna
replace some of the other
stuff that we have
and we have to as a state
because of our
dependence on
energy. Uh We
have to understand where we
get it from, how it
works and how
can we help those guys
or how can we do things with
the, with the oil and gas industry
that helps them be cleaner
and better, uh, which
will be
consistent with some of
this, uh,
Mr Chair. There's a, there's a
requirement that most places
have is they have to have,
they have to have 60 herds
of just continual
generated power and
hiccups in that
your lights blink, things
happen. Uh
And so
far, so
far, wind and solar hasn't
shown that it can do that
continually
uh consistently.
So those are things that as
we go forward, you know, we
have to, we have to work
with as well. We, we've
got a report here
from Rio
Rio Soul
that talks about
uh what's happening
with their line
and it talks about the construction
jobs, it talks about the revenue
coming in and it talks about the
11 jobs or so
that will exist once they're
done the
11 jobs. I
just want everybody to hear that
number. It's not very dang
big. Uh
So those are
things that, that come to
pass are
these are these companies
going to, is
New Mexico is
New Mexico. First of all
gonna benefit from any of the
energy because
there's some yeses and nos with
some of that
uh
Sunzi was designed to
provide energy to
California
are gonna be spinoffs
for New Mexico or we,
we'll hope so.
Uh, but we've got a, we've
got a line that they
talk about.
Uh, on page seven, they
talk about the north
path line
and the north path line
is a direct current
line.
It's not an alternating current line.
It's direct current line.
The Trace Amigos line
that was proposed
years ago and I'm not sure these
are in the, they're the same
line or, or
not,
but uh the
direct current line is a buried,
buried line. You
supposedly get as
much energy
in a
cable about this
big as
you do with those major
transmission lines.
So when you see that,
that's quite a, quite a
benefit other
than when it goes in as
direct current and
it needs to come out as alternating
current
to provide the energy
that you need. It's an
expensive proposition
doesn't mean it's not doable,
doesn't mean it's not a good thing.
It's just, that's, that's
an issue with that in New
Mexico. I don't guess anything
we have here
hardly runs on direct
current.
But,
ok,
it's a, it's a great
idea and it's a great,
great opportunity I, I
believe,
but at the same time, you have to
understand what it is
because it's not what you
see out there
on those big transmission
lines or AC lines.
This is a, this is a DC
line, it's a different
thing.
Um
But just so everybody
knows. So when we're, we're
talking about stuff,
we're talking about the
opportunities that New
Mexico has.
What are some of the challenges that
go along with that
and how can we then take
it and merge it
with some of the other stuff
that we have to
make New Mexico, the
worldwide leader
in energy production and
generation of all
types
of all types.
That's what we can do
in this state.
That's what this, this
legislature can help
the businesses that
want to do all of this
accomplishment.
But we have to work with
them to do that.
We can't just say we want to
work with you
and not with you.
We have to work with everybody
to bring all of this stuff
to uh to fruition.
I, the State of
Wyoming, for instance. And
Senator, I know you've worked
on some of these things in the
past and
it was an attention getter to
you sometimes, but it
was a means to
tax
win generation
and the uh the state
of Wyoming, I believe taxes
one generation at about a dollar
kilowatt hour,
right at, at the
generated source.
Uh
So they make, they make
money from that but they don't
make replacement
money from even the oil and gas
that they have in that.
But, but they do something
and that's what, what happened with
that. But uh
again, I just, I just
want, it's, it's
interesting to see that somebody's
back in the DC
game and not
just, you know, staying with
the, with the big AC power
lines going to the, to
the DC power line.
But, uh, I'm, I'm gonna
be interesting to follow that and
how that, how that all
all plays out. But
y'all, this is
what they're doing is, is
great.
What we need to be doing though
is doing it all
we can, you know, New Mexico
today and
this is, this is a song and dance
for oil and gas. But if,
if New Mexico didn't
have oil and gas, how many of us
could afford to live
here?
Look at your
budget, figure
out how you dress that
without owning gash
because you flat can't
do it.
So let's help
them, help us,
help these guys, help
us and make
New Mexico a better place for all
of us to be. So, thank
you, Mr Chair. That's my song
and dance. >> Thank
you, Senator. Uh choose
to comment at all. Don't have to if you'd
like
>> chair Senator
Griggs. Um
I don't think I disagreed with a single
thing. You said we're in
violent agreement.
So,
uh, you're not a single
thing, you're not incorrect about any
of that. Um,
and, uh,
wind and solar
development in New Mexico is not
gonna replace the revenues that
oil and gas bring in. It's
completely different economics.
Um That's a
headache you all need to
solve. Um,
I mean, we the the and
yes, construction, you're not
wrong that, that we are,
uh, generating a
whole lot more construction jobs
than permanent jobs.
Um, there are quite a number
of permanent jobs and,
you know, we have some
workforce development to fill those
jobs. So we have New Mexico kids staying
in New Mexico to work here. So I don't
think that's a bad thing.
Um, and the one sort
of exclamation
point I want to put on the construction job.
Yes, they're construction jobs. Yes, they're
temporary. But if you see what we're
doing, we're gonna have rolling
thousands of construction jobs
for the next decade and,
and you know, the kind of massive
infrastructure that's and the
dollars that are coming into Mexico
to build those infrastructure. There's
not another industry that's doing that.
So I don't say no to
that. That's kind of a no brainer
to, to do that. So
that's all I have to say. Thank
you. >> Thank you,
Senator. Thank you for your
presentation there. I, we'll go to
Representative Roybal
Caballero.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair
and thank you very much and congratulations
on your position.
Um
So I have and
thank you, Senator Griggs again
for your
comments. I think it's
important to note that
we need to um
when we talk about diversifying
our economy,
it's, it's really for our
survival and for
sustainability.
I think that's really
important
point
and um
to the director's point
that renewable
energies are different
economies and
that's an area that
it's not a good or a bad
thing. We're not trying
to
rid our state
of certain economies.
We're trying to prepare
our overall state to
invite the
economies that are
already in the future.
We should have been doing
this a very long time ago,
but we're doing it.
And so I just wanted
to add those. I
think there's a false
narrative
about
jobs not being
permanent with renewables
or there are not being
career pathways.
I think it's completely the
opposite. I,
along with several
of my colleagues, as
Representative Lujan mentioned
are part of national
discussions
about global
economies and how they're
impacting
um renewable
energy. I think ultimately,
we're all on the path,
Mr Chair
and
panelists
and we should be and protecting
our planet. That really is
what we're about to do.
The bottom line or the
overall arching
goal is protecting
our planet for future generations,
period. How we
do that has to be done
in the cleanest way
possible because that's
part of protecting our air
land and water
period. There's no discussion
about that. There's no
future for my grandchildren
if we
don't
go and step ahead
right now and their Children.
And that's what I'm concerned about.
So with that
in mind, I I
was one of the sponsors of the
Energy Transition Act
Community Solar and
Geothermal along with my
colleagues. So
I know Geothermal came
in after the
eta
passage and the priorities
were different. But
one of my, my
questions is
um and I in
in and I
note just before I go to
that on page
five, it's very significant
to see that map on the right
hand side
um which talks
about the 824,000
megawatts of highest quality
quality solar
potential uh
on state
trust and private lands.
And that's a great relationship
that exists there with our
state land um
trust
and working in a
great partnership with
our private sector
and that there's a history
there and we need to
capitalize on that as much as
possible. And
so I'm, I'm glad to
see that you put
it in a way in which we can
visualize the
assets uh of
that.
Um
And, and thank you to
Rita for
your active
participation over
several years. I think it's a five
year span on the
Community Solar Act.
Um There was an active
participation. Your input
was very
gratifying and helped move
us forward. I'm sorry
that we're stuck on a lot of
regulatory issues
still. Um
It's, it's
kind of heart-wrenching for
myself as one of the
sponsors that
has kept tabs on what's
going on with the regulatory
nature of this. But we sort of
projected that because
of the involvement of the utilities.
And um, there's
that push and pull
that occurs when
you're trying to make a
transition and
it's understandable, but I just
wish that we could stop
that or, or
move it forward.
Um And I appreciate
finally, Mr Chair,
one of your board members,
Maani Chavez Baroin
was one of the
drivers that I
worked very closely with all
the five years that I worked
on for community solar.
She's a brilliant mind,
a brilliant mind
and young
generation and
tribal and so
she's a great asset.
So I appreciate that she's
one of your board members.
So, back to the
question,
how do you see
geothermal development
integrating with
Rita's project
priorities in the
future?
And, and if
you know and understand
geothermal,
there will be
extensive transmission
energy once we tap
into the
100 ft
down to
300 ft, hopefully
not that far down.
And we will need to
trans
of
transmit
that energy
extract and transmit
it so
that we can continue
to
build sustainable
heat
energy
for our electricity
and all other needs.
So how do you see that
integrating madam
director
>> uh Ch Padilla
and um
representative Robo caballero.
Um I agree with
you. The geothermal is really, really
important in the energy mix.
And Rita has
not done much
with it and has not had much experience
with it yet. In part
because we don't do generation,
we do the transmission to reach the
generation that
said um
it's becoming
a bigger part of the
conversation. And
in my view, Rita definitely
needs to get smarter about
geothermal in
part because it
is,
uses some of the same
techniques that oil and
gas in terms of drilling
require. And we'd, we'd
have a shot at
keeping those jobs
in New Mexico.
Um It, the
economics of geothermal are
a ways off solar and
wind have become
less expensive than
gas and oil.
Uh In fact, it's a little
ironic but the oil and gas
companies because of
that price differential
are electrifying
the gas and oil fields.
They're, it's cheaper to buy
renewables now than
to
use the energy
that they're
extracting to,
to, to for
extract more resources.
So um
I'll pledge to you that we need to
have a geothermal map
here too. So, so that
because New Mexico does have
significant geothermal
uh resources
and um I think we've
only PNM has a very
small part of their load.
They have a geothermal,
I think they've got one generation
uh geothermal plant
that, that I want to go see and
find out more about.
>> And thank you and you're
absolutely correct. There needs
to be a relationship between
the generation aspect and
the transmission aspect.
And that's why I
think that that
Rita could
begin to look at its
project priorities
now in
preparation for
that conversation
because there
are, there
is already
in place
the capacity to
generate it.
So then
we'll need to find out we'll
need a better way
of looking at
how we can transfer
that energy. So that
would be a great
new priority to look
at that you integrate
into your existing.
So I would encourage
that.
And New
Mexico
in what is it called
in, in Soros, the New
Mexico
Tech
is the leader
in all
of the science, the
resource development
and um project
development. So I
would encourage
you to. And
if I can, I
reached out to
one of the key individuals
that worked with me in the
bill and he
indicated that he'd be willing
to um
work,
communicate with you and we
can facilitate a discussion
on how we can then begin
to uh integrate.
So I I will do that. I'll be
happy to do that and I'll
connect also with
New Mexico Tech. It's
a very big importance
to me. >> Uh
Representative Rob uh
Caballero
and uh uh CH
I would want it would be
wonderful for me to, to meet
with your contact at
New Mexico Tech on
Geothermal. Uh
I know they're working a lot on carbon
sequestration. That's not
something we could be directly involved
in, but it's certainly probably
part of the discussion
for overall
solutions to get off of
carbon. >> That's
exactly right. And to meet our
carbon um
objectives and
goals in a
timely manner. So I, I
will do that. So the
next and final question I
have had to do with,
um let's see,
page 1616,
um had to do with the comments
about the
Representative
Loja Grace about how
many of the companies that you're
working with are New Mexico
owned. And
your answer was none. And I
knew that already.
However, because I've been on
this committee and Economic and Rural
Development Committee and we visited
all of um had many
discussions throughout my
12 year, 12 years. It
sounds like I've been here forever,
but it's,
it's been 12 years.
So
um
return on
investment,
this is key for me
because even though
you have companies
that are not New Mexico
owned, how
do we take
advantage
of
our capitalization
in these companies
and the return
on investment,
how do we use that to
leverage
um the
development
of or the the
to assist New Mexico
owned companies
um to
then take
on the role of
energy transmission.
Um Not just
I I know you mentioned some
impediments, we're permitting
and infrastructure.
Um but we're not
asking a lot enough
of these companies
out of state companies
to
reinvest
their ry
in New Mexico to
assist
with the development of New
Mexico owned companies.
So I think we need to
start that mindset
and incorporate those
kinds of questions
with our out of state
companies when
they come in here or
as they're developing further
projects, we need to ask
them. OK, you have
made 60 something
percent profit. Just
an example. I don't think their
profits are that large, but
just as an example,
how much of that
percentage will
you reinvest and
help leverage
um in New Mexico
for New Mexico owned companies
to
advance
and move us
forward.
We're already seen
as a national.
Um We're,
we're on the map for
our renewable energy
efforts in this state.
Why not move it forward
faster on that note?
So I I'm
not sure you have an
answer to that, but that's
my ask of you
as you
um move
the, the discussions
further with these existing
companies and any others that are
looking at coming to New
Mexico, it has
to be written into the Partnership
Agreement.
Um I believe
that that percentage
be allocated and
then somehow we work
with again, I'm putting
a lot of pressure on the Finance
authority and, and this
Russell, but somehow we need
to then
incorporate that
into our funds
and then keep
moving forward in our renewable
world. So I don't
know Mr Chair if, if the
director would like to comment.
Um or, but
that is something that I'm
proposing that you
incorporate. Thank
you, Mr
Chair,
>> uh
Tardia uh
representative uh Robo
Carra. You saved the best for last
year, didn't you? Um
I, I don't
know that I can comment much. I
the there's not
to my knowledge other
than uh
materials that they're able to
purchase here and
uh construction jobs
in terms of reinvestment into
New Mexico right now.
Um in, in terms of New
Mexico businesses,
the counties where the
lines are located,
they're each, um,
I know for
Western Spirit, Sania
and Rio Soul, they
do community benefit
agreements with the counties,
uh based on a formula
that's, uh you know, the number
of miles of the line in the county
and then that, that's, that's the
amount for the Community Benefit
Agreement.
Um
Certainly something that we can add to
the discussion. Uh
I'm trying to think how, what
that's gonna look like.
Um Really and, and keep
in mind we don't do generation, which
is where most
of the, the money
and the profit comes from. It's very
hard to make any money just
on transmission. And I do have a
couple of projects that
are not linked
to generation
that the same company is building.
So
it may not be a one size fits
all approach, but
it's certainly something I can take
back to my team and think about and
talk with the development companies
and see what we can do.
Um Lastly,
there is investment, I believe
it's pattern energy who
is helped to
get the Mesa lands uh
wind technology
program going. Um So
I don't know how, how much support
or how long that went
on, but it was clear that
that um they
needed local uh
workforce development
as part of their
process in being able to
maintain the farms they're building
here. That's, that's all
I have on that, but I'm happy to meet with
you um
at another time to discuss
ideas further, >> Mr
Chair and just on that,
just real quickly,
we need
to the whole, the
keyword here is
leveraging
and we have our tribal
communities in every
part of the
state and there
is an entity,
sovereign energy that
can help leverage
um in, in
the, in this whole
area of expansion
and identifying
um local
um whether
it's local or
tribal
owned
projects
that could
be um
targeted.
And um I understand
you don't do generation, but there
is a direct partnership between
the two obviously.
And so if you can match
the two, but we
often ignore
the strength and the
assets of our tribal
communities and
our tribal
um
willingness to
invest
reinvest from
their capital
projects
into uh
renewable energy
because it be it is
protecting our mother
Earth. And
um it is definitely
of tribal
interest to
protect our planet. So
I would encourage us to
keep
those key
entities in that language.
First and foremost. Thank
you, Mr Chair. >> Thank you very
much. Representative. Thank you to our reader
presenters. I'm gonna go now to
Representative Serato.
>> Thank you Mr Chair. Thank you panelists
and presenters for um for
this information. You know, I, I
definitely agree with Senator
Griggs that uh you know, as much
investment and energy that we
have really positions New
Mexico, well, economically,
um and really for the future
of what energy looks like. I
do see a, all of our,
our energy source are at different
stages of, of their,
of development and of growth
and everything. And so it's, it's wonderful
to see a lot of these updates with the
dates of 2026
2032 and a lot of these
things on the line. One thing I was gonna
ask and I'm sure you've done it a
million times, but I'll, I'll say it
again. Um When you do come
back during the session and other
times that we will see you if
all of these maps of transition
lines can be on one map.
Um That will really help us
visualize that a lot, I think.
Um because I'm, I'm
putting it together like a
like I see my kids do it, you know.
So just to have that it will
help. I think all of us a little bit.
Um You know, I've, I've definitely
seen the maps of, of
uh RT Os and
obviously there's a huge gap
in the West, which is just so disappointing
considering how much renewable
we have. That. That's possible.
And again, getting in once
I know the battery storage
conundrum
is, well, probably keeps
you all up at night. Uh And
I know it's, it's a big deal
but, you know, as we know,
that's where technology is
moving. It is my hope that we
can encourage more RT O
or encourage Western RT
O outside of helpers.
Um I am curious that
you all have a
uh you were talking about
the transmission lines that link to
Arizona. And
from your perspective, how
does that impact
the future of,
of a Western
RT O? You know, do you think
those agreements are completely separate
from those? Um Just how do you see
that being the development? And that's really my only
question,
Chairman,
>> sorry,
uh Representative Serrato
and uh chair for, sorry,
um
on the map from your
lips to God's ears.
Um I'm gonna
put that on our list to see if we can spend
some money and do that.
Um Part
of it is a security issue
and, and you know,
terrorists know where the grid art
is and they know where to target
it. But I mean,
enough of the information is public that,
you know, this isn't hidden
information. We ought to be able to get it all
on one map so that people really
understand where this stuff is. So I'm gonna work
on that
um
on the formation of RT
Os. That's a complicated
topic. Um where
we are right now
is a sort of the
first step in
what that might eventually
look like, which is
the development of
uh day ahead
markets.
KO is
leading an ini initiative
called EAM Extended
Day Ahead Market
and um
PP
Southwest Power Pool is
leading initiative called markets
plus. Um
quite a number of
uh so SPS which is already
part of SP PS system
is in Markets plus
tri-state
um
has already committed to markets
plus the
real
uh
uh interesting
question is which way P and M is
going to go.
Now? Um
I used to be, have the opinion
that it would be bad for New
Mexico to be split down the middle
and be in two different markets
and two different RT Os. And
I'm warming up to
the idea that maybe it isn't
um that we would have the
opportunity if, if different
sections of the state's grid
were interconnected with
different RT Os. And that way
we'd have a, we'd be able to
send New Mexico
energy into both
interconnection systems
and basically nation
we sell New Mexico wind and Solar
nationwide.
Um
So
the
getting smarter
and more uh
relevant
in the discussion
of the
markets, the emerging markets,
which will probably become
the future RT
O footprints
is one of Rita's
priorities.
Um Sunia
and this is public information
has applied to and
has, has
become, it's been
approved by the Kais O
Board to be a, a
participant subscriber.
So that line is going
to be managed by
Kaisa once it's built
under a service
agreement.
And so, I mean, that's another
sort of indicator that,
that we're gonna have
infrastructure interconnected
in both directions and
probably be participating in both
markets and reed is
trying to, I mean,
we don't really have a dog in that fight.
We're trying to be agnostic
um and support the
idea of getting an RT
O in place
because of those benefits.
Um But I can
certainly uh for next
time we come and visit with you
uh beef up our presentation
on, on where, you
know, sort of the state of affairs
in the development of the
RT OS and,
and uh I would
expect by this
time or by the time next
time we give our report to this
committee that PNM will have
decided and we'll be able to
talk with you a bit more about
that.
>> Thank you, Representative. And
I will ask that we truncate our
questions and answers. Uh
Representative
Terrazas.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Um
Yes, sir, I will do
that. Thank you, ma'am for
the ladies, for your
presentation.
Um Love
the conversation we're having here,
Mr Chair.
Um I'm glad
that reinvestment was brought
up and uh
one of those for me was
return on investment, right?
But I think
obviously Mr Chair an hour is
not enough for us to have this
conversation. But
um I see that part
of one of the transition lines, the south
line transmission
goes right to a portion
of my district, uh southwest
of Mexico. And so,
you know what
I'm hearing from
our colleagues here is
not necessarily that we're
against
the diversification
of New
Mexico's
uh energy sector. I don't
think that's the, the, the
or the, the,
I don't think we're having problems with
the diversification of that. I
think, um,
I appreciate
what, um, Representative
Chatfield also said
that in that we
have some issues with, with
private property,
um,
uh, the,
uh, the taking of private
property or, you know, without
going through the proper process.
And I think, um,
I'm very strongly
although I want to see, I'm
not, again, we're not
against this. I, I don't, I don't
want to say that I'm against this because I think
the diversification of
our businesses of, of our state
is very important to have
new jobs and new, new
ways of, of getting
energy. I also
think though very strongly
that it's important to protect
those private properties
owners. The last
thing was, um, Mr
Chair is,
um, we made
some mentions of oil and gas and
so forth and, you know, in my
district, um,
you know, I, I try to explain
this to, to the
constituents in my district that we
have, we're torn apart
with, you know, oil
and gas and its role
and you know how it's bad for the
environment. And
the way I, I tell my,
my constituents in, in
my district is I said,
look, I would prefer
to see a barrel
of oil
produced in
New Mexico
than a barrel
that we because because of our
environmental protections that we
have rather than
another part of the world, even
another part of
our country because
we have better environmental
protections. It's a
cleaner barrel
of oil if you want to call it that
than other areas.
And
furthermore, I
think
oil and gas is such an important
part of our
economy. If
you're against oil and gas in New Mexico,
you're almost against education
in New Mexico if
that makes any sense. And
so I think, um,
for all of us that, that
see the
need for furthering
our, our education budgets and
where that those funds come,
when we look at 66
cents of,
of the, of new money
that came into New Mexico. This last
budget came from oil and
gas. When we look at those things,
we definitely can't,
uh, steer
away from it, but I'm
absolutely in favor of
diversification.
And so this is going to be good for my
district and so forth.
I, um, I
don't want to, I had other
questions, but I think some of them have been
answered and, and I, we could go deeper,
but I, I
wanted to make sure that
we all kind
of, I'm gonna harp on
this again that we all work together
and sometimes we have our differences
of opinion on how to get there,
but I think we could
definitely work
better together and all of us
and on all parts
in, in
um bridging some of these
gaps where we can
move forward
with projects like your own.
Um But the only
real deal that I have with that
is that property, you know, the private
property issue and thank
you for bringing it up. I'm gonna keep it
short, Mr Chair.
Thank you very much. >> Thank you very
much. Representative, I appreciate it, madam,
Vice chair, Representative
Garrett.
>> Thank you Mr Chair. Thank you
both. And I love the fact
that Mariposa's name
is
Mariposa's.
It adds a dimension
to a very technical
discussion. Mr
Chair. I agree with
Representative Serrato about the regional
trans uh
transmission organizations
and future maps.
And my question is
so Texas, as I
understand, it is not part of the
grid. Is,
are there discussions
about that in
the transmission
uh area?
And does Rita
have any part in those
discussions?
>> Uh TPI and
Representative uh uh
Vice Year Garrett.
Um So
Texas is its own country in
terms of the transmission
grid. They, they have, they have an
RT O it's called A CT.
Um but they're,
they have designed
their system to avoid
all federal regulation at,
at FERC. And so,
so they don't
touch
systems outside of
Texas.
Um
We've talked with some
developers, these are
projects that are pretty far down the
line and therefore pretty
confidential in terms of,
you know, sort of
uh every project starts out
as sort of a little bit of a
crazy dream. And so
there's a few of those out there that
are, you know,
probing and how do we
interconnect Texas, but
that's about it in terms of
read disengagement in
that.
>> Uh Thank you. And my second question
is so,
you know, we've, you mentioned
artificial intelligence A
I
um ravenous
appetite for electricity,
obscene potential
use of energy. The
need may double twice.
Is that part
of the discussions
on the need for
um
transmission? It
seems like that almost has
to be as people
locate. Is
it with the
companies you work with, with Rita
itself?
>> Uh Cherty
Vart. Yes,
I mean, it's coming up more and more
and remember A I
became a thing in like less
than the last two years
um in
terms of the
explosive
growth and, and how
smart has it has become
all of a sudden.
Um
And
I'd have to do a little research
on the specifics of this but,
but uh
southeastern New Mexico lost
a data center because SPS
they came to do an interconnection
and they just did not have the
ability to provide the
power and, or the
interconnection.
I think if A I
and its energy appetite keeps
on the way it's been.
Um I think
there's an opportunity there
to hit up
those very large companies who
are making a very large amount
of money to invest
in the infrastructure
they need. It should not be placed
on the backs of, of
the, you know, other
retail and,
and uh large
customers to have
to pay for and develop the
the need for that
and, and that could be very beneficial to
New Mexico to have,
have those uh
that part of the load
pay for infrastructure that benefits
everybody.
>> Uh Thank you, Mr Chair,
if down the
line as
appropriate, if you can update
us on that. And then
my third question is kind of
related to what representative
Roya Cavia brought up. She
brought up geothermal energy
in New Mexico. We have a
company like Cris that's
exp uh exploring
and working with nuclear
fusion, new
low costs uh
not in need of
water. Is
that anywhere
in the discussion
of sources of
energy as
it applies to New Mexico,
specifically
>> chair and Vice
Chair Garrett.
Not so much
yet. I mean, I think
that
hydrogen is a little bit bigger
part of the discussion.
Um That's a
little tricky for
Rita to get involved in because
of the, it's the for
hydrogen comes in many, many
forms and I've looked at our
act when
I had my attorney hat on and I'm
like, oh, I'm not really
sure this is going to be something we
can do. Um
But
in terms of meeting the eta
targets getting to 50%
by 2030 is, is
well within the doable
margin, you get
past that
into the 80%.
It's not,
I mean, there has to be
significant technological
advances between
2030
2040 2045
to reach those goals. And I
think that the
answer has to be a yes
and, but you know,
New Mexico has
a has a very
uh checkered
history with nuclear power.
And I think if, if this
the small reactors are going to
be any part of the
solution that that has to
be um very
carefully approached and
done, right? So that
we don't have
um health and
safety issues and,
and, and
uh large
uh portions
of the New Mexico
uh um
population cultures being
abused and, and
uh and not treated
well.
>> Uh Thank you and I totally
forgot about hydrogen. So
thanks for mentioning that. Thank
you. Those are my questions, Mr
Chair. >> Thank
you very much uh madam, vice
chair and members of the committee. Thank
you to the reader, presenters. I
continue to learn more and more about this,
not my primary swim lane. So
I don't spend a whole lot of time
swimming around in this, but I've
learned a lot. Thank you. Very much
and I apologize to the next
presenters. If I can have that group,
please come to the presentation
table. We were on
track and then we kind of fell off track
and got on track and now we're off track
again.
Yeah. So
um with that, come on up,
I'll draw the committee's attention to
item number nine,
local government planning fund
rules, Michael Vanderheide,
um Managing Director
of Public Programs and Mexico Finance
Authority, Brian Otero Compliance
Officer and Deputy General Counsel,
New Mexico Finance Authority. And
I do want to let the committee know before everyone
takes off if you want to hang
out and get a tour of this wonderful
place. If you haven't already, I think I've toured
it twice. Please meet over
by the wine racks and they will
give you a tour the moment the committee
adjourns today and
if you guys wouldn't mind taking it away. Thank
you, uh Marquita and
company
me to >> go
>> ahead.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman.
Good morning to all. Pleasure
to be here, Michael
Vanderheide, managing director of public
Programs with N MA.
Um And we bring before
you amended and restated
rules for our local government planning
fund. Uh The fund's been
mentioned earlier as it
receives an appropriation from the
P PR F on
an annual basis.
The local government planning Fund was
created in 2002.
It provides grants determined
on a sliding scale
to local governments
and what's changing here. Is
through Senate Bill
216 which was
passed in the 2024 regular
legislative session.
What it did was expanded the use
of the LGF
to include a number of new
planning documents.
Those planning documents are
affordable housing plans,
flood inundation, maps
and archaeological
clearances. And
so what we've done, >> wait a
minute to the presenters. I'm sorry. No,
actually those in the
room we are still acting on rules
today. We are
ok. I'm sorry. I was I need
to correct myself. Can you
grab folks that might have left already?
Please go to the parking lot
and grab them back. Thank you.
Please continue.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman.
So we have proposed rule
changes here for the local government
planning fund. We will give
you a little bit of the highlights of
those. I mentioned the three new planning
documents that will be eligible. Now
from the fund,
we are increasing the maximum
grant award under this
fund from $50,000
to $100,000.
We would like to retain
the maximum of
$100,000 per
24 month period for
entity, but
we will allow for an additional
$100,000 per 24
months for affordable housing plans.
As part of these new
rules,
we're going to be providing
increased grant funding for
entities with local
MS of less than 100% of
the state. Mhi
we'll also be expanding our
local match waivers
that will include planning documents
required to address regulatory
compliance and also
those for affordable housing
needs. Currently, those
local match waivers are available
for projects that cure
urgent needs and
for economic development
plans. Uh The rules
also include new definitions
and clarifications uh
to reflect kind of our
current terminology that
we're using for the program. Uh
We've included those definitions
for those new planning documents
that you'll see in the
rules. Um
as a little bit of an overview
of the program. Uh We
currently provide grants up to
$50,000. We'll change
that to $100,000
per document. That
will be a max.
Uh I mentioned earlier the
24 month period
uh as well as the local
uh match waivers, what we
currently do and what we propose
to do. Um This is a
program that accepts monthly
applications. So it's a very active
program. Uh You'll
see on slide three
over to the right, some of the
eligible plans uh
that you can uh apply
for under this program
mostly uh P er
S asset management plans,
environmental documents,
uh Economic
Development plans, Metro
Metropolitan Redevelopment Act
plans, economic feasibility
studies, things of that nature.
Again, I mentioned the affordable
housing plans, flood
inundation maps and archaeological
clearances being added to the
program. With these new
rules, our
eligible entities are typically
uh municipalities, counties,
mutual domestics, water
associations,
irrigation districts, tribes,
uh Pueblos, really any
political subdivision of the
state would be eligible to
apply.
Excuse
me.
That is correct.
Um Yes,
the rest of the current status it goes
over the local match waivers.
Um I should mention
on slide five.
We've got our L GP F
closings for the last seven
years. Um You can see there
was a little bit of a dip during
the pandemic. Um We
are trying to come back from the
currently, we've got 40
active grants totaling
about 1.9 million.
You'll see a little breakdown on
the right of slide five of
the number of different types of plans.
A lot of preliminary engineering
reports and asset management
plans along with lead
plans
and slide six and
seven is those
40 grants that I just
mentioned totaling 1.9
million. Those are active
grants. Uh I believe
in advance of the committee, we had
provided a memo uh
on June 21st
to the committee.
Um That really outlines what
we just mentioned in this
presentation
and also a red line
copy of the amended and restated
rules. So you can see what's
changing. A lot of the
base criteria is not
changing. But again, just
the highlights of adding those
new plans as eligible
uses of the fund.
And with that, I might see if
Marquita has anything to
mention, >> Mr Chairman,
these are fairly straightforward
rules. We're not making a lot of
changes, they're just to
incorporate really
what Senate Bill 16
did with one of addition,
which is to increase
the maximum a
grant.
And they are unchanged
from when you, when they were mailed
out to a couple of weeks ago,
our board did approve them
at its
June meeting
which was last week. So they
are in the same form. They
approved the same form that's before you
today. And we're happy to stand
for questions. >> Thank
you,
presenters. Do we have
any questions on the proposed
rules? Representative?
And I will, I'm sorry, representative
apologies. We did receive
these several weeks ago. I just want to make sure
there was want to make sure he got out to
you. Well, in advance for some
review. Thank you very much,
Representative
Mr Chair. If appropriate for
discussion purposes, I'd like
to go ahead and move
approval of the
proposed
rules.
We have a motion from Raval
Cleo. Do we have a 2nd
2nd from Senator
Rodriguez? All right. Discussion.
Any discussion at this
time?
Hearing none, all those in favor
say I all
those opposed
motion carries.
You have anything else
for the good of the order?
Ok. Thank you to everyone
that ran out and ran back in again,
run out again.
I'm gonna hold on a
second. I'm gonna defer to our committee
director to talk about the next meeting and
then we'll
adjourn
>> Mr chair members of the
committee. The
next meeting will be held in
Gallup on
a
uh Mr chair members of
the committee. The next meeting will be
held in Gallup
in August on the
12 and 13.
Um, I'm still,
I'm working with Representative
Lundstrom to sort out a
location, but
I'll be sending that probably
in the next week or so to
everybody. Um,
and the meetings will begin at
nine o'clock as usual.
>> Thank you, Sabina. We will meet,
uh, starting at nine o'clock and I did
get word by the way from Representative
Lundstrom that a location has
been located.
Uh We'll get that to you as soon
as possible with the street address and all
that come over, show up with
bells on and have a great time. I expect
to see you young man at that meeting.
Ok. All right.
Um Any other
questions, comments for the good of
the order? All right, we'll stand in recess.
Thank you. Thanks for everything
guys. Yeah.
