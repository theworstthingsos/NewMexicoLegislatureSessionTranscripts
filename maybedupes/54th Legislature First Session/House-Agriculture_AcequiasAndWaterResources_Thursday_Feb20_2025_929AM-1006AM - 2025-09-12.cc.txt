Madam Chair, um.
Committee members, I didn't
introduce myself properly. I
should have also said that I'm a
registered lobbyist and
president of the New Mexico
Water Advocates.
My only comment is there are
numerous bills in this
legislature.
That would appropriate tens of
millions.
brackish water and other dirty
water, there is very little
support.
And the legislature to take care
of the water that we already
have.
We're going to face a 750,000

And we won't make that up.
By cleaning up dirty water, we
have to do the best we can.
Manage our water and conserve.
And these three laws, which are
very good.
Will help us solve the problem.
But the agencies cannot do their
jobs.
Thank you so much for that.
Are you ready for
public comment. OK, thank you.
We're gonna go to support in the
room first and then we'll go to
the zoom, so raise your hands on
Zoom if you're in support of
this bill, um, has 423.
Um, yep, go ahead.
You raise your hand if you and
if you'd like to speak.
OK, great.
Um, we will hold the mic. Well,
I won't hold the mic.
Mike will be held for you.
Great.
Hi, my name is Jennifer
Bradfield, and I am a member of
the Water Advocates. I'm a
resident in Bernalillo County
from Albuquerque, New Mexico,
and funding for these programs
is absolutely needed in New
Mexico. We need regional water
planning, and we need to pay
attention to our freshwater
resources. When we talk about
brackish and industrial water
uses. It's always within the
mindset that fresh water needs
proper attention and funding for
all of our precious freshwater
use.
Thank you.
Thanks for that.
Um, I'm not sure if I said it
was a minute, but it's a minute.
Good morning, Madam Chair and
committee members. My name is
Ruth Striegel. I am the co-chair
of the board of directors of
New.
I have lived in New Mexico for
over 40 years. I have seen water
levels in the Rio Grande go
down. I have seen how we get
less and less water.
I am
Very worried that ants our
population increases and we have
less water and more heat.
We are working ourselves into an
untenable situation where life
becomes less livable.
In our state and
Madam Chair and members of the
committee. Uh, my name is Steven
Fry. I'm a policy and project
specialist with Amigos Bravos.
um,
we're based in Taos in New
Mexico since 1988. Um, we are a
social got an organization
guided by social justice
principles dedicated to
preserving and restoring the
ecological and cultural
integrity of New Mexico.
We support House Bill 423
because we believe it allocates
resources for assessing and
addressing the state of our
water resources in New Mexico,
where they will be most
effective and how we can
collaborate.
We need to have an accurate
picture of what our water
resources are in order to make
the most effective decisions
about addressing the scarcity of
our future.
Therefore, we need aquaphor
mapping and we need active and
funded regional water planning
councils and two-way
communication between state
agencies and university
scientists and community dealing
with dwindling water resources.
Thankfully, the state has
already passed, um, a number of
bills addressing these issues,
such as the 2023 water Security
Planning Act.
Uh, my name's Kathy Economy. I'm
a retired hydrologist, and I've
worked on multiple projects
throughout my career from, uh,
dealing with nuclear waste,
mining, um, permitting mining,
cleaning up contaminated waste.
In our groundwaters and working
on those jobs, I've really hated
process to find out where
potable water is. It's not just
an even surface under the ground
there's hills, there's valleys
and aquifers.
We need to restore our water to
get potable water for.
future generations, we need to
fund.
The state engineer's office,
the, uh, all, all the
professionals that monitor where
our water is and how to get it.
To us, the community and to not
just uh us to.
Um
Um, bios, the biosphere lance.
Thank you, Madam Chair. My name
is Mali Maduno.
Consultant to the North Central
Council of Governments and in
the last 5 years I have directly
assisted many mutual domestics
and other local rural
communities with water problems,
HB 423 is very important.
To funding the continued effort
of regionalization of the system
management and system
development for rural
communities. Uh, you're just to.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee, Debbie Hughes
with the Association of
Conservation Districts. The soil
and water conservation District
strongly support this bill, uh,
when we had 16 planning regions,
the soil and water districts
were fiscal agents or managers
of many of these, so we look
forward to working with the
state, uh, on the, the 9 new
planning areas and uh we also
strongly support uh funding for
water data because we really
can't plan without all of that
information. Thank you.
Hey
Morning, madam Chair and members
of the committee, I'm LaDonna
Clayton. I'm from Clovis, New
Mexico. And I'm the executive
director of the Ogallala Land
and Water Conservancy. I am a
water ambassador. I'm also on
the board of the water
advocates, and I played a
pivotal role in the eastern New
Mexico no landscape designation,
which covers quay, part of quay,
curry, and Roosevelt counties
and here's what I know these 3
management programs are
absolutely vital to our future.
I cannot emphasize that enough.
I personally living the
importance of water data and
water planning for my side of
the state, aquifer mapping plays
a key role in what we do and
understanding how much water
remains. We cannot move forward
if we don't understand water
supply, what the water sources
are, what is our water portfolio
without the regional water
planning without the planning,
we cannot move forward with the
vision that's necessary to
execute important actions. So
thank you so much.
for her full support of HB 423.
you.
Anyone else in the room? Oh.
Chairman, members, my name is
Robinson Kurth. I'm a resident
of Santa Fe.
Um, born and raised here, you
see that water's more of an
issue and like people have
mentioned already, it sounds
like there's proper
collaboration with something
like this. Everyone's always
wanting funding, but this seems
like a proper funding, proper
collaboration so that we do have
the data and information to to
make proper plans and so full
funding would probably be very
helpful, I know that there's
always a need for, you know,
Some of the money, but
This would be an important one
for our state and people.
Thanks.
Thank you. Anyone else in the
room and support?
We're gonna move to Zoom.
Uh, please raise your hand if
you are in support. You have one
minute.
Um,
with you're on Zoom, uh, I will
ask you to unmute yourself and
when you unmute yourself, your
time will begin. So first up we
have Barbara.
Good morning, Madam Chair and
committee members. I'm Barbara
Cali, registered lobbyist for
the League of Women Voters of
New Mexico. The league is in
strong support of HB 423
We believe that the creation and
adherence to comprehensive water
budgets is essential to preserve
public lands, water, and open
space and to ensure that there
will be enough water for future
generations of New Mexicans. The
league supports continued
funding for regional planning
using
a public process, regional
planning should gather and
publish data on supply and
demand and provide regular
updates, create a balanced water
budget, identify critical and
emerging issues. Passage of HB
423 is necessary to accomplish
those goals. Please vote for a
due pass. Thank you very much.
Thank you. And next up we have
Indivisible Albuquerque.
Can you hear me?
Yes we can hear you. Thank you.
OK. Thank you so much.
My name is Sandra Salberg, and
I, oh, hold on.
Sandra, we lost you. Can you
start over again?
Sure. Can you hear me now?
Thank you so much. My name is
Sandra Stalberg, and I am uh
representing indivisible
Albuquerque. Um, thank you so
much for taking our comments
today. Uh, we believe in
spending our tax dollars wisely
and funding the state agencies
to do the work that they've been
charged to do. We believe in
following the science, and we
want to ask you respectfully to
do a um to vote yes on this
bill, um, because we want to
protect our water. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Next up we
have Cheryl.
Hello, my name is Cheryl, and I
am calling in support of this
bill, we certainly do need clean
water. I'm sorry, I'm not um
knowledgeable enough to
understand exactly what they're
gonna spend $30 million on over
a two year period, but we
definitely need to preserve and
take care of our water and keep
it clean. Thanks so much.
Thank you, Cheryl. Next up we
have Patty.
Patty, uh, if you.
Unmute yourself, your public
comment will begin.
not, you may have to
OK, uh, Madam Chair, thank.
Hey, if you are in opposition to
this bill, please raise your
hand.
No opposition in the room, uh,
anyone on Zoom in.
Madam Chair, we have no members
on opposition on Zoom.
We'll, we'll go back to the
sponsor briefly before we go to
questions. Thank you, Madam
Chairman, um, defer to my
expert.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee.
There was a public comment that
said they
Uh, public commenters said they
didn't know how this money would
be spent.
Um, as to the regional water
planning money.
There are 9 regional water
planning councils that the
Interstate Stream Commission has
just designated.
Um
They each need an initial grant.
To get themselves organized.
Um, to hire staff.
You can't do planning without
staff.
Uh, to retain technical
consultants and to prepare a
work plan.
And after the Interstate stream
commission approves the work
plan.
They need funding to do the
work.
In my estimate is that the
regional water planning program
statewide will
Um
If done right and it has to be
done right.
It is going to be around $80
million to get it completed.
So this would be a down payment.
This is the only money, I mean,
the only purpose of this money
is grants to regions.
It was the will of the
legislature to give the regions.
More autonomy
Um
My amendments uh to the uh water
Security Planning Act, which
passed unanimously.
But there's not yet any money
for the region with regard to
the Water Data Act.
Um, compliance.
The job that the agencies have
to do is directing agencies is
just huge.
Um
They can't
Readily find their own data to
use it in analyses, rounding up
data within the agency to do
work as a major task.
And that data ends up on
somebody's spreadsheet.
Instead of being available to
the public in the whole.
Um, and the whole agency.
And um without the water data.
The Interstate stream Commission
cannot comply.
With the requirement of the
Water Data Act that um I'm
sorry, the water Security
Planning Act.
That the interstate stream
commission furnished the data to
the regions for use in planning.
Thank you.
Thank you for that. We're gonna
go to questions, represent the
Pettigroup.
And
Uh, no,
actually just didn't hear the, I
heard the representative part. I
just didn't hear the second one.
Um
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you, Representative for
bringing the bill.
Had my questions lined out, but
I need clarification now from
your
Um
Expert
I think the last statement I
heard was without.
The 30 million.
We can't comply.
With
The Water security Planning Act,
which is actually the bill that
we're talking about.
Would that be correct?
Um, Madam Chair, uh,
Representative Pettigrew, um,
this bill covers 3 acts.
The water security Planning Act,
the Water Data Act.
And a statute that is compiled
at um in the state engineer
powers.
Um
That is the origin of the active
water resources management
program, which is so badly
needed in the middle Rio Grande
to avoid a compact violation.
Because the middle Rio Grande is
using water that belongs to the
lower Rio Grande in large
amounts.
Um, so there are 3 bills.
Uh, I'm sorry, there are 3
pieces.
Thank you very much, Madam
Charon. Thank you for that
answer.
Cause I was like, I really feel
like we're making some changes,
but that's already clarify a few
things.
Thank you.
And I'm sure that's the reason
why I don't let them write my
Labels so um.
Madam Chair and Representative.
I struggled in reviewing this to
find all of the funding inside
of House Bill 2. And my
struggling because it's not
there, or am I struggling cause
I can't find it.
Madam Chair represented
Pettigrew. This money is not in
House Bill 2.
It's not in the LFC
recommendation. It was not in
the governor's recommendation.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you, Representative and,
and witness for that.
So through the, the whole
concepts of section 5 through
section 11.
Representative, you weren't able
to get anything in there to help
assist with
House 423. Is that correct? Bill
got the a little late, but we
are working. I am, I'm.
I am trying with uh Senator
Woods. He is my buddy, so.
We're trying to get them
something in the OK. Um,
So just
To be crystal clear with
everybody.
It's some funding is not in
House Bill 2 and Hospital 2 will
be negotiated in appropriations,
probably tomorrow.
Um, and on the floor within the
next 3 to 4 days after that.
2 to 4 days after that.
This bill doesn't move forward
out of approach.
And so,
And it won't continue to move
forward.
On the Senate side unless
You're able to get that money in
there.
In my, am I correct in that?
Thank you.
Madam Chair and Representatives,
there's things inside of here I
don't like.
I'm not gonna stop it from
getting to a probes.
Actually, I'm pretty sure I
couldn't stop it from getting to
a purpose if I wanted to, but
um.
The
One of the biggest concerns from
this.
is the OSC's concerned that
A timeline of 2 years, Madam
Chair and Representative.
They can't meet it.
There's no way that they can get
everything in line.
Within 2 years.
Inside their
Report.
So Madam chair and
representative, I would suggest
maybe having a little bit longer
conversation with.
With
From that, from that side of the
legislation and maybe come up
with a way that.
I, I don't see anything that
says they, they're completely in
opposition to this, they're just
saying that we can't.
So that does create a concern
with respect to that.
Um, Madam Chair Representative,
you know how I feel about
continual reauthorizations and
that concerns me if we were able
to throw this into a
non-recurring.
That only had a one year time or
a 2 year timeline on it.
Um, we then go into another
conversation with the new
executive in 2027.
That may not support.
Um, that reauthorization as
well. But there are some
concerns with it within that.
Just
With respect to carrying it to
the next executive.
Whoever that is, and the fact
that.
Um, that next executive may have
a different concept on who's on
those planning councils.
Those are my concerns within the
logistics of the bill.
The other pieces that are in
there are just my personal
issues and, and that's not.
With respect to the logistics.
So I do appreciate your time.
Thank you Pettigrew
there are further questions,
Representative Matthews.
Thank you, Madam Chair. um.
Thank you.
Representative and norm.
Um, I'm.
Looking at the fur, I'm just uh.
I had a couple of questions.
So what happened is we had 3
bills.
That were passed.
And they had no appropriation in
them to fund the work that.
Madam Chair Representative
Matthews, no.
The water security Planning Act
tasked with a $500,000.
Appropriation and I think they
had another $500,000 this year.
That doesn't provide the funding
that they need to um.
To, to give to the regions to do
the work. OK, so, so Madam
chair.
Represented representatives
there has been some funding.
But it has been an inadequate
amount. Is that?
What's happened.
Madam Chair, um.
Representative Mr.
so.
Where is the office of State
Engineer on this.
And are they in is the office
state engineer in support of
your bill?
This.
I'm not sure if she's in in
support but.
only can ask for so much money
and
um
so uh.
Madam Chair, this is kind of we
can.
Generate some dollars for them
and then they'll they'll spend
it. Is that what we're, we're
doing?
We are trying to
support our water. I'm sorry,
it's OK.
Madam Chair.
Oh, OK, uh.
Madam Chair, uh, representative,
I was just asking whether.
Whether what we're we're trying
to do with this appropriation or
these are we trying to basically
provide the money to the OSC,
the uh the um state engineer to
the extent they're involved.
And
Hoping they spend it or do we
know that you're gonna use this
money.
Madam Chair Representative
Matthews, um,
I believe that they will do the
best they can to spend the money
productively. They have great
needs. They know that.
Um, what their FIR basically
says is they don't have the
staff to spend the money.
Um, the the two large
appropriations are for 3 years.
Um, and
The situation is that nobody is
stepping up.
To recognize the water crisis
that we have.
And it's a crisis because if we
continue the status quo.
We don't have much of a water
future in this state we.
Things move slowly in the water
world, and we have to take
action.
So all of these um initiatives
were recommended by the 2022
water policy and infrastructure
task force, which
I was fortunate enough to serve
on, um.
The state engineer and Doctor
LaDonna Clayton.
And myself, uh, we're co-chairs.
Of the work group that came up
with the recommendations.
For all of these, and I've
listed in the brochure.
The specific Water Task Force
recommendations that they relate
to.
Somebody has to take the lead in
speaking up for clean water and
to date.
Um, we don't hear very very many
voices for that.
And so
I'm here
To urge you to fund the agencies
to take care of our water,
please.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Norm. I, we, you and
I have talked about this before.
Um
I'm just
Wondering if.
Well, let me ask another
question, do you, this is, this
is, these are separate bills, so
at some point, the governor
would also have to sign off on
the East Coast.
Yeah, and so, uh, Madam Chair
Representative, do we know?
Is the governor willing to sign
off on these appropriations? OK.
Uh
I'm sure, um.
Thank you. I, you know, I
appreciate how it's gonna
happen.
And I appreciate and I, I, and I
appreciate your.
Effort here at
I have
pushing this on.
Um, very much. And
I, I would move a due pass
unless there are other
questions. There are other
questions.
Madam Chair, thank you, um.
I carried the water Security
Planning Act along with list of
products in 20023, so I totally
get what you're talking about
and at the time was with the
state engineer, it was get it
in, get it in statute so that we
at least have something to work
that one.
That was the idea.
And, and so I, I fully support
what you're trying to do. I
know, I think I think point.
You're never gonna get 63
million, but
You know,
There is, I know, 17 million
left in there, and that's what
you need. I would push for
recurring at the appropriations
because, and that, you know,
200,000 about.
A year to at least that, but
you've got, I think you have to
come with uh if you come with 66
million, it will blow everybody
out of the water, no pun
intended, but um.
I, I just think we ought to do
it that way. So I will work with
you and I get 2 million in
recurring funding.
Out of that 17 million, you got
to know everybody, but I think
it's important. I know it's
important and I think, I think
these regional districts office
could do a lot with two people
because they won't do it by
themselves. So bring in the
agencies and they'll bring in
all the, all, and, and I think
it's important, so I'll work
with you on that. I, I.
Won't support this bill, uh, no,
I guess I have to support this
bill so we can move it forward.
So I will, I will support this
bill, but I want to change it
drastically, but um.
OK, that's all I have to say,
Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative
Herrera, uh, I wanna make an
editorial comment before we
Um, go for. I wish, I wish it
were in the budget. It's so
critical. It takes money and
capacity to do the work that
we're requiring of these
agencies so that we can secure
water, um, that we don't have
this in the budget and, you
know, I would like to do
whatever I can to help so that
we can.
Do the work that we've signed
into law. So with that,
I move a do pass.
Hey, uh, we have a do pass
motion.
Go ahead and call the roll.
Representative Herrera.
Representative Lara Kadena.
Representative Matthews.
Representative Moya.
Yes.
Yeah
Representative Rubio.
Yes
Ranking members Zamora
um.
And Madam Cha Ortiz.
Yes.
You have
unanimous, uh, do pass on house
bill 423.
You, Madam.
Thank you.
Um, we're gonna
Take a moment, but really just a
moment for the sponsor of the
next bill to.
Come into the room. Someone can
get him.
