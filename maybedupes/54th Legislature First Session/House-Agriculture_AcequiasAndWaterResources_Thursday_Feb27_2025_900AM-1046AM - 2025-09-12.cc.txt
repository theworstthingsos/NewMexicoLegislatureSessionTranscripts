OK.
Thank you for hearing
uh how
to
uh in our.
I'll
let my group
have any water, OK? Uh, they go
out and see what's wrong with
it
maybe a planning
and then they may get the
engineering to do it
they are.
an
honest
and then they say, OK, this is
what's going on with you
you know you have a leaky
and I'm a member of the
committee that
5 years ago.
now,
you know,
I'm gonna see if
we can get it in because
I I always um
immunity in Connor.
Madam Chair.
Thank you for allowing me.
Uh, I,
I am with my
technical
training
for the water
and things like that so we
pretty much
training.
Training
their hands on technical
assistance.
When we get a call and then if
if, if, if or
or uh
something bad happens.
Uh,
the hands on the field
we go out and
deal with
these
Uh, the hands on the field
we go out and
deal with
the problems arising again.
Um, they'll they'll be able to
take care of themselves
to come
from somewhere else.
Uh, last year I had.
Um
C.
That's 3 people for the whole
community.
Uh,
uh, people to cover that, uh,
last year they
They, uh
Directly helped uh about 11,070.
Systems
Which is, you know, obviously
more than the number systems,
but going back to some, but,
but, uh
That's not very many contacts,
1175 out of 600 and some public.
Or community water systems in
the, in a full year's time. Um.
So this.
The, uh, we also provide, you
know, board board training and,
and, and assistance with funding
and
And organizational issues and,
and uh.
And that type of thing. So, uh,
in addition to us, uh.
The RCAC.
And uh Southwest Environmental
Finance Center.
Um
Also worked with, with public
water systems, uh, primarily in
the in the finance and
operational types of trainings.
Uh
Between all of us with what
we're doing now, we cover the
state as best we can.
But there's not enough people.
Uh, with boots on the ground to
cover the state. This, this will
be a good, a good start to try
to help get more people out
there to help alleviate the
issues that we do have in the
communities and, and help train
those people more and and get
and get more people in the
communities at at a point where
they can, uh,
Uh, operate better.
Uh
More effectively and more
efficiently in their own
communities, which will help the
state as well.
Thank you.

Uh, I'm the chairman of the New
Mexico Seca Commission, and I am
full support of this bill. It is
important to define acaements.
This will help in clarifying
importance of being apaiante.
Which is a landowner that has
the right to water.
And that we abide by the bylaws
that we already have approved by
the community

From the committee
Thank you, thank you, Madam
Chair, and thank you, uh,
representative for the
presentation and, and, uh.
And Mr.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your
name, but.
Conor.
OK, great. Thank you.
Um
I was reading about this last
night and
The the strangest thing was I
was looking at the analysis.
And the first document I picked
up was a response from a talking
about a $1 billion.
Tiff
Um, you know, one of those
things.
And I thought, well, this is
going to be a heck of a water
issue.
I don't know that anybody else
Oh, that's OK I just looked at
it, OK.
Well, I just noted that in
passing that that it certainly
got my attention.
Um,
So then I realized as I went to
the place, um, but what I did
find interesting in the was that
um the analysis were frequently
questioned the
The appropriateness and the and
the need for this.
But in different ways. So, uh,
the key thing that I had
questions about was.
Uh, apparently NMED has a
drinking water bureau.
And the purpose of the drinking
water bureau is to do the kind
of work that Mr. Connor was
describing.
Um, and a number of the
Documents analyzing this thought
that first of all,
why, why are we calling it a
pilot project if we're already
doing this, so that would be my
uh, Madam Chair, and, uh,
Matthews for calling, uh,
because it's their work, so
given the and, and I just want
to answer. I, I agree it
probably should go and then, and
I will be happy to make that
amendment by the time we get to
the next committee. So I, I
actually agreed with that. I
you know, you do a bill and
comes out and you go, oh yeah,
that looks good. And then if
somebody has a better idea, so,
uh, I will be fully, I will be
making that amendment, but I
would like to.
Uh, Madam Chair, uh,
Representative, thank you for
that because that, that was a
lot of my concern. It just
seemed like people kind of
stepping over each other, trying
to make this happen, um, I did
have one other question though,
um.
Let me get past the fairgrounds.
Ah. Here to try to read my
writing.
And I, I was, I was a little
curious about the funding, Madam
Chair and Representative.
Um, is there already money?
This would be an additional uh
appropriation or is there
already money?
In the budget
Through New Mexico ED.
To do this.
And share uh Matthew Snow.
you know.
And, uh, Madam Chair
Representative, uh.
We're talking about $900,000.
OK.
And that would
Allow that would be spent over 3
years.
The problem is if we did a bill
one year, I,
I, I gave the capital outlay and
then by the time, you know, in
July.
The
DFA was slow, and by the time
they got the, you know, the
contract.
Uh, it was, it was almost
September and you can't hire
somebody for 3 months and then
uh, you know, so that's why I
did it over a 3 year period so
there can be some continuity so
that when they hire somebody,
they can have train them, get
them out in the field and uh
have them um do the job for 3
years. This is not a one year
job.
Uh, man chair representative, I,
I understand, I can imagine it's
a huge amount of work to do this
over a period of time, but
What I'm a little confused about
is.
So
They have New Mexico Environment
Department has a drinking water
bureau. They have some funding
apparently for that.
And if you're going to amend the
bill to put this under that.
Um, is that
That's going to mean, or let me
ask you, Madam Chair,
Representative, that's going to
mean that we're going to be able
to do more of this.
And so how much
Total money
They must have some funding for
this already.
You know they do
I'll get back to you later with
that. It's not enough, I can
tell you we have underfunded
environment for years, and
certainly, and that's why the
drinking water bureau has to
rely because they don't have the
circuit riders. Well, he does
the whole state and so does
RCAC. So, so it's ever who has
the circuit rider that can get
they have the funding to do
that.
Um, they depend on these agents.
Madam Chair Representative,
thank you. So if I'm
understanding what's going to
happen is there'd be an
amendment to put this under the
drinking water bureau, and then
the drinking water bureau would
essentially contract with these
and supplement what they're
doing, but under their
direction.
OK. All right. Thank you very
much.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
and, and, uh, representative,
thank you for
Walking us through this.
Did
Was there originally money in
the growth fund that that
ultimately found its way out of
the girlfri.
I'm just curious, Madam Chair,
because of the way it's phrased.
Uh, Madam Chair and
Representative, no. I, you know.
I didn't think to say and I just
decided to go for it. I, I, you
know, it's a Hail Mary pass.
What can I tell you? Uh, but I,
I think it would be a good
expenditure of public money and
that, and I think it will, it
will really provide a service.
That's why I brought it forward.
Madam Chair and Representative.
If this was
A good idea and some process
that.
We needed to have.
What's kept this from happening
in the past?
Why has an NMED push this, Madam
Chair and Representative.
In their past
I think
my opinion, Madam Chair and rep,
I think NMED has been
underfunded for years.
And they just have been and uh I
guess that's our collective
fault that we haven't put more
money in, uh, but, but, uh, now
that we're doing this kind of
full court press on water
infrastructure. I think this is,
I think it will add to the
solution in rural communities
like yours.
I chair and representative, I, I
appreciate your feelings with
respect to underfunding enemy D.
I can go back and show the
environment department.
Redirecting
Repurposing things.
Um
They still continue, Madam
Chair, to the struggle with
filling the uh physicians every
year that we ask them to give.
To go get.
Instead of doing.
This, we, we re-task them.
So we
Of a lack of funding is not the
issue.
Proper direction maybe.
From the legislature and
diverging.
Rights may be part of the issue,
uh, that they have to deal with
from this body.
Adam Chair right now.
I would
Suggest
And there may be other debate.
So we roll the bill and, and we
address.
A Representative Matthews.
Concerns and then readdress this
with the committee.
Then
Uh, we have one more question.
No.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative. I really
love this bill and, and I really
appreciate you bringing it
forward and, and to the concerns
of putting it under um the
drinking water bureau. I mean, I
think it's.
Very appropriate to just send it
off to the next committee, but
one of the questions that I had,
um, and it's mostly common and
you all may have heard about it,
but in Sunland Park this last
year, early last year, um, our,
there were violations issued by
the uh by the drinking water,
um, bureau actually regarding um
the uh the what we call rua,
it's the Camino Real Regional
Utility Authority, who faced
several violations around the
drinking water in Sunland Park
and there were a lot of
communities, a lot of the
community who um have been
working really hard over the
course of the last year to
address these issues and um and
so I guess my question is, is
how would this bill, um,
providing all of the, the
necessary investments in in in
what you're trying to do.
Could help the bureau as we move
it in into that area to be able
to address some of the issues
that arose with, with CRA, Madam
Chair and rep, I'm a little out
of range here with my knowledge
among different boards of mutual
domestic water associations and
gonna be responsible for who. So
I, I think that was an unusual
those um mutual domestics are
fund, so they have another set
of money that they can reach,
um, but that's my understanding.
I, I think that was an unusual
political.
and, and you've got to remember
these uh mutual domestic water
association they are political
governmental and entities, and
they elect their own boards,
etc. etc. so that's what I know
about that, that's the only
case, uh, mostly it's people who
just their water systems are
broken down and they need.
Madam Chair, thank you,
Representative, and, and I only
raised that it feel like this is
the sort of bill that I think we
need to be able to provide
further investments in in
agencies like these because
there are a lot of issues that
many rural communities face, and
so, um, that was the reason that
I brought up that particular
that um example is because I
feel like there are a lot of
folks in rural areas that feel
very hopeless.
And powerless and so when you're
able to provide another tool, I
think, especially when it comes
to water systems and access to
drinking water.
That's safe. Like I think that,
um, I just wanted to to raise
that, um, and also just to say
that I, that I very much support
your bill and, and, and I really
urge the.
You, Madam Chair, members of the
committee and, and
representative for bringing this
bill forward.
I too, everything I read is
duplicative.
We're, we're duplicating
services that are already out
there.
And I, I like your intent.
Uh
And, and Madam Chair, would it
be proper for me to ask if you
Or where are we?
Uh, representative
Somewha uh, I think we can move
this bill along and make those
changes before it goes to
appropriations, which I think is
where it's going next.
And, and
if, if you don't roll your bill,
uh, representative, well then.
I, I would make a motion to do a
a due pass with no
recommendation.
If, if that would be proper,
Madam Chan. Uh, you're, you're
representing, you're welcome to
make that motion. I don't know
if it's going to pass,
um, that way the bill could move
forward and it could get fixed
and I don't think you need to do
that, um, when we have to, we
want to have a change to the
bill, um.
But it's really up to you.
Anybody can make a motion that
they want to make.
I make a motion to pass with no
re.
There needs to be a second. We
have a due pass with no
recommendation on HB.
482.
Take the role
Representative Herrera? No.
Representative Laura Kadena.
Representative Matthews.
I'm gonna pass.
That's a, that's a thank you.
OK, uh, Representative
Pettigrew.
Yes
Representative Rubio? No.
Ranking members of Mora.
Madam Vice Chair Kate. No.
Madam Cha Ortiz.
Go back to Matthews.
Representative Representative
Matthews? No.
Oh
Representative mayor of Moya.
You have a, uh, a 4 to 5 on the
Du pass with no wreck.
So that motion has failed. It's
failed. Go ahead, Representative
Rubio. Madam Chair, I move would
you pass, we have a do pass
motion on the table
representative Rubio I represent
Gates.
Representative for.
Yes.
Representative Matthews.
Yes.
Representative Moya.
Representative Pettigrew.
No, and I'd like to explain my
book.
Representative Rubio.
Yes.
Ranking members of Mara? Yes.
Madam Vice chair Keats.
Yes.
Adam Chero
Uh, you have a do pass motion um
by 7 to 1 on House Bill.
482, uh, Representative
Pettigrew to explain his vote.
Madam Chair, maybe it's just me,
but it seems like every time I
present a bill, they want me to
have it fixed before it leaves
the committee. We have the
opportunity to do that here.
We chose not to.
Um
It does create a need for
funding.
That is not in the budget and
Will not, and it creates a
3-year pilot project.
The, um, we'll make it difficult
to go through, so I would have
rather fix the bill here.
Then send it down to let it be
somebody else's problem. Thank
you.
OK, uh, we are on to the next
bill, House Bill 502.
Thank you.
Uh, thank you, uh, Madam Chair,
and Kim 502.
Uh, before they really came up
from um a constituents in it and
it affected, I had two stories
that had happened to me last
year where, where people had
bought homes again, I, I have,
I'm in a very rooms and um one
woman was told that.
That she had uh she had uh the
owner said, you know, they'd
always use that ditch and, and
she bought it for farming.
Uh, she built a, uh, this the
right way, and then
Uh, you can't, and she was
fixing this stitch so that she
could.
You don't have access to that
ditch, those rights, those
property rights were sold in you
do not have rights to that ditch
and uh and she had bought this
farm assuming that she had the
rights and uh and then farming
from a well, at least she didn't
do that, so.
and we resolved it, uh, she
ended up going and buying water
rights so that she could do drip
irrigation to her, you resolve
that, but the fact was she
didn't know. And then I had
another.
Another young man who bought a a
a this kid had grown up on a se,
you know, he was a mir do. He, I
mean, he wasn't a Madomo, but he
was the head of the, you know,
the ditch cleaning operation,
knew a lot about Aseus, and he
assumed again that because he
didn't and he told me, well, I
got in a fight with the Meyer
Doma. I said, oh no, you did the
wrong thing, you know, he didn't
understand that, so anyhow, um,
says, you know, prior to the
seller shall disc.
to the Byrons in any water
rights associated with the
property and, and I want to
explain in rural counties that's
not a 2 hour drive to the county
seat in TA.
So I once went over there to
find out about a water and the
person, you know, I didn't think
to call ahead, only to find out
the person that was in that day.
You know, she was at a meeting
in Albuquerque, so I, you know,
so that was a 5 hour trying to
find somebody at the county uh
all and understaffed. That's
just a reality of how it is, so
And think would you like to see
a few you have to turn your mic
on and please address the chair.
Thank you. Thank you. My name is
Lin Summers. I live in Tow,
Mexico. I am a um a participant
uh Sante and one of the ditches
in Arroyo Hondo. I moved to town
in 1984, uh, about 20 years deep
into my participation in the um
in the uh aa a person showed up
in one of the meetings and said,
uh I moved here from New.
Jersey and um
I don't understand what this
word is I don't understand
Asaka, I don't know how to spell
it, um, but I bought a piece of
property and I'm informed I owe
$3000 and I've owned the
property for a few years and.
Um
I listened to that and I said uh
something's not right here, uh,
a person who buys a piece of
property should no material
facts before they engage in a
transaction, they should know
what they're buying.
And I uh at the time uh later on
uh I was a lobbyist for the
Realtors Association of New
Mexico. I said on the title
insurance advisory panel for 9
years for the PRC and it turned
out nobody's responsible for
disclosing or for offering
information to a prospective
buyer about what they're
getting, um, and so I said
somebody needs to so the term of
art is material.
fact and the real estate law
requires a broker to disclose
material facts in transactions.
Now material of a real estate
broker can also say look, I just
don't know they can disclaim as
opposed to disclose, but there
is an issue here you need to be
advised that you need to
investigate this further.
The title companies in addition
do not ensure a safety rights.
This is a thorny issue they're
in business to make money and
it's very difficult to nail down
some of the details of these I
talked to Gene, uh, Trujillo
with Tierra title yesterday, she
said, I tell people about it all
the time, and I said, but you're
not required to and she said
that's right, I'm not required
to. I just do it because I was
born here.
And I understand that people
need to know this, so instead of
an adversarial relationship
where somebody doesn't know what
they bought, doesn't know they
owe money this bill sets it up
so that when they walk in,
they're welcomed as a willing
participant.
In a community that goes back
for hundreds and hundreds of
years that is a communal
communal situation where
everyone shares in the water for
everyone's benefit and they
accept the responsibilities that
go along with it and they're
fully aware of what those are.
So this bill is attempt to do
this. I wrote this bill 20 years
ago and gave it to senator
Cisneros, unfortunately, he said
this is a great bill, but he
passed before we could get it
done and so only 20 years later.
Uh, I would urge you to pass
this. It's, I think, in
everybody's interest and so if
you have any questions, I'll be
glad to do my best to answer
them. Thank you. Thank you. I
understand that there's a
committee sub. Can you read out
that number for us?
Madam Chair, I'll move for.
Great. OK, so we're going to
discuss that committee sub.
We're going to go to um the
public. If you are in favor.
Please raise your hand if you'd
like to speak. OK, great. And
keep your hands up if you'd like
to speak and we'll bring the mic
to you, please, uh, do not touch
the mic. We'll be holding the
mic for you. Give one minute.
Uh, Madam Chair, members of the
committee, uh, thank you for the
opportunity to speak on behalf
of 502.
My name is Alfredo Montoya. I'm
a member of the New Mexico Ase
Commission, and I'm also a
I saw a chair, and the New
Mexicose Association.
I, I'm the president of the
Regional Association and the
president of our.
My local.
And um
I like to speak about something
a little different than what's
been discussed before.
And just say that this bill will
go a long way in
Educating new landowners.
That acquired property with a
sewa rights and their
responsibilities.
It will prevent
Many misunderstandings regarding
Osea.
These mean in the statutory
historic rights,
the uh when having to go through
someone's property to do
maintenance and repairs on the
Ose.
It also seems like it would add
a really small burden.
To the items that have to be
disclosed by realtors.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. Thank
you.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Vidal
Gonzalez and I work for the New
Mexico Secchi Association as the
director of policy and planning.
I'm a registered lobbyist, and
I'm here to speak in support of
Hospital 502. If enacted, this
bill will lead to newcomers of
New Mexico to be educated about
what it entails to have an
executive running through their
property and what it means to be
a pariante.
Too many people have moved to
New Mexico, purchased a piece of
property with a secure water
rights and do not know the legal
rights of the Esequio community
ditch. This bill will help to
educate them on asseias, the
seki's rights and easements and
the obligations as a pariante
before purchasing a piece of
property that is affiliated with
the secular community ditch.
This will decrease the legal and
sometimes physical conflicts
that can occur on in a secular
when a newcomer to New Mexico is
unaware of the Osea, the Osea's
rights and easements and the
obligations.
as a personiante. Please vote
yes. Thank you to the sponsor
and thank you for your time,
Madam Chair and members of the
committee.
Uh, madam chair members of the
committee, I'm Harold Trujillo.
I'm president of the New Mexico
Ase Association and I've had a
lot of experience with new
owners coming in, uh, years ago,
uh, we had, uh, people that, uh,
bought some property up in uh
the Mora area, and they came in
from Texas, which has different
laws, so under those laws, you
know, they, they can do
everything they're entitled to
to the core of the earth, right?
So their paradigm is different,
right?
have a split estate in in our in
our state, right? So that's one
of the problems, right? They
don't understand the laws of the
state. Another point is from a
safety point of view, you know,
when you go and clean the
stitches, you know, they, they
come out with a rifle, right,
and they don't want anybody on
their property, so he would help
from a safety standpoint, you
know, to, to have this kind of,
of, of legislation. I've seen
cases where even if you go tell
them and you, and you tell them,
you know,
You're gonna be there, the, the,
the weekend to clean the Aseca,
they still come out and shoot in
the air, right, and intimidate.
Thank you. Thank you.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Arthur Arleta. I'm with
the New Mexico Land Grant
Council, uh, council supports
this bill. We um see this also
with land grant communities
oftentimes where you have a new
owners who purchased former
common lands that have eastments
on them and it creates problems
and issues that could be
resolved. Um, so we think this
is a good matter of public
policy.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Don
Bustos, and I own a small farm
in Santa Cruz, New Mexico. I
support everything these
gentlemen said before me, but I
want to add also the first thing
these folks do is they come in
and they go, we're gonna sue
you. They pony up with attorneys
and they sue the Aseass, it all
gets caught up in court and the
judges, so it's a huge expense
for an impoverished to say, so
we support this bill. Thank you.
Thank you so much. Anyone else
in the room? OK, we're gonna
move to Zoom if you're in
support, please raise your, uh,
when I ask you.
Uh, when I asked you to unmute
yourself, uh, please do in your
time will start. You'll have one
minute and please take your.
Uh, can you hear me?
We want to see Dios. My name is
Patrick Jaramillo, um, and I am
a ariante, uh, and an irrigator
on the secular des Garcias.
And I'm also uh uh a member of
the New Mexico Asea Commission.
Um, Madam Chair, members of the
commission committee, I
respectfully ask you to pass
this bill for all the mention
all the reasons mentioned by the
sponsor and the previous
speakers. It is a good bill and
transparency and information is
more is more of that is needed.
Again, I respectfully ask you to
pass this. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Next up we have Jill.
Hi, my name is Jill Martinez. I
am a farmer in El Prado, New
Mexico on an aaa, a small farm.
And I am also in support of this
bill for all the reasons
mentioned before, and I know
that financially, it would make
a big difference to smaller
zekias.
And more impoverished to say he
is, as the gentleman said
before, with lawsuits and just
because of general not
understanding, and this would
address that. Thank you.
Uh, good morning. My name is uh
Judy Torres. I am the vice chair
of the New Mexico Commission,
and I'm also the uh um executive
director of the Telite
Association.
Uh, we have found this, uh,
being an issue for many years in
Taos, um, we've developed a
pamphlet trying to explain this
to newcomers.
Um, it's a
It's a great bill, something
that we have been looking for
for many years, so we would
appreciate it if this would
pass. Thank you.
Good morning. Can you hear me?
We
Yes.
Madam
So when it's, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, my
name is Luis Pena and I'm
commissioner
on Laos and La Plaza and Serta
Plaza, the most vice president
regional association in the
Caliente area and a member of
the Concilia with the New Mexico
Ase Association, uh, I'm in
support of HB 502, uh, for the
reasons mentioned before and
also because insurance buyers
and sellers in New Mexico's real
estate market have full
transparency, uh, when it comes
to a second easement's
obligations and water rights.
It's a common sense measure that
Motes responsible land
transaction, and most
importantly, it strengthened New
Mexico, uh, water traditions for
generations to come. Thank you.
Thank everybody, Madam chair at
that comment.
Wait, OK, if you oppose this
bill, raise your hand.
Seeing none, and one on the zoom
who opposes this bill. OK.
We'll go back to uh the sponsor.
We're gonna go to.
many questions now,
Representative, um, first up is
Miramal Moya.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you so much. Um, I'm happening.
This is, this is, it is kind of,
it is kind of crazy, um, my
question is, um,
I used to sell real estate in
California, so that was like a a
crazy thing, so the, so all the
right now currently is like
because you were saying that you
had an issue just finding out
something about yours. Is there
a certain entity where people
are gonna be able to go, um, in
order to get this information if
they are, um, if they don't have
it like on paper to to get the
specifics. I mean, because you
have word of mouth, and I know a
lot of with land grants in the
it's all about word of mouth and
this point.
that point in that tree and
everything else, but we need
something concrete so a buyer
can can can do that. Where could
they go, Madam Chair and uh
representative, uh, they can go
to the they have to have to
follow so uhors can go out of
their way right now to do that
because they live in a
community, so I, I, I think.
Um, Madam Chair, I, I agree with
you because, uh, you know, the
people that understand that this
is, this could be a deal
breaker.
If they did or didn't have these
rights.
Um, uh, uh, some may not, you
know, some dishonest ones may
not uh disclose it because they
want you to buy it and and
assume, and then, and then the
person is, is there, so it
definitely does save the buyer.
I do like the fact that I think
um you um your constituent here
mentioned that if they don't
know, they just have to put that
they don't know the specifics,
so that it's something that you
have to, um,
Research, you need, you need to
look into this. There is, there
is something here, and, and then
we need to look at it, but uh
requiring this would be, would
be great because knowing exactly
what's attached or not attached
to your, your new land is, thank
you, Representative Matthews.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, uh.
Representative and, and
everybody who testified, this is
a really interesting question
and.
Um, a couple of thoughts, uh,
when I practiced law, part of
the I did a fair amount of real
estate law.
And
Um, and I was, I was interested
and and impressed that so many
people talked in their
statements about how this would
be educational and so forth.
Now I'm now as a lawyer.
And I'm wondering, I was curious
that there was nobody here who
Um, from the title in title
insurance industry.
Um,
If we make this something that
is required to be disclosed.
Then we're also essentially, at
least arguably, OK.
Requiring that everybody go sell
property.
And I don't off the top of my
head know exactly what would be
involved in that, but I have
heard.
Uh, I mean, water rights even
not in.
The northern part of the state
where aseki is are, I mean it's
just say, um, trying to pin all
this down is very difficult.
And um
I'm concerned that we may be
imposing.
Liabilities on people who didn't
know they had them.
And I'm not suggesting that
anybody should lie and, you
know, if they know they have
water rights or they don't, they
should disclose that, but it's
gonna be real easy.
I think given sort of how all of
this is done.
Um, I'd like to see something
maybe with some more guidelines
and then the other thing is
this.
This applies to any water
rights. So this applies to
Everybody in the state who's
buying and selling property.
I quite frankly.
Hadn't thought about. I live in
Albuquerque.
Uh, I, of course, I turn on the
faucet and the water comes out,
it's great.
Um, and I know that this, the
Albuquerque, uh.
Owns water rights, but, you
know, if I'm selling my house,
this is imposing an obligation
on.
Water rights, um, I'm not sure I
so.
I'd really like to have somebody
who, uh, I'd really like to.
If, if there is some input from
people who deal with auto
insurance and those kinds of
issues. So so that we don't
catch up people who had
I mean, I, my deeds don't say
anything about water right, but
who are we imposing now?
Um, Madam Chair, um,
Representative Matthews. I said
on the title insurance advisory
panel for 9 years for the PRC,
uh, I was an officer for the
state association of Realtors. I
was their lobbyist for a number
of years, um, so when I was a um
a licensed broker in California,
Colorado, and the state of New
Mexico when I taught classes for
the real estate commission, uh,
I took all these things into
account and I talked with the
folks in the title industry, but
again, it's been a long time
ago.
First of all, water rights, uh,
are one whole set of issues and
as you know they're fraught with
difficulty. So there's only a
degree that anyone, even an
attorney can explain water
rights to a client, uh, but you
can't disclaim and say there are
issues here you need to
investigate this here's an
attorney or and so you can do
that and the real estate broker.
Can handle their liability
issues by either disclosing what
they do know. Here's the
mayordomo's name. I believe
you're on this ditch. You can
call them their knowledgeable
and they'll tell you whether you
do are current, all these other
things or uh you can disclaim
and say I don't know again uh
this is what you should do. I'm
telling you what I know and I've
done my due diligence to try to
find out uh about this so that
covers the realtor's liability,
title insurance first of all.
I wasn't aware of this, uh, for
a long time is that a sites are
not a property right. Therefore,
title insurance does not cover
it. They listed on exception B
on the title policy which is
standard exception saying we
don't cover easements, for
instance, let's say that um
associations have a prescriptive
easement it doesn't have a
surveyed boundary saying this is
where the easement is because
these things change over the
centuries.
And so there's a prescriptive
easement and the title insurance
companies will not insure
prescriptive easements, as you
probably know, because you
cannot definitely define what
that easement is nonetheless, it
exists, it's recognized in the
Constitution of the state of New
Mexico as a beneficial right,
uh, prior appropriation and
beneficial use being our water
law.
And so they deal with it that
way they say it's for the good
of the community, but it's not
an insurable issue maybe someday
it will become insurable, but
that's a risk that'll title
insurance takes the title
insurance agent takes for money
if they think there's money in
it, then they'll insure it and
they'll charge an appropriate
amount. Currently they just
listed as an exception, OK, but
the idea here is to how do you
wind your way through these
things and make it possible.
for the buyer to be
knowledgeable now as far as
someone who is in a transaction
and has no water rights, they
can simply disclaim or or say I
just don't know, I think.
As a buyer you need to
investigate there may be uh to
go off on a little tangent I
found out about some oil and gas
rights I have on a piece of
property that came from my
grandfather. I only found out
about it 100 years later, some
of these things we just can't
know, uh, they'll come up over
time, but I think to your answer
for everybody who has a real
estate transaction and the
realtors will put this on their
form.
is they'll put uh if there are
water rights, uh, we're not
aware of them and you need to be
advised there may be.
And you should do whatever you
need to do to satisfy yourself
before you make this purchase
that there are or are not rights
and there are or are not
obligations. We believe there
are a psyche rights or we have
reason to believe, and we think
you should investigate this. We
don't know. I hope that answers
your question. I, I don't see
any other parties with
liability, but I think this way,
uh, it, it puts the burden back
on the seller too to say, well,
tell us what you do know you
should know.
By now if you do, please tell us
it's, it's an important, it's a
material fact and we might not
buy this piece of property we
may not want to be involved with
this and we'll buy something
else, but it, it, it takes the
opposite of that, but it also
eliminates huge amount of
misunderstanding and a lot of
money being spent needlessly, I
think when simple disclosure
would have solved the problem.
Thank you.
Representative Cates.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, uh, Representatives for
bringing us, uh, forward. So in
full disclosure, I am on this
bill for so let's break this
down. We already have in place
an adverse material facts sheet
that has a paragraph in it that
says, please disclose the seris
well septic water rights and you
can check off, I don't have any
knowledge about about them. We
also and I provided.
For the sponsor of a standard
contract that shows when you are
purchasing.
Um
Do we have any of these issues
and it tells you already go to
these uh state engineer's office
or go to the county to get
information. So we have those
things in place. I, I also in
disclosure, I wasn't part of
developing the sub, and so I
will respectfully ask, I
understand the reason why Tidal
conference, but I don't
understand why we can't have
title companies require it
before closing, just like they.
require easement, they have to
show easements before they
close, they have to show HOA and
ask for HOA documents. Why can I
not ask? It was a aka documents
or any of the other documents
upon closing and then I don't
know whether or not we can ask
them to ensure such things like
you said, they can't ensure the
easement, but it is part of
their required closing
documents, so before that
transaction closed.
everything is transparent or as
much as transparent as well,
just so you know this is not the
the the buyers and sellers are
responsible for uh figuring out,
but the sellers are legally
obligated to disclose if they
know, but the buyer doesn't know
and like you said, if you're
from Jersey, you don't know how
precious water is, and so, um,
and so I, I would think that
that that would be a solution
that I would like you to.
Consider um for the next
committee, but I am very
grateful that you bring this
too. I, I, um, abstract of
transparency when it comes to, I
would love to have a paragraph
about like our general water
rights in those contracts as
well to explain people that, you
know, you do have, you know,
surface water, um, so, uh, thank
you very much for bringing
working with us. May I respond,
Madam Chair.
Quickly, please,
uh, when I was the secretary
treasurer of the Realtors
Association of New Mexico. I
worked with forums Committee a
lot and the attorneys that work
for the Realtors association,
not all real estate licensees
from members of the Realtors
association, nor do they use
that contract. There are also
private party sales and we think
it's important for everyone to
disclose whether they're
represented by a realtor, which
is in a particular association
as well and so um this is part
of the reason also.
closing agents are not
technically part of title
insurance. So that's a different
and title insurers there's a
regulation process which might
be the appropriate place for
attempting to change the title
insurance laws rather than in
the statute. Thank you very
much, Madam Chair, uh
Representative Representative
Pettigrew, I'm so sorry. I
didn't see that you had.
I think she wants to.
After that.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Amazing
that I may have an opinion on
something, but
I appreciate your time and I
appreciate the uh.
I think the problem that you're
bringing forward.
My concerns.
Rotate around reviewing the
comments from the OSC.
And chairman and Representative,
I would have loved to have a
couple of
Water right and.
Land law attorneys up here with
you.
To
Not through some of this stuff.
I am truly concerned that that
With the
Briefness of this legislation.
The thes may be putting
themselves into a position for
legal fights with the asseass
themselves.
Aren't able, I don't think your
bill is ready for prime time
yet.
With respect to that.
Um, I personally know that.
This land that I bought and
purchased and it's been in the
family forever, water rights are
difficult. Minerals. I can't
imagine the problems that you
guys have and then the safety
area.
And I don't uh want to pretend
that I want to understand those
either because I don't have
enough.
Aspiring for that.
Um
But it is a problem. Just not
sure.
You guys are dealing with or
The potential issues that can
come from this with respect to
Legal aspect on the asse um and
Because of that, I'm probably
not gonna support it. I'm not
trying to stop the bill from
happening, but I think that
there needs to be some excessive
amount of discussion with with.
Um, mineral rights and water
rights.
way the brevity within this
bill.
I think it opens up a can of
worms.
Thank you, Madam
Pettigrew, um,
representative.
Uh, so for me.
Admittedly, I don't.
I have some questions just
generally about how this happens
today. So I appreciated hear in
place when we're buying
property, all of my water is on
a well, so I never get to use
the river and we use our wells.
Um, and so I, I'm trying to even
think back of like when we're
trying, but it does make me a
little bit anxious that um we're
not hearing a, a bigger sponsor
about how that's how that would
thank you.
Mm
Madam Chair Representative.
Again, the way in contracts we
try to deal with situations
where we can't know all the
possibilities, for instance, the
water law, uh, we have issues
that are still in front of the
Supreme Court dealing with water
law and it's not possible for
any reasonably to expect anyone
licensed in real estate to be
able to explain those, but at
some point we cut that off and
say, look, we've done our best
attempt to tell you everything
we know we're being completely
honest.
with you about this transaction
so that your eyes wide open and
you're making your decision and
we just limit the liability in
our contract language with uh
we, here's what we know and
here's what we believe we have
and if you need additional
advice, contact an attorney. I'm
sorry.
What are, what's happening when?
Property will not pass what's
happening today? Well, right now
it's pretty much up to the
seller. I mean, the buyer.
To find the try to figure out
what it is, but really most of
the responsibility lies
information, but sometimes, like
I said, not everybody's a
realtor, you know, not everybody
is a member of the Realtors
Association, uh, some, and it's
pretty much.
What
What the current knowledge is
about about being either a
second, so, so.
Every place is different, but
was close either what they know
or what they don't know.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I think
I got a little bit confused when
the vice chair weighed in cause
she said there's already a sheet
and it certainly New Mexico.
You're probably
Have you tested your wealth?
When was your well, your well
had last service.
Because, again, if some of that
goes out, you have nothing. You
have on, um, so certainly, Madam
Chair, I appreciate the
intention of this and I think it
um that even just looking at the
committees that were draft bill.
Um, I appreciate it sometimes
and I, I don't honestly know the
distinction between when we have
a draft piece of legislation
that sites existing statues. I,
I just don't even know today
what already.
Are, I, I think it's a, a with
the material facts generally and
I don't have. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
Uh, thank you. I just, I just
have a question as well before
we go to the vote representative
da da da. Where, where will this
law go?
What in what part of the
statutes?
Um, Madam Chairman, Madam
Chairman, members of the
committee, uh, there was a
discussion with Bill drafter
about whether to put it in the
real estate section or to put it
in the Asakia section, I
contended that it belongs in the
psychia section and that anyone
who's.
Coming into this would uh that's
the place they would rationally
go look is in the Ezea section
and established that uh.
This is, this is um something
that needs to be disclosed as
part of owning the it's not just
real estate, it's there's things
beyond that and so I understand
that. I think the challenge that
we're facing is that we don't
know where this law is going to
go and it's going to go to the
judiciary next, and I surely
don't want to be the one to say,
oh, hey, we passed a bill, we
don't know where it's going to
go, you guys fix it. Um, is
there any way you would be open,
representing Para to
roll in this
Thank you, Representative
editor. We will do that, uh, and
yeah, great. Thank you. We're
gonna move on to the next one.
Mm
fun, Representative Pettigrew,
no fun allowed today.
Representative Johnson.
Whenever you're ready to present
House Bill 5669.
Johnson whenever you're a chair
Johnson, whenever you're ready.
Good morning
madam chair.
And good morning, committee
members. Thank you.
Today we have before you house
bill.
569
And this is a bill that is
requesting to make an
appropriation to fund 10 million
to complete the Navajo water,
Navajo Gallup Water Supply
Project.
He can this time and 9 lateral
and 371 regional water supply
project.
This is located in northwest New
Mexico and
Kiley and San Juan counties.
N G WSP is a multi-phase
construction.
It's a regional project, and it
will provide water supply.
that is critical to 12 Navajo
communities.
The 12 Navajo chapters with a
combined population of more than
10,000 people are in dire need
of safe, sustainable drinking
water.
The project has
Uh leveraged support from the
state of New Mexico, our state,
and our nation and the federal
government.
And this is uh amazing work that
has taken place since 2006,
which I will have my expert
witnesses elaborate.
So I'd like to have my expert
witnesses, Andrew Robertson and
Mr. Johnny Johnson introduced
themselves and provide a
statement. Thank you.
morning, Madam Chair, members of
the committee. My name is Andrew
Robertson, and I'm a consulting
engineer for the Navajo Nation
Department of Water.
Good morning
Chair, members of the committee,
uh, my name is Johnny Johnson.
I'm theector president of one of
these communities, then you.
So
31
Chapter called the novel Agency
Council.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Would
you like to continue before you
move to public comments?
Yes, I'd like to address
And uh
We have, we have a couple of men
before we go to appropriations.
It's an amendment to the title
of the bill.
And um
We are taking out regional
waterline and cutter.
An interstate 40 project in the
title.
And it, the title will now read
the Navajo Gallup Water Supply
Project.
He can decide and 9.
371 Regional water supply.
The other correction we'd like
to make is
Um, suggesting that
The New Mexico I add the
appropriated money as opposed,
I'm sorry, ma'am, can you tell
me again who is gonna be
appropriating the money Indian
affairs um general friend to
Indian affairs and not.
The depar um uh Madam Chair, so.
Line 18.
We'll say, we'll we're striking
Department of Environment where.
of Indian Affairs, correct.
Um
Members of the committee, are
you
OK with a, how do you feel about
an on the fly amendment.
That's of this nature.
Representative Pettigrew.
my first question before we
Madnessville.
would be
Is the 10 million.
Yes, I believe through the
I'm sure I was just kind of
curious. I don't remember the.
Project there in come out that
the specific reason to try and
figure out whether or not the,
the changes that are
Reques are an issue and
I don't have
inside.
I think that's a conversation
that we should probably have
within like once we've amended,
once we're OK with amending, uh,
when we're at the committee
questions, if that's OK if you
can pause on your questions.
Members of the committee are be.
How do we feel about that, about
amending on the fly.
It's not something that we
typically do, but I think this
is something that um in the
interest of time.
Give us just a second.
All right, so we're gonna, the
chair. If you can repeat exactly
so that Sasha can take it down.
OK, in the title.
On the top.
Line 11
is going to stay the same.
Line 12.
We are deleting regional water
line.
And then we are deleting.
cutter.
cutter.
And after lateral, we are adding
and.
And then on line 13.
We are deleting slash Interstate
40 project.
And we will be adding regional
water supply.
And then line 18.
And we are
So then the title will now read
an act making an appropriation
for the Navajo Galla water
supply project.
Beacon, this diet, and 9, and
371 Regional water supply
project.
Yes, lateral, OK.
No cutter.
Manager, I'm gonna read it
again, making and actma in
preparation for the Nava Navajo
gallop water supply project,
Beacon this guy number 9.
I lateral.
And regional water supply.
Yeah, and 371 and 371 regional
water supply project.
Yes.
And then line 18.
are deleting Department of
Environment.
adding
Mexico, India.
Yes, yes, yes. OK, I think.
about it and
Uh, if we don't, we'll
And we'll fix it.
OK. Um,
Emotion
So, so the way that was
announced, man.
Representative
All right, that the way that was
announced.
to delete
Of environment.
But why did lead department
environment.
Thank you, Ma.
We got it on the side.
OK, um, any, uh, any
position.
To adopting the amendment.
You have an amended bill.
Ready to go to public comment
now.
OK. If you are in favor of House
Bill 5169 as amended.
complicated way that we just uh
That we just did. Please raise
your hand.
And if you'd like to speak, um,
keep your hand raised.
and will
Um, will come to you.
We
like, you have one minute.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Marco Gonzalez and I'm
the registered lobbyist for
McKinley County. Uh, we
appreciate the sponsor for
bringing this very important
critical piece of legislation uh
for our area, uh, to, to you on
the day, and we ask for you to
support it, um, this is a major
uh project at the Bureau of
Reclamation is undergoing to
construct a reliable drinking
pipeline from the San Juan River
of the eastern sector to the
Nano Nation by Brook portions of
Hickory and Apache and and
Amonational, so it's really
important for us for water
purposes and we appreciate if
you would please pass this
forward. Thank you, Madam Chair
and member of the committee.
Good morning, Madam Chair and
members of the committee, shared
runs the P&M.
Uh, we appreciate the work of
the sponsor, and we believe this
is an important bill.
In 2023 PNM transferred critical
water infrastructure from the
retired San Juan generating
station to the US Bureau of
Reclamation to help deliver
water to meet the current and
future needs of more than 43
Naval Nation chapters through
the Navajo water supply project.
by transferring existing
infrastructure to the project,
these chapters avoided the
construction of a new water
intake system in a less ideal
area of the river, saving
millions of dollars. I think
this, this project isn't um what
I've just mentioned is a part of
this wider novel.
water supply project on a
personal note, I am also a
Navajo Nation member.
I have seen the progress of this
effort through the Carilateral
project as mentioned, uh, which
is connected to the wider navel
gallow water supply project, my
partner's grandma and nearby
relatives now have access to
clean, safe drinking water in
the consular chapter area. This
project is changing lives for
many on the Napo nation, and
this is an important effort.
Thank you.
Anyone else in the room?
She will go to Zoom and see if
anyone is in support of
A house full of 569 as amended.
Hey, if anyone in opposition to
this bill, raise your hand.
Seeing none, uh, we're going to
go to the committee for
questions now, the first step.
Madameer passed for a minute. I
need, I'm still trying to find
this one house too.
Uh, anyone else?
Any questions?
Representative will be
And I'm sure I was gonna do much
for to pass.
Great.
2.
If you have a question.
Yes. Go ahead and ask your
question and then we'll come
back to the mission. Madam
Chair.
And Madam Chair representative.
So I had to be out of the room
to present on the bill.
Thank you, Representative. I
would like to defer to my expert
witness.
Madam Chair representative, um.
So, very briefly, this is part
of the overall Naboa supply
project, which is part of the
Navajo Nation.
Sit in Mexico, uh
settlement for the San Juan
River
It contains many components, um,
two of which are the
bilateral and the 371 regional
water supply project. Those are
two pieces of the overall.
water supply project.
So
Um, and so the
suggested changes to the bill
just uh more clearly identify
those two components of the
overall.
that answer.
And.
If my memory served me well.
You've been working on.
Representative Madam Chair, yes,
this work has been in existence
since then it's been an effort
between the Navajo Nation.
In the, in the works with our
congressional delegation, but
the idea here is to match funds
from the Navajo Nation, the
state, and that, and I'd like to
defer to my expert witness.
Madam Chair Representative just
a brief bit of history on this,
uh, as uh Representative Johnson
mentioned.
chapters started working on this
in 2006 and it literally started
at a chapter level.
Um, having bake sales and
selling fried bread and the
chapters raised about $20,000
each between 8 chapters, they
came up with 100.
$60,000 by 2007.
In 2007, uh, those you may
remember.
called the Year of Water and.
State matched that.
money from the local
with
$15.3 million
2 years after that in 2009, the
Federal government, Congress
passed the San Juan River.
Settlement Act, um, and in 2012.
The federal government.
stepped in and matched to the
state and Navo nation's
contributions with uh
$160 million. So uh a leveraging
ratio of over 10 to 1. That was
in 2012.
In 2018, a similar thing
happened.
side, which is one of the.
We see here.
And you can see it's in the, if
you have a handout on the table,
this Nabo nation is contributed
over $10 million to be convinced
the state is contributed a
little over 12 million.
So that's in 2018, the federal
government stepped in to match
that with uh just shy of $75
million and
Interesting to note that uh
those are in different.
demonstrations between
2012 and 2018, so it did receive
bipartisan support at the
federal level.
Thank you, thank you for that.
Uh
I didn't, I didn't mean to
believe that that heavy and,
and.
Mad, Madam Chair and the expert
witness when it came to state
land.
The state land office help you
in any way Eastminster State
Land and all that.
Ma Chair Representative, uh,
yes, the, the state land office
has, has been good work.
So we have worked with them
land for
and, and
Amateur and expert witness. Do
you know what the cost was for?
And I
Madam Chair, Madam chair, Madam
Chair, and an expert witness.
Thank you for your answers.
Thank you for that, uh,
Representative Matthews.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you Jane and experts, I, I'm
just curious, is the reason for
the changes and I was reading
this last and it says in the FIR
that it's unclear if the service
area has been amended to include
all the right places and there's
questions about whether the
description is right. Is that
what we were fixing with your
amendment?
Madam Chair Representative, um.
Some
The simple answer would be yes.
Um, it's more nuanced than that,
but sim but simply put, yeah,
yes, this is, um, addressing
that um this is directing more
specifically which components of
the project are needing fun
funding at this time. So
I represent an expert. This is a
better definition.
Thank you.
Represent.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair, and
I, you know, I saw the plans. I,
I was really impressed at this
overall. I, I, I was kind of
amazed and I've watched this
legislation over the years. I'm
curious, you changed the
oversight of this, you know, the
environment department is
drinking water and uh standard.
Madam Chair Representative, um.
And I should be, I should uh
disclaimer I'm an engineer, not
a lawyer, so I hope I don't say
this wrong but um these water
lines would be operated by the
Navajo Tribal Utility Authority,
and my understanding is that the
Environment department would not
have jurisdiction over uh water
systems operating within Navajo
lands, um, there is a precedent,
the, the past phases of this,
for example, the cut lateral,
which was completed that uh uh
one of the public comments was
referring to that got complete
and was providing.
Service right now that those
state funds were administered by
the Department of Indian
Affairs, um.
past state funds for this for
other components of this project
were also administered by uh
department by Department of
Indian Affairs with the Nabo
nation acting as a fiscal agent,
and those were very successful.
So it would seem that that would
be a, there's a precedent for
that working out.
Uh, Madam Chair Representative.
I certainly would not want to
presume to speak on behalf of
the agency, um.
However, as um
An engineer for working with for
the Navajo Nation on past.
Components of this project, um,
the way it's worked in the past
is that
IAD Indian Affairs Department
would
Um, would convey the funds to
the Navajo Nation's fiscal agent
and then the Navo nation was
responsible for hiring
hydrologists, uh, environmental.
Scientists, surveyors,
engineers, construction
contractors, etc. And so the
Nabo nation bore those costs of,
of uh project execution.
Last question, I guess, um.
Madam Chair Representative, I'm
assuming.
Madam Chair, I still can't find
it's in the non-reoccurring, but
I can't find it.
Um
And it gives them to 2028 to
suspend it, so.
It may or may not be in there.
OK, we have a do pass motion,
uh, of.
Uh, this bill as amended.
Can I get a second?
OK, great.
Um, what's the will of the
committee?
OK, uh, you have a, uh, a due
pass unanimously on HB 569 as
amended. Um, we're going to make
sure that we've got all the
changes here that, that, um.
That you have set out and we'll
get this bill amended. Thank
you.
for being so um
willing to accept those
amendments on the fly, yes,
thank you.
Of course
Madam Chair member committees as
the president of these
communities, I'd like to express
my thank you and on behalf of
the sponsors here.
We appreciate your support. And
yes, we need water. I personally
don't.
have running waters, a hollow
water.
So you come visit me, you have
to take a bath.
Thank you. I think this
committee would love to uh to
come visit. Thank you so much
and congratulations. OK, next up
is House Bill 427.
Take a second.
Whenever you're ready,
representative Lara Kadena.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I
appreciate the opportunity to
present HB 427. Um, I did have
an amendment, Madam Chair, that
was
provided to the committee.
Sometime yesterday morning,
I believe
that, um.
I think we need to move the
amendment.
I'm sure I'll move the amendment
for a discussion.
OK, can you go ahead and explain
the amendment, I'll explain the
bill and provide context for the
amendments as well. Um, Madam
Chair, House 427.
Uh, what we're attempting to do
here is to add.
An authorized towards the
projects that can seek financial
assistance from the Water Trust
board. So, Madam Chair, on page
2 of this bill, you'll see the
current authorized qualifying
water projects that are for the
storage, conveyance, or delivery
of water to end users,
implementation of federal
endangered Species Act,
wastewater conveyance and
treatment, restoration and
management of watersheds, flood
flood prevention, water
conservation and recycling
treatment or reuse of waters
provided by law or
Monitoring and protection of
water quality. So that is the
essence of this bill, Madam
Chair. Uh, so for there, for the
local governments and water
authorities that exist across
New Mexico, they'd have a 7th
qualifying um purpose to which,
which they could seek financial
assistance for real um what our
amendment does, Madam Chair, is
address the concerns raised by
the New Mexico Finance
Authority, so it was our attempt
with the drafter to make sure
that adding
This, um
Potential purpose to the list
would be in line with the other
processes already used by the
New Mexico Finance Authority in
moving moving projects through
the Water Trust board. So our
amendments, um, as directed and
in conversation with the New
Mexico Finance Authority, our
attempt to clean that up and do
that accurately. Thank you,
Madam Chair. OK, thank you. Um,
any questions on the amendment
before we.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and,
and, uh, on page 4, when you
change that to financial
assistance. What can you kind of
explain that to me what
What that means, why we did
that.
Madam Chair.
Madam Chair, Representative,
certainly, um, so we had used
that language with the drafter,
uh, what.
Came from the New Mexico Finance
Authority is their standard
language is financial
assistance, and of course they
have a makeup of how they get
those dollars out, whether they
be low interest or no interest
loans or grants. So financial
assistance was just gonna add up
with the other ways that they
move. OK, so, so Madam Chair,
and, and representative it's,
it's to cover all the bases on
the different kinds of
Yes,
it's to make sure that we
weren't um doing anything
differently than what the water
trust board typically does in
approving these projects, moving
them forward for legislative
approsal, just making sure that
it was their language, financial
assistance, and they have their
ways of.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you,
just in line with the uh with
the new rules that they think
low income communities uh
before.
You know, everybody kind of had
the same answer instead of
loans, and although the loans
Weren't made for a.
to pay this money back. So, so
this is really intended, I am
more low income their water
projects. Is that correct?
Certainly, Madam Chair
Representative, and that might
speak more to the, the purpose
of the bill is for me and
certainly representing Southern
New Mexico, you all maybe have
heard about CRA and our problems
with arsenic, um, what this
opportunity would mean is that
closer to the ground, uh, we
would know that people would
know it was in their water in
real time. So, separately then
compliance or regulatory matters
in front of them, we would have
better access to real data so
that our local governments could
be respon
to the needs of and trusted
information related, certainly
the amendments are making sure
we do that right within the
parameters of NMFA and their up
to date, up to-date rules, uh,
the overall bill certainly has
that purpose in front of it to
try to make sure we're carrying.
Thank you.
Uh, and thank you, uh, Madam
Chair, and thank you, rep Ars
not just in the South. It's
probably a representative
Matthews on the amendment.
We're on the bill. OK, let's
wait then. OK.
What's the will of the
committee?
OK, uh, you have an amended
bill. So we're gonna go to
public comment now unless you'd
like to discuss.
Madam Chair, that'd be great.
Thank you. Uh, if
Folks in the room are in support
of this bill, uh, and would like
to speak, raise your hands.
Right?
We will come to you. We hold the
mic. You have one minute.
Good morning. My name is
Jonathan Macias. I'm the
assistant county manager in
Donana County. Uh, previously I
oversaw and supported our
utility department, which does
wastewater treatment. I wanted
to speak here in terms of
support because have we had
something like this during some
of the outcomes are going with
Crow, which is supported through
a JPA. It would have been nice
to have seen that trend analysis
in real time and been able to
have that dispatch directly to
enemyD so that they could take
the appropriate action and also
rally the necessary support
statewide. I don't speak on
behalf of the commission. We're
still going to have them review
it and
provide their support, but we
also support rep uh.
Oh
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. I'm
Sayeri Yamada and I'm the
registered lobbyist for EPO
Water. Epco is a regulated
public utility that designs,
builds, owns and operates
essential water and wastewater
services in various communities
around New Mexico. I'm here
today to express our support for
house Bill 247. We believe this
bill is critical because it
provides communities which may
lack the resources to invest in
the advanced water monitoring
system, and to have the ability
to track water quality in real
time. This is essential for
ensuring the safety and the
well-being of residents,
allowing these communities to
take timely action to address
potential water quality issues.
For this reason, we respectfully
urge you to support House Bill
247. Thank you.
Uh, good morning, Madam Chair.
Good morning, members of the
committee. Um, good morning to
the representative who's
carrying the bill. Thank you
for, for doing this and, and uh
Jim Kenny, Environment
secretary, uh, thank you. Um,
Madam Char, this is the type of
bill that will catapult both
protections of public health,
even though the regulatory
scheme may take some time to
catch up to it. There's no
reason we shouldn't be real-time
remote monitoring systems in New
Mexico. The other piece
That this will help with, it'll
spin technology out of our labs,
it'll cause investments in the
in the state. It'll help with
our utility operator training.
It'll do all the things we've
been trying to do, and this is
just the catalyst. So whether
it's POs and Clovis or uh
arsenic throughout the state. I
agree with Representative
Herrera.
Um, or, you know, specific to
rua, these are the exact
benefits that we'll get for our,
our New Mexicans if we move
forward and and push something
like this, the regulatory scheme
will catch up. So thank you,
Madam Chair.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Jennifer
Bradfield, and I'm a registered
lobbyist for Borderplex digital
assets and an attorney for
Apaloma. Um, here I'm speaking
for Borderplex Digital Assets
and public comment.
Knowing about clean water is
essential when you're recruiting
employees to live in a
particular area within New
Mexico. And if people can't
trust their drinking water
resources that they have, it's
gonna be very difficult to grow
our economy. Um, currently
residents need to be able to
trust their water quality,
future residents need to be able
to trust their water quality,
and we want to have a mechanism
in place. Technology has now
expanded and we can take
advantage of having real-time
dashboards that give us
information and data.
about contaminants that might be
in our water or just minerals
that are running high that are
unsafe for human consumption.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Vanessa Laried, and I'm
a registered lobbyist for
Borderplex Digital, as well as a
lobbyist for developments in
Santa Fe County, Sandoval
County, Valencia County, and
Berlingo Counties.
So I wanted to really thank the
sponsor, Representative Lara
Kadena for bringing this
forward. Um, I'm coming from the
perspective of economic
development, and just as I'm
following this other individuals
speaking in support, I will say
I echo all that they're saying,
and particularly the aspect of
bringing jobs to the community.
It's very important that we know
what's in our water. Thank you
very much.
Hi, Madam Chair, members of the
committee. My name is Alicia
Keys. I am the former economic
development cabinet secretary
for the state of New Mexico, and
I am the CEO of Apaluma. Apaluma
is a unified API for government
data. When I was a secretary,
one of the things we started to
realize is we really don't have
the data. We don't have the data
to do sustainable economical
development, the way we want to
do it. And we have the
technology now, and we have the
software. So not only
the community of people that
live in these rural areas, but
also the businesses that want to
go in there and develop and
create jobs, really need to know
that the water is OK to drink.
So just please urging you to
support 247 and thank the
representative for bringing this
bill in front of you. Thank you.
OK, um, if you are in support of
this bill and you're on the
Zoom, you would like to speak,
raise your hand and we'll.
Let you talk.
Madam Chair, we do not have any
members on Zoom in the room
opposes this bill?
Please raise your hand.
Seeing none, anyone on the zoom,
if you're in opposition.
Seeing none of Representative
Larga, then we're going to go to
the committee for questions and
first up, as always.
Representative Pettigrew.
but I will take the opportunity?
Oh, take the representative
piece of cake, you know, I, I
will say this, Madam Chair, when
I first looked at this, there
were, I had.
Several different concerns, but
looking at the complexity and
the reason why
Um, are focusing on these types
of issues. I now understand
that. Sorry about that, but I'm
glad that you did speak,
Representative Representative
Rubio.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you Representative. Um, I just
wanted to, um, I've mentioned it
briefly in during um
representative Verera's
presentation earlier regarding
the situation down in Sunland
Park.
And, um, and the, the last year
that many folks in the community
have been struggling with um
with the contamination of their
water, and I know that in the
analysis, folks have also raised
the issue around PFAST and, and
so I just, I wanna thank you
for, for bringing this bill to
um board, um, I, I, I'm, I'm
curious to hear more because I
know we've heard from public
comment um around like the
economic development piece and
so.
Um, for me, I'm coming from more
of a public health um space and
so I just wanted to get your
thoughts more around, um.
How how this came together and,
and how you see it moving
forward.
Thank you, Madam Chair,
Representative, certainly, and I
think you and I have a lot of
resonance on this. Um, one of
the questions I've asked
repeatedly over this last month
is why we are um mushing up
water policy and economic
development, and for me, those
are distinct. I'm both very
important but distinct
conversations. So my entry point
for um sponsoring this bill,
agreeing to sponsor this bill
was not economic development in
the least. Um, it's knowing that
for so many of us across the
state, water is life and
And if there are technologies
that exist today that could give
our communities and our water
systems, real-time data about
what's there, and it gives our
government's room and, and
urgency to be more responsive in
a pointed focused way. Um, so
for me, Madam Chair
Representative, as we went
through multiple drafts of this
bill before introduction. I made
sure we were checking in with
the municipal league, um, and
others so that we could
Introduce a bill that reflected
where they are and the kind of
financial assistance they may be
seeking. Um, so, Madam Chair
Representative, I think it's
helpful to point out this bill
does not include an
appropriations. That was part of
the conversation, should it,
could it, might it? And I said
no, instead we weren't going to
create a new trust. We weren't
gonna put 30 million of New
Mexico dollars to go buy a new
technology, but instead, we were
going to use a reliable vetted
entity like the Water Trust
Board who could hold all of New
Mexicans water.
needs in front of them and um
instead of putting any special
money there, shout out to the
appropriators, including those
in the room that are putting
infusions of money into the
water trust board, of course,
they also have a direct
allocation from the STBs, but
there's been new um dumps of
cash put in uh through general
fund dollars, so this does not
take priority over any other
use, but it adds a potential
spend for for local governments
and authorities to seek care.
Um, also, uh, just
Being mindful of the other
pressing needs of water users
across New Mexico. We did cap,
uh, what could be spent to this
purpose at 31 $31,500,000 to
make sure that while there's a
need out there and it's real in
conversations with the municipal
League. They had a sense of who
might actually want to invest in
a project like this that doesn't
have these means already, and
that's where we came up with
that cap.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
Representative.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, Representative.
Premora.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you representative for
bringing this bill forward.
As we proceed with, with.
Bills like this.
The only thing that gives me a
little heartburn is
Thinking about how technology
can fail.
And, and
When we're talking sensors and
and
Being put out, you know,
In the field
My concerns
And, and it really
It's gonna be more of a
statement is is.
I don't want
Boots on the ground to be
eliminated.
I don't want
NMED
To say we have sensors in the
river and we don't need to check
that anymore.
So
Because we know sensors can
fail.
And
But we're hopefully we're just
adding another.
Uh, layer of protection.
And, and we don't let go of the
budgets that, that we need to
keep.
On hand
As we, as we go into the in
Into the future with this and,
and take boots off the ground
and not, not do the manual
testing to make sure, make sure
things are working right.
And that concludes everything I
have, Madam Chair.
The will of the committee.
