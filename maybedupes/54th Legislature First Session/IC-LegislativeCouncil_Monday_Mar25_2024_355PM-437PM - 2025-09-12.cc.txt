Hello.
Yeah.
The council has decided to, uh
Appoint a committee of six
Our respective chiefs of staffs
or more more work for you all.
Ah!
My chief of staff, the respect
of leadership offices on the
House side, the protests to find
leadership offices on that side.
To be the one stop shop where
executive session applications
resumes. Etcetera will be
received. That group is tasked
with the council has decided
voice, um, appoint a committee
of jeez.
Pro TEM going for the kill em.
That that group of of staffers
will be responsible for
evaluating for being the first
point of evaluation for
applications as they come in,
Uh, the job posting is I'm
sorry. The job description is,
um, is a protest said earlier,
uh, contained within the statute
so be used to post the position.
Um, and we expect that to begin
that for that process to begin
here shortly. Um, you know, as
soon as soon as this, uh,
council meeting is really
Um Mr Bush saga, I think
I guess sadness is not the right
word because we're happy for
you. But certainly I think folks
feel very strongly about your
leadership and the many years of
service. You provided all of us
and we are sad to see you go but
also very excited for the next
stuff face and also
understanding that this is not
the last meeting. We'll have it
together. We still have a few
more so there'll be plenty of
time for goodbyes and for you to
update us as to life.
So with that, um, I believe we
have staff reports that rule
Will brief us on as the last
part of this meeting.
Thank you, Mr Chairman. Um
As most of you know, former
Rosie and Jim through Hell
passed away recently.
His services are as follows.
Thursday, April the fourth
There's a rosary at 10 A.m. at
ST Francis Cathedral Basilica.
And then there's the mass of the
Christian burial immediately
after that, a 1030 also at ST
Francis Cathedral Basilica.
There will be a burial with
prayers of commendation and
military Horus following the
service at Rosario's Cemetery,
which is 499 North Guadalupe,
the
Family. Former representative,
Um through hell asked that in
lieu of flowers.
Um, that friends and family
considered donations to Scott's
house.
Community Hospice and Respite
House.
His obituary can be found at www
dot Trujillo Funerals, all one
word dot com
Under Jim Rudolfo through here.
Uh, and that
One announcement and then um
Only be just as as an f y I
because, um
Oh, Madam President you
mentioned, um
That Senator Nyberg was going to
be appointed to the Uniform Law
Commission, replacing center
Baca.
Um, the Uniform Law Commission
is hosting.
The its annual conference in
2025 here in Santa Fe.
They have asked for the possible
use of the capital or either a
dinner or reception, which, um,
policy allows me to approve
which I will. I'm already
working with the U. L C.
Group on that.
The last side of my head was
That, uh
The next meeting of the council.
Is there any preference as to
May 6th or May 13th
Both of those are Mondays.
That's roughly 6 to 7.
Well may 6 or six weeks from
now, May 13th is seven weeks
from now.
And then another council meeting
would occur on Monday. June
24th.
That's where you would finalize
some of the things discussed
here today but also
Approved the work plans and
budgets for the interim
committees.
So I don't know if May 6th or
May 13th is
Well, why don't we? Um why don't
we touch base with the respect
of staff? Because I do know? I
mean, they they do have quite a
bit on their plate. Um, And so
I'm wondering if, uh
I'd like to get their feedback
before we decide on a date.
But we'll keep those two open
for now. Um and and they said
here, maybe by the Mr Chairman.
Those are all of the, um
Staff reports I e other
actually, I do have I almost
forgot. It's not on the agenda.
It was just brought to my
attention.
Ah, so roll. We are meeting
again in June to approve the
interim work plans correct.
We usually do the last Mr
Chairman. We usually do the last
Monday in June, and that would
be June 24th legislative, Health
and Human Services Interim
Committee has requested a few
extra days.
Um, but obviously, if we wait
until that point in time, I
think that is there a way for
this council to approve.
Uh, additional days.
Right now and allow those folks
to start meeting.
Next month.
Um, Mr Chairman.
Ah, yes, you do have that
ability to do that. You just
wouldn't have approved their
work plan yet. We haven't put
that together.
I know that LSC has hired some
additional staff to complement
the Council service staff on
Health and human services.
And my understanding is that
Shauna?
Case, PR assistant director for
drafting also oversees interim
committees has met with LSE
staff.
And Council service staff on
That particular committee so
Um, I think it would. I would
only recommend that it be, um
Minimal to some degree before
you approve the work plan.
To the extent that it allows
them to get started, But that
would be up to
To this council to approve if
you what are the thoughts of the
committee? I'm just curious
Thompson.
Thank you, Mr Chair. So as vice
chair of the LHs, um
Probably most of you know that
the state of New Mexico spends
more money when we add in the
federal match on
Healthcare than on anything
else. The our entire budget is I
don't know what it is this year
in the health care budget is
around is over 12 billion
So we have had, you know three
Three day meetings, you know,
five times, and we're supposed
to cover everything from child
welfare to fentanyl to mergers
and buyouts of hospitals to drug
crisis, 2 to 2 and we we simply
cannot even touch on most of the
issues. And so, um, what we
really need is a standalone
committee along the lines of lfc
and L. E s C and we've been
working towards that for some
time, but
Um, it's kind. It's kind of
embarrassing that we spend that
much money without
Dedicated staff and without any
more meetings than the you know
the 15 days or whatever we get,
so I'm just I'm here to, uh, to
beg that we We really need to
get a handle on healthcare. Um,
and this is a tiny step in the
right direction.
To add those days to add those
man protein.
You know, so when have you
usually started? Usually
June or
So you're trying to meet
They would be. I spoke with the
speaker about
Six additional days and and if
we, you know if if that has to
wait until we have work plans,
and I mean I I don't know the
technicalities, but we would
love to get started in, maybe
have an organizational meeting
the end of April and then start
our real meetings extra five
days for for May and June and
then get get it.
I mean, I don't care about the
logistics. I just one of the
issues end any committees. I
mean, I tried to lower the
numbers and no, it wasn't
matched by the house. We've
We've got put that together and
it's almost impossible to put
together as a calendar with 23
committees and more and more
days, so it's just it means that
People won't be able to go to L
HHS or other committees. It's
just we're kind of at the
breaking point. Mr Fair points
hold on a second. Those are
those are fair points. And I
think that we
We're gonna have to do the heavy
lift next. Um for for many, many
reasons.
Except Thompson. We if we didn't
meetings in April and May and
June before most of the other
committees, we won't run into
any more.
As many more conflicts when all
the committees are up and
running, so that's one reason to
do it on the front end instead
of trying to mash it in and
October and November.
Okay, So how? How role? Um, go
ahead.
Mr Chairman I having staff,
health and human services for
seven years. I completely
understand. I do. Um, uh, We
probably are okay this year, but
the interim funding doesn't
start until July. 1. So we that
is something to look at.
Probably okay with leftover from
from last year or for the
current fiscal year.
Um, I
Not sure how to say this, but as
diplomatically as I can. If you
allow one committee, we will get
requests from other chairs to
start earlier as well.
And that just that can create
And then then you're gonna have
requests coming in in May for
meetings, um
Above and beyond the
organizational meeting, so it
just it is up to the council. It
is up to all of you to decide
whether or not you want to allow
an earlier start, um, just a lot
of other stuff going on as well.
It seems odd to me that we
approve work plans in late June.
And then that leaves these
committees.
Four months. Really, to to do
the work? Um, which just doesn't
seem right. I mean, I think for
next year we certainly should
look at maybe maybe approving
work plans today.
And these folks always folks can
start meeting in April, you
know, understanding that they're
different. They now, uh I think
we could probably have a better
process and and that these
agendas are not as packed.
Your soul packed with
information that
It's hard to follow.
Ah, Representative Armstrong.
Thank you. Mr Speaker. I agree.
I was on health for a long time.
And, uh, you know, it's hard to
consume all the data, but it's
also hard to do that on Lfc.
It's hard to do that on water. I
mean, it's hard to do it on a
lot of committees. But I would
suggest is and I know it will
overlap. But try, you know,
doing a
Doing like lfc does. And, uh
Um or yeah, Lfc. Do. Do you know
any evening start on Monday and
go through Friday just do
longer, longer week, but I know
that
Constricts.
Other members from going to
other committees. But you know
what Sometimes we have to
choose and if health is
important than choose health
And get off the other committee.
Sorry.
Representative Republic or, you
know,
Um, thank you, Mr Speaker Chair
and that was the choice that
many people were forced to have
to make this last set. I think
pro TEM Madam pro Temp said.
If you're voting member, that's
That's obviously where you go.
You go to meet your obligations
as a voting member. And if any,
everything else kind of
Uh, works out with your
schedules and go to your other
committees. But that was a hard
choice. It had to be made. Um so
I have a question.
Uh,
If if we leave it optional.
For the chairs.
To make that call to begin their
organizational meetings. April
if we leave that optional
How it's. This is a budget
question. Um, since Raul brought
it up
Is there.
Are there funds?
In this fiscal year.
That would
Kick in.
To help with the logistics.
And the reimbursements.
Should the chairs opt to begin?
And then in my mind, it would
seem better financially fiscally
to work something that out that
way than to say.
Extend the days or whatever
their options we were and give
the charity option. That's you
know, a suggestion that I have
is to provide the gives the
chairs the option if there are
committees and iPod, for
example.
Ours is so structured.
Um, and just here in Santa Fe.
It doesn't pose a problem
necessarily because there we
meet here all the time. However,
the chair might want to have the
option of having the
organization meeting before
But the big question is, will we
be able to, um
Logistically.
Uh, provide what's necessary and
and
Financially provide what's
necessary during this fiscal
year. Should they choose? That's
the question. I ask.
Roll, Mr Chairman and
representative.
Budget wise? Yes, there is
enough in interim expense from
the current
Budgeted interim expense from
last week Feed Bill.
To do that this year.
Um, in terms of logistically,
that's a good question, because
a lot of staff tries to schedule
time off vacations and the like.
In, UH, March April.
Uh, because may and June are
taken up with organizational
meetings. So we have to look at
that.
And, um, to bring up an issue
that was brought up earlier. We
we still often have problems
with with quorum, so
Logistically that can create a
problem as well. If we don't
have the requisite number of
Members, um
Getting ready, You know, being
able to attend this early
because some members aren't used
to that.
Um, I wonder if, um
And I'll go to reserve Romero
next.
So organizational meetings. Um
these are ones I've been
involved in, and I've never
served. You all do it, but
Usually it's a very brief
meeting. Um, you look at
Tentative dates for your men.
Uh,
I wonder if for the purposes of
this committee this one time in
organizational meeting could be
held via zoom understanding that
there is no per diem at that
point.
But that can get a committee off
the ground. You can debate and
discuss your dates. Um, in that
fashion, uh
And it seems to me that
That committee could do that.
Without our approval, Correct.
Could Mr Chairman just so I
understand could meet virtually
without your approval, they
could have an organizational
meeting.
Without our approval. Mr. Mr
Chairman, or that's correct
organizational means, um
Are not approved by the council
or just set in May and June.
We do have a prevent. Zoom now.
That's right. Unless you have
covid in there with all the
topics that HHS has to cover.
our organizational meeting is
actually picking out our three
top, You know, like behavioral
health.
And, um, maternal child health
and, um, you know, C y F t or
whatever. So we we We get into
the meat on day one essentially
got it. Thanks for clearing the
clarification representative
medal.
I don't know if we could do this
Leader is a
Okay, Well, sorry. I'm sorry
that you were finished. I had a
question. Um So, um, could we,
um, actually,
If we were to approve a budget
to get committees on zoom
I think that would be
No, That would be probably a No.
Because I mean, starting on the
and the agenda to take it to
that. Do you agree with that? We
correct We don't have any budget
set out at this because we don't
We don't have any dates or
locations or final capabilities.
Um
That it's prohibited is also
just very
That's it. Thank you, Mr. Thank
you.
Leader is ill.
Mr Chairman. Thank you very
much.
Whenever we're talking about
planning in June.
For all these committee meetings
and everything else that throws
us as lead quandary too, Because
we can't get anything. This is
just a recommendation in in May
We have graduations coming up.
We have state champion kids that
are involved in everything that
there is out there so that I
think that's out of the question
on doing that.
My thought is
At the start of
Each legislative session, each
new legislative session that it
set up.
These committees are set up the
chairs of them with then.
Put together a package on when
they want their committee
committees to be able to meet
and that way if they needed the
three day meetings or a longer,
like the representatives of say,
was saying if they needed to
meet in April and May, they
could go ahead and set a budget
for that. Instead of asking if
we planned at least six months
in advance to the start of our
Five months in advance. It was
certainly help to plan in June
to expect our members because we
do have lives outside of this
building.
Um
It would be a whole lot easier
on us where we could set our
schedules, too. So our bosses if
we work for somebody else would
be aware of what our obligation
me. It makes sense.
That's all.
Good recommendation.
Anybody else?
That emotion.
Represented Garrett. Thank you,
Mr Speaker Chair. Is that right?
Mr Speaker? Chair chair, Mr
Speaker.
Being called worst today. Oh,
Um, Last year, I was the chair
of New Mexico Finance. Uh,
authority oversight. Ours was
art.
Organizational meeting was very
deep and profound. It was May
31st. Our first meeting was two
days in June.
And I just bring it up because
Marquita Russell, I'm not. I
think Senator Padilla's the
chair this time, but she already
told me because of all of the
legislation that was passed,
there's massive amount of
rulemaking that has to be
reviewed and she requested that
we start early because otherwise
we end up at the last minute
doing stuff that needs to be
done earlier.
So I just want to bring that up.
And the other thing is if
If there can be more discussion
on the overlapping like I know,
Dr Ornaments submitted her
proposed schedule for Alias C
before anybody else.
Um
It was not considered first
other committees.
Got overlapping, So just I know
it's really hard with all these
committees.
But just if we can have some
sensitivity about overlapping
and
And discussion about
Um
What if I'm just gonna throw
this out there, So we're going
to meet again in May, either six
of the 13th.
Could we adopt?
Interim work plans at that
meeting.
That would allow these folks to
start meeting
In May.
Mr Chairman, if we if we could
get in touch with the members
who are going to be on that
committee, the chair and vice
chair of of those committees to
work out of work plan with our
staff? Yes, we could bring them
back.
Uh, it's a little
Well, we back up.
Because usually what happens is
that you appoint committees or
reappoint
And then we have organizational
meetings, at which point they
decide on the work plans, and
those work plans aren't
approved. Not sure how we would
have the committee.
Having enough to
To have organization their
proposed work plans of May Mr
Chair on that on that point, can
I offer a clarification? Um
So generally, it's been
experience on several, um, are
presented by the staff.
With a draft.
Work plan that was used
Previously and helps with the
process. So then
That's generally that that
proposed work plan is what we do
in our first meeting.
Where we go through all of that
Proposed work plan and add
delete change and then approve a
schedule. That's generally been
the practice so we don't go cold
into our first meeting and
developed a work plan. It's
generally the staff that
presents it to us from previous,
um previous year with with all
the topics and
And the explanation, so it's
I think it's viable.
To be able to, especially if if
we have our meeting may 6th the
first of the month.
Uh, I'm sorry. May 13th
It would. It would be giving us
enough time. Those committee
chairs and Vice here's to
receive the steps.
Recommendation. Um, for the of
their of the work plan that they
give us anyway.
So from that angle, I think
That's a possibility.
And then I, um
I lost the other point that I
was going to make relative to
that. But I just wanted to
remind us that we come. We don't
just come in and develop a work
plan cold in our first meeting.
We have something to work on so
it it could be violent. It could
be a possible
Um, option too.
Approved. You know me?
Have a work plan.
Have a discussion.
The chairs and vice chairs and
then because it's just a draft
until we have our first
orientation meeting. It just is
a draft and then we have the it
presented to the council.
And then we can approve it as
part of the general practice. I
mean our practice and then we
were ready to role. Um, however,
way. The the chairs and vice
chairs want to set up the
That time so on that's
But thank you. So, uh,
What? What? If, um, just a side
conversation with a pro TEM?
Uh huh.
We will have to restructure all
of this. I think it's fair to
say that we need to restructure.
given all the things we've
heard.
Uh,
As a
Sort of as a test case.
Um
And given the advocacy of the
chair.
Vice chair. Apologies.
Um
What if this council allows for
them to have an organization?
For them to develop a work plan.
That is brought to our main, at
which point we
Approve that work plan.
And they can start meeting
Well, they would start meeting
in April for organizational
purposes and then
Have their second meeting.
In May.
So that would allow you all.
The ability. It seems like a
good compromise. We're not just
giving you an additional six
days open ended. I think we
would allow you to meet. We
approve that work plan in May
you start meeting in mental late
May
The other committees would stay
the same. They would come to us
they we would've shortly
thereafter.
Would. Is that something that
this council would wanna
Consider as a way to move
forward.
And if so, is there a motion?
The setting of the committee of
the Committee dates that we have
the whole pictures, so if we're
gonna sit Ah,
I just don't know how how it
will work with 02 way in here.
if there's anything to say about
it.
Mr Chairman, Um
And madam president.
It.
I'm not sure I understood
correctly. So my I think you
were saying that you were going
to consider or having the
council Consider allowing LHs to
start early, and all of the
others would still have their
their organizational meetings in
May and June and get
Uh,
Their approval at the end of
June like we normally do, but
LHs because it wanted additional
meeting could start as early as
April.
Have an organism have a regular
meeting in June, man and go from
there with everybody else at the
end of June? Is that correct?
That would be the compromise
that we allow Beijing in April.
Set up there or early may set up
their dates. Their work plan.
Bring it to US at arm, a council
meeting for approval.
And then they're off and
running. Another committees
would stick by the
Historical timeline we've used
Um, I won't and the issue that I
raised Excuse if we do that,
What does it do to the process
of setting up all of the
committees in the calendar
Because we don't do that until
May or June, And then we When
people are meeting we finally
have chips, so
You know, right now we have L. E
S. C and lfc that set their
meetings early and around those
two meetings. Everybody gets
clustered. So now we're gonna
You know, right now we have L. E
S. C and lfc that set their
meetings early and around those
two meetings, Everybody gets
clustered. So now we're going to
have a L. F. C and L H H s
Grab those states, So we're
talking two weeks out of the
year to accept the month I'll
let John let's talk about it. So
yes, you would have three
committees.
Lfc El es CNL HHS meeting early
April, May and June. Conceivably
You also don't forget, have the
we try to schedule or not
schedule anything right before
and shortly after.
The primary, so those states so
it will become a little bit more
challenging.
If LHs Yeah, she's gonna have to
start.
Tomorrow. Members of the
council. I don't really have
anything state that the calendar
in
Mr Chairman and Madam president.
The beginning of the meeting.
Well, when we're talking about
the appointments to the interim
committees
Remember you mentioned represent
Cerrato.
And a couple of changes were was
that the only one
Because we still don't have
appointments for representative
Embry, though correct, and we
need to. I need to talk to him.
I haven't talked to him yet.
Because we wouldn't need that.
For Shauna to be able to be a
voting member on any of those
That rounds out the picture so
we can work on that and the
course there's San Juan County
or
We'll pull those in it will have
to start earlier will take some
tweaking as we go through it.
I think what we can set out,
though, are the meetings for
April, May and June LHs and all
of the others for organizations
we start working, or Shauna
starts working on a calendar for
the rest of the year during that
time.
And tweaks that every time a
committee meets state, etcetera,
then we bring that back to the
council.
At the end of all right. So, uh,
represent lobster. Thank you, Mr
Speaker. I'm sorry, but I just
think you're opening a can of
worms that you're going to make
some other committee chairs mad,
and, uh, they're gonna come
after us.
Uh uh, I believe that there
That we would approve their six
days that they're wanting.
Um, and that we could do that,
Like I said, and they can. They
can pick and choose what they're
going to have to go to. I have
to do it all the time. So I'm
just worried that we're we're
opening a can of worms and
Giving extra work.
Um, where I as much as I
appreciate what
H L A G just does. I don't. I
don't know that we should do
this. I think we need to redo
the whole thing as Madame pro,
Tim said, And, uh, let's let's
get it right the first time and
not make little tweaks along the
way.
Uh huh.
Just my opinion. Thank you, Mr
Speaker. Understood And just for
clarification. Um, your are you
advocating to just approve six
extra days or not?
I would advocate for just
approving six extra days, and
then they figure out how to
figure out and let it be on the
same schedule as everyone else.
Okay, That's that's a fair
point.
Leader chasing Thank you, Mr
Chair. And just on that point, I
think they this is without
precedent.
But
It's without precedent for it to
new staff to have been hired by
the LFC. Just staff three new
stuff to US staff LHs in
recognition of their, um really
have you workload, so I kind of
think it's a special situation
and it can be justified to any
other committee chair, and I
I know. Probably representative
Chandler's sitting there, as I
would have been like, Oh, my
God, we have so much to do in C
C. J. But still I think the fact
that we got the extra staff and
the recognition of the big
budget that I think that gives
us a reasonable explanation for
making special
Alright, much started opening a
can of worms here.
It's a big can. Um Okay, so
Uh um.
Back to receive Armstrong's
point.
We could just approved extra
days and then you all would have
to work around these calendars
to schedule your meetings.
Ah, but if we approve an extra
six days, you would then be
meeting more.
Then.
The LFC.
Uh um which, if you're on lfc
Your workload is already pretty.
Pretty heavy. Um
What if we as a compromise?
Approved for extra days. That
should give you more leverage
and a little bit more space to
do your work, but it also
doesn't
Get you out of whack with, um Do
you know Elliot? See what that
would. Where is L? E s C right?
Get you out of whack with, um Do
you know Elliot? See what that
would. Where is Elia? See, Mr
Speaker, Mr Thompson. So, um,
one of the important things I
think I mean, the four extra
days we would love six will take
four. But one of the main things
is for us to be able to get
started early. We do have those
three new positions. We want to
get up and running with them.
So if we have to wait until the
typical June or June or July to
really get started, then that
makes it even tougher to fit
those extra daisy. And so if
you're when you give us extra
days as I'm sure you all will,
um, that we be allowed to use
them early so that we don't
really
Create extra conflict within the
schedules of the typical
Did that make sense, okay?
Yeah, it makes uh pretend
Stewart. Mr. Speaker. I move
that we allow LHs to start.
And that we leave the rest of it
to the normal process. But if
they meet in May
Can they not Then meet again
roll until we approved troubled
here.
Mr Chairman, Madam President, Um
Normally it would be that the
committee cannot meet until
their work plan has been
adopted, Reviewed and adopted.
Um
That's been the normal case.
