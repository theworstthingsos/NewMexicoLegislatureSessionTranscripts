Um Before we get started, I just
want to mention to folks
that the restrooms are
on my right hand side
beyond the gate,
um on my
right hand side over here. So
if you need to use the restroom, they're
just beyond those golden gates
over there, or at least they're golden
from this angle. All
right. So Tim,
if you want to start us off,
>> great. Thank you, Mr.
Chair. Good
afternoon, Mr. Chair and Members of
the Legislative Education Study
Committee. Thank you for the
opportunity to speak with you today
about the rapidly evolving
landscape of artificial
intelligence in
education. As we
stand on the cusp of a technological
revolution, it is
imperative to understand
both the practical
applications and the policy
implications of A I
within our educational
system. A I has
the potential to transform
how we teach and learn,
offering innovative solutions to
longstanding challenges
from personalized learning
experiences that cater to
individual student needs,
to advanced analytics that provide
educators with deeper insight
into student performance
A I driven tools are already
making a significant impact.
These technologies can help bridge
gaps in educational equity,
support teachers in creating more
effective learning environments
and prepare our students for the future
workforce.
However, the
integration of A I and education
also presents several policy
challenges that we must address
to ensure its ethical and
equitable implementation
issues such as data privacy,
algorithmic bias, the
digital and the digital divide
require careful consideration
and robust policy
frameworks. As
policymakers. Your
responsibility is to
navigate these complexities and
create guidelines that maximize
the benefits of A I while
safeguarding the interests of all
stakeholders.
That was pretty good, wasn't
it?
That was Chad GP
T
which probably I shouldn't mention
because now I've just told you all that
chat GP T is better at my job than
I am.
Uh Thank thank you all for,
for the opportunity to talk today
about artificial
intelligence in education.
Um There are a few
things that chat GP T got.
Absolutely right in that
little blurb A I
is already fundamentally changing
how we do education
and nationally
curriculum companies have taken
notice and nonprofits have
taken notice and everyone has
taken notice of the power
of A I to enhance
learning
experiences.
Uh A I is a tool
A I is a tool that both students
can use to enhance their
performance or enhance
their performance on
the assessments that teachers give them every
single day. Um
Teachers can use it also
to better adapt
their strategies to
meet the needs of individual
students. And
so nationally
teachers have been encouraged to
integrate A I tools into their
learning experiences
and uh teacher and
students are being told that they need
to develop a deep understanding of
language so that they can
start to interface with these
tools and use them
and to do this
effectively, uh
everybody in the State will need
guidance on what to do and how
to do it, right? Uh
And so you all as policymakers
now are in a very difficult
situation of figuring
out what do I do
and what do we do as
the State to build
policy around A I and
education A I and schools.
So to help
help you begin to think about
your role in setting A I
policy on today's panel
that we've put together for
you today, we'll discuss a few topics
related to the use of A
I in education.
Uh Before you jump into
policy making policy
around A I, we wanted to
start with sort of a baseline
understanding or formative
conversation about what is A
I, uh how is it being
used and what
can it do? And so
once we have that foundational
knowledge, we can step forward
together and build
a framework that works for the entire
State. So I'm joined
today by Doctor Alexander
Jacobson, uh who
is an A I developer and strategy
consultant. He's going to talk to you a little
bit about what is A I
and what can it do?
Tony Monaldo is the
Executive director of the Institute
of Del Puente. Is the research
and evaluation arm of
future focused education.
And he's going to get share
with you a little bit about a
specific A I that they've
developed to help teachers navigate
Capstone projects.
He's going to talk to you about what it does,
why it's useful.
And then some of the policy
conversations that have come up around
the development of the A I
as, as they have been
working with it.
And then I'm joined by Scott
Elder, the retiring AP
S superintendent and Tom Ryan
co-founder of the K 12
Strategic Technology Advisory
Group. They're going to talk to
you a little bit about how
A I tools are making their way
into schools and what
the State can do to provide guidance
around what's
already happening in schools.
So without further ado,
Dr
Jacobson,
>> thank you, Tim. Thank you, Mr.
Chair. Thank you, Members of the Committee.
I'm very excited to be here
today to talk about what is A
I and the kind of tools
that we're already developing
to help with
education in Mexican
public schools. So for
just a very quick context
about myself, I'm an A I
consultant in Albuquerque.
I have been working with nonprofits
and other public interest organizations
to identify ways in
which I tools
might help with their missions, help
with the work they're already doing.
And then I also make the
tools so I have this kind
of juxtaposition where I help
people understand
what is A I, but I'm
also kind of within the
technical side of it at
the same time. And
due to that kind of
duality, I have a lot of
conversations about what is A
I, what is it,
how does it differ from other forms of
technology we've been dealing with for
the last 1020 30
years. So these kinds of
conversations is something that I've
done fairly frequently over the last
couple of months. So
with that out of the way,
what is A I?
Because, um A I
kind of has the connotation
of magic and a lot of conversations
we talk about without actually defining
what precisely it is.
And A I is nothing
more than a program.
It's 20 gigabytes
give or take and it runs on a very
powerful computer.
This is very different
from the kinds of technology
that we talked about even earlier
today. Um Senator
Brand, talking about Facebook, for instance,
if you were to ask me what is Facebook,
I would say Facebook is a website
that lives on thousands,
if not tens of thousands of computers
around the planet runs on
data servers here in New Mexico,
around the United
States around the world. And
if you were to say where
is Facebook, that's actually kind
of a nonsensical question in the same
way of asking where is the internet?
And A I is very different.
And A I lives in one
place, it lives on a powerful
computer. It takes an
input, it produces
output while it's
kind of nonsensical to say,
should we have a New Mexican internet?
It is a valid question to ask
whether we should have a New Mexican A I
because we can have a localized
program in a way that we could
not for the kinds of technologies
that have been formative again for
the last couple of decades.
OK. We talked about this program.
What exactly is
this program? So an
A I is a neural
network
like neurons, it looks
a lot like our brain. So
the way the human brain functions
is we have a bunch of cells that are
linked to one another with
connections. And when I
say a word like
brainstorm, everyone
in the room has a thought and
the way that thought is generated, it
triggers a neuron, the
connections those neurons have
to one another has that
thought start somewhere and go to
another neuron. The specific
connections you have has to go to
another neuron so on
and so forth. Until
eventually we have a fully formed
thought. Um
The actual thought that
you have specifically is
predicated by the
specific connections in your
brain. The experience
you had in your
educational and
home experiences,
um The specific
structure of your brain leads to
a specific structure of thinking.
And A I looks a lot like
that. It has a lot
of math, but
structurally, it
looks a lot like your brain.
If you give an A I A prompt,
it starts at a neuron
so to speak. And then it does
some math and that math
tells it which neuron to
go to next. And it does
that again and again and again
and again and eventually it
gets you an answer.
This kind of begs the question,
where do these connections
come from? How
does that differ from the human brain?
Um The way
you make an A I
is, you give it a lot of
information and you
ask it to form patterns,
kind of in the same way we
educate students by giving
them all sorts of material and
ask them to with
guidance. Look at it,
understand it, find patterns,
find systems, assimilate
that A I is also
are just given reams and reams of
data and are asked to
basically look at them and
through some very fancy mathematical
processes make
connections.
Um
If you give an A I enough
information, say
the whole internet, which is kind
of where we're at by this point,
they make a lot of connections
and that's how you
get these incredibly
intelligent seeming
programs. We've
given things like chat G
bt clad
various other A is
as much information as
humanity can collect together. We've
asked it to basically form a brain on
top of it.
However, these A is are
static.
So I used
the word rainstorm somewhat intentionally
because I got caught in the rain when I
came here today and I walked into this
room absolutely drenched
the thought association I
have with the word rainstorm is
different than from a couple of hours
ago because I've had this new
experience of ruining
my leather shoes. And
now I think about brainstorm
that thought comes to
mind. A I are
static. We teach
them once and then
they're just the same
until the next A I comes
out. So this is why
if you say asked chat
G BT, what happened in
New York yesterday? It can't
give you an answer. It doesn't have
that information in its brain,
so to speak.
Which means that A I
have a really big
detriment versus humans. They
don't have memory.
What A I programmers have been trying
to do for the last year
or so is find ways to
take these tools that
don't have memory and make them
useful. And
there's a couple of ways you can
make these programs
more responsive.
The first thing you can do
is
you can basically talk
to them in particularly
efficacious ways
A is are very, very
flexible. Um This is
something that has
not hit the public conversation
to the degree that it probably will
at a certain point. But A is are
very, very flexible.
They can be good at a whole
variety of tasks, but
they're not necessarily good at that
task. If you just approach
them with any given
request,
there are certain best
practices in talking to A
is we call this prompt
engineering that
you can utilize to
get them to be as
efficacious as possible.
So if for instance,
they excel at being told
that you are a tool that does blank.
If I ask an A
I to summarize a
document, it might be OK
if I come at it with ur a
tool that summarizes documents,
please summarize blah.
It does a much better
job. The second
thing we can do is we can do
something called retrieval Augmented
generation. So this
is what
of what we're going to be talking
about between myself and Tony
today. Retrieval Augmented
generation is
when we get
around the limitations
and A I's knowledge
by finding relevant
information to give it
before we have it
actually given an answer
to a student, a teacher,
etcetera. So
going back to my example
of what happened in New York
yesterday,
chat, G BT can answer that
question. However, if it
were hooked up to a
database that was updated every
day with all the newspaper articles
in the country, one
thing that the tool could do
is it could go to that database,
it could poll,
it could basically search for
New York News,
June 26 2024
get the answer and
then use that information
to contextualize
what it provides to the end
user. This
lets us circumvent the kind
of static A I and provide
not just updated but
also bespoke output.
This is where you really get
A is to
be particularly good
at new tasks that they
wouldn't necessarily be good at
beforehand. And
then the final way you
can make an A I
specialize, we can get around
kind of being stuck with the
program as it is when we receive it
is we can do something called fine
tuning, which is, we can go
inside the A I
and we can change its
neurons. We can sever
some connections, we can make new
connections the way in which this actually
happens, not particularly
important, but you can do some very drastic
things. All
of this is to say that
A is, are very
odd
technologically,
they can
live on a single computer. They
can be made
to do all sorts of things very
well. They can be
specified, they can be
customized, such that
they can be particularly
responsive to particular
requests, particular context,
etcetera, etcetera. In a way
that would simply be
impossible for pretty
much any other repository
of information that
we've been working with in a digital
context. So
to kind of place
all of this conversation
into a concrete
context. What I
brought here today is a tool
that I've actually
been building for future
focused education.
So this is an example
of a customized A
I this
program runs on my
computer at home. It doesn't
touch the internet, it's not
sending requests to California.
It's not
looking at a database hosted
outside of my apartment in Albuquerque.
It's all local except for the fact
that obviously it's being now streamed
to me. Oh, thank
you that it's
being streamed to my
laptop.
It also
is
particularly attuned
to one of these specific tasks
in particular.
I'm helping with a tool that's meant
to aid with capstones in the
classroom. One of the things that I
found because throughout the spring,
one of my tasks was to
facilitate conversations with
teachers from around the State. I
found that a people were
very reticent to ask
requests or place requests
into a model where they were unsure
of where the request was going.
Um They wanted to feel
that they had control over their data.
And secondly, they
wanted a tool that could do
very specific things. They didn't want an
A I to come in and start
replacing teachers left and right. They
wanted very particular
implementations.
Um This particular one
is meant to aid
teachers with
gaining knowledge about best
practices for conducting capstones
within classrooms. The
particular need being
that with the expansion of
Capstones, there are only so many
experts right now and they feel
inundated by questions from teachers
who are doing these projects for the first
time. These experts
said that if there were some tool that
could summarize
established practices, established
knowledge around Capstones, it
would aid their burden
and help
essentially
promulgate
means of effectively
doing capsules in the classroom to
teachers that don't necessarily have
access to
experts or a body of
knowledge.
So you put
it all together and you get
this tool that can do some pretty
cool things. At least I
help. Um It's
described in the
handout that I distributed.
Um An example of a
customized A I
So when we
ask it a question,
I'm just gonna ask it one from the
handout.
What,
what it's doing is it's going
to a database of
documents that Capstone
experts have accumulated and
it's looking for
information.
So having done so
it produces an output.
And another thing that this
particular tool does
is it actually double
checks its output
before it gives it to the user.
It makes sure that
it's not creating
its own recommendations
that it's only summarizing
stuff that's already been done.
So it double checks, make
sure that it's not inventing new
Captone practices and
it gives an answer. So
some examples of products student
might create for the Capstone projects
include public events
and services, reach papers,
reports, etcetera,
etcetera,
etcetera.
So the reason that this
is helpful
for our particular use
case is
as I have been mentioning, this
is the precise
context and
documents. It's going to
when you just ask a generic
caps, when you ask a
generic A I, when you just ask
chat G BT for,
what kind of things should students
do for Capstones? It
doesn't have an
understanding of the intention
behind Capstones. In New Mexico. It
doesn't have an understanding of
the particular
emphasis on community
oriented projects.
So it just gives general
recommendations like mobile
applications, websites,
robotics, software programs,
etcetera, etcetera.
These aren't bad
recommendations per se,
but it's absolutely
uninformed by the actual
reality of how capstones are being
done in New Mexico and the intention
for capstones.
And when you ask this tool,
any variety of questions,
it does the same thing. It
always refers to the specific
circumstance
behind
the practice of
education within the State, at least
within the database it has
access to and
uses that to inform its
responses rather than just doing
its own kind of generic
computation.
So when you put all this
together, what
we hope we have is
a program that takes advantage
of the particulars,
the particularities
behind A I, the
fact that we can have something
local, the fact that we can have something
customised, the fact that we can make a
tool that educators
would feel more inclined
to place faith and trust
within than simply using
something where it's
computation. Databases
are hosted within
Northern California. For
example, and when you add all these
together, you can make
some things that we
hope will be really efficacious
and making
education more effective and
easier than the State. Thank
you.
>> Thank you Alex.
So um
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee,
it's a pleasure to be here. Thank you
for inviting me,
Alex is uh
as you mentioned, he's
a uh developer
and he's building a
prototype A
I for our
organization, future focussed
education and the
A I that he's developing.
Our goal is
to build a
database
A I is a database
where teachers and
students can access
the best practices,
examples and
of other
Capstone projects, the
experiences of other teachers in
teaching those Capstone projects,
young people and what they're researching
and doing. So, I'll
give you a couple of examples.
So
we have Captone projects
happening around New Mexico right
now that are result of
the Innovation Zone initiative,
result of graduation
requirements changing.
And these Capones an example
would be that
in um
Zuni, New Mexico,
the tribe
has
um worked with the school
district to create a Capstone
project. And the Capstone
project is about cultural
preservation, language,
preservation
and uh the
work on the
persistence of the tribe.
So what will the tribe
be there in the future?
And what do we need to do in schools
to make sure that young people
are able
to continue the values
and the language and the culture
of the tribe. And so students
are doing capsule projects that are
about the long term
um the long
term viability
of their tribe. Another
example would be at Del Norte
High School, Del Norte. High
School has the
largest um
unhoused youth
population in the State.
We have more young people
without homes at Del Norte
High School than we have anywhere else.
Um In New Mexico,
we are, there are young people
doing capstone projects
about youth homelessness.
They're researching those topics
and then they're being placed
in homeless serving
entities. Um
And they're building projects
that um
uh work toward their
graduation. So
they're getting credit for those projects.
They're in, they're in internships,
interning for um
organizations that do
um um
that serve homeless
populations. So those are two
examples of capstones
that are part of
the work that is
happening around New Mexico and
it's an emerging field.
So teachers are learning about it.
Young people are learning about
it. It's a way
for us
to realize
the potential of applied
learning.
And I'll mention that this
initiative came out of
work that um Dr
ornament and
I did
years ago when we
were working on equity and
assessment
and what are more ways
that we can provide learning opportunities to
young people to prove
that they've learned that are
not based in standardized
testing.
And so the capital initiative
is a way for young people
to demonstrate that they're,
that they've learned that they're ready to
mov'e forward. And
through an applied learning process.
And what Alex described was
that these are community based
processes. So kids
learning in community. So they're
doing internships,
they're doing group projects, they're doing
service projects,
ideas like that,
that capture a whole
another way to demonstrate
that you've learned.
So this what
Alex described to you, the database
he just showed you is
the platform that we're
building. So young
people can connect to each
other.
Teachers can connect to each
other, they can learn about best
practices, they can
ask, they can ask the
A I, what
is in, in New
Mexico? What
is a capsule project that
cares for
um language
sovereignty
in Zuni.
What do I need to know about
that?
And because teachers, the
practitioners are adding
the data, they're adding these
capstones and they're adding best
practices, they can learn
from each other and they can access
each other in the development of
their projects.
So it's a platform for
teachers and educators,
it's community-based. And
the idea is that
because as Alex described
the A I model that we're building
is self-contained.
It's not something that
is shipped off to a
company in
California
where the data is really
a commodity.
Instead, it, it
respects and appreciates the
value that it
has
and what our
hope is. And well, let me,
let me take a step back before I get
to what the hope
is
when we,
when we retained Alex
to build the prototype A
I, we did it
because teachers
started asking
how do we do
this in a way that's to
our benefit and to our young
people's benefit and does
not something that, that
replicates cultural
oppression does not
replicate the
um issues we've
had in the past
about um
the colonialism of the, of the
system. And
we're worried that if our young people
are putting data into
an A I that we
don't, that we lose control
over and it's a commodity
to a private company in another
place, then how do we
protect our communities?
And so teachers were bringing these
issues forward. And
so when we brought them together
to help us problem solve
what came out of that was an
idea that we need to have a
self-contained
process where people
can opt in and opt
out, they can share
what they want to share. They don't have
to share everything
that the idea
of um
appreciating
the context
and the sensitivity of
some of the context
needs to be part of the
process.
So what's come out of this now
is as Alex showed
you, there's a prototype
that's being, that's being developed
and it's, it's almost done.
I hope it's almost
done. Um
And our goal
and, and we've been working
with teachers to refine
what we're building so
that their ideas
and about how it's functional for
them is included.
And then we built a task
force with data
science, folks, community,
people, tribal folks
to try to help us
understand what parameters
would look like,
like what, what is
appropriate,
what do local communities
need to have control
over? What should
not be in the public domain?
How do you know, how do you keep it
from being in the public domain if it's
dangerous or sensitive
or overly
um
concerning to the people
that contribute the data?
But at the same
time,
educators want to be
part of this
and they want to be part of it in a
constructive way.
They don't want to do harm,
but they want to be part of it
because they know that it has
value to them as
educators being connected
to one another and it has value
for young people to be connected to
one another to learn from
each other.
So what I'll just, I'll
finish just with a couple of
thoughts
um
that we're
sort of emerging,
maybe we'll call them a
consensus. There's some emerging
consensus about a few
things. One
is that um
we need to have equitable access.
It's not unlike the
internet where we
need equitable access and that
equitable access means
that any A I that's
built, needs to be built in a way that
people can use
it
as opposed to built in a
sophisticated way at a
level that nobody's able
to access it and you don't know how to
use it. The
second thing is
um people need to be able to
opt in and opt out and
if something gets put into the A I,
that's a data collection piece, you
need to and it's sensitive, you
need to be able to back it back
out. So it's not
lost, you
get it out of there if you didn't
want it in there to begin
with.
Yeah.
Um
The last thing I'll mention is
that folks
are coming to this
idea
that we might want to be thinking of
this as a public
um resource
right now. It's a, it's a private
thing. It's a
company that
has runs an A
I and you contribute
your data to a lang large
language model. You've lost
control over the
data.
And part of what
has come out of these
conversations has been,
does this need to be a public
entity? Does it need to be more like a
utility?
And that's been some
of the thinking right now, I wouldn't
say we're anywhere close to a
recommendation but
the way that people are
imagining the
future, they're trying to
imagine something that's good
for the
public
and is Democratic
in a way that lets you put
safeguards in
that um keep
it Democratic where there's
accountability,
where as Alex was
mentioning, it's adaptable,
it's not static, it's
adaptable.
And third that um it's
Democratic in the sense that everybody
gets to participate in the way that
they choose to participate.
So nobody's losing control
over what they want to have
um part of the
Democratic process of
contributing data.
So with that, um
I'm happy to pass it
on to Tom and
uh, Scott,
and I, I appreciate
you asking me to be here.
Thank you.
>> Thank you, Mr. Montalto. I'm glad
you remembered my name.
So Mr.,
Chair Members of the Committee. Thank
you for having us here today.
Um Just so, you know, I'm
Scott Elder. I'm the retiring
superintendent from the Albuquerque public
schools. And
why am I here?
You May recall that in
2021 A PS
was a victim of a pretty
vicious and complex
cyberattack.
And that whole experience
was fairly upsetting for all of
us. But especially me and I began
to really look at our
cybersecurity
and our technology arm
because we recognized
that we were vulnerable
in ways that we hadn't
been before because we've begun
this process of
moving to a 1 to
1 model with our students and
we were going to utilize,
continue to utilize that
more and more
as such. I was
actually looking
at the internet and, and
what was new in education
when chat GP T popped
up. And so I
jumped on and became an
early adapter of
chat GP T
which sounds pretty
impressive until I learned
that it took chat
GP T all of two
months to get to 100
million users. So
I was one of those 100 million,
I thought it was really unique, but
apparently everybody else was there with me.
So, here we go. But
it was fun. So,
um
since then, I have been
involved in
artificial intelligence. In the
discussion, there's an explosion
of literature,
there are conversations
going on across the
country, both at the le
A level and the se A
level. And
as such, Dr Ryan and I
have been involved in
those conversations
uh both from the cybersecurity
and from the A I arm.
So if you
had and just be,
I, I guess I'll introduce
you. Next to me.
This is Dr Tom Ryan. Many
of you know, him, he
was the Chief information
Officer, both in Albuquerque public
schools and in Santa
Fe public schools,
he's recognized as one of the leading
voices in technology
and education in the country.
Uh cybersecurity, he's
developing a voice in A I
and I believe he's one
of the main authors, if
not the main author
of the Generative A I
readiness tool developed
for the coin, the
consortium for school
networking and the Council
of Great City Schools
that's being used across the country
now. So last
year, if you'd invited us to discuss
A I and what it would
be, we'd probably be here talking about
whether or not these kids are
cheating when
they use A I,
how quickly things have
changed because we no
longer live in that world.
We live in a world
where concerns about the
ethical use of A I
or more specifically unethical
use of A I includes
concerns about bias and
discrimination. Mr.
Montalto touched upon that,
but that's a significant issue.
In educational circles,
the concept of social
manipulation, the ability
to use A I
to change
thoughts and perceptions
is tremendously
powerful.
Two of the biggest ones that I
think really impact
education are the use of
deep fakes. A deep
fake technology creates
real hyper realistic
uh fake videos
or audio recordings
which can be used to spread
misinformation, manipulate
public opinion
or to fame individuals.
Um You May have read
in the news recently about a high school
athletic director in the Baltimore
area who was
arrested after he used
artificial intelligence
software to
manufacture a racist
and anti-semitic audio
clip that impersonated the
school's principal.
It just takes three minutes of audio
folks and we
can do it. There's
also concerns about data
exploitation. So
a technologies can be
used to exploit large
data sets containing personal
information without
users informed consent.
This certainly can use the unauthorized
use of data, identity theft
and other privacy breaches. And we're
deeply concerned about this in
educational circles
because we've talked about this before
in terms of
cybersecurity,
school districts are particularly
vulnerable because of what we
pay and who we can hire to to take
care of our cybersecurity.
Um The other thing we're
concerned about is the fact that
we are well aware that educators
just like everybody else
are beginning to use A
I and they're
doing this in a
framework
um with very little
guidance, with no,
with no framework from the
State or from any le
A. Um, and I
think it's a good
thing that they're doing it.
They absolutely should
be looking at a I, because
A, I can do so much.
One of the questions we were asked is
how does A I help in education?
Well, they can do a lot of work around
personalized learning.
You can use A I to
help us individual student or a
small group of students
work on a project
or develop a skill that
they're lacking.
And it will, it's like having an
intern in the classroom
with the teacher. Um
You can use it for
improved grading and
feedback. A I
software has the capacity to
grade assignments and tests and
they can offer instant feedback.
I'm sure that some of you have written
memos and you've run it
through A I just to see
if you could pretty it up a little
bit and I was always
disappointed when I did that and discovered,
oh, this thing is really a lot smarter
than me because I always
sounded better, you know, in some
way you did sound good earlier.
Um So,
and you can use it for data driven
insights. A I can
process and analyze large
volumes of educational data
and helping teachers identify
trends and assess student
performance and make adjustments.
District superintendents
should be using it. Um
Strategic decision making.
It is like having a strategic
decision maker sitting with
you and you can talk and it'll
think of things that you
did not. The
generative A I is
A, it's thinking and
everything you said is absolutely
right. But generative A I
is not going out and just
finding an answer somewhere.
It's creating an answer,
something unique.
That's why they hallucinate. That's
why sometimes they give you answers
that maybe aren't necessarily
true. The hallucination
is not, we used to be just terrified
of hallucinations. Now we've discovered
that's kind of what makes it A I
they can think. It's,
it's, it's thinking along with
you. It's really
good for predictive and analytics
for resource management.
Um I recently
was talking to a group of school
gis planners and they were trying
to figure out what their trends
were. And you can use A
I and look at the data and
you can break down large State amounts
and you can start comparing
where you've got growth in the
city versus where you have
decline versus where
your FTE is going to need to be for
certain schools. And you can
do it fast, it can
reduce some of the tedious
labor. Um So
it really can help
the district and the classroom
in ways that are very powerful.
The reality is a we're
standing on the precipice
of what we believe is
the fourth industrial
revolution.
This is going to change
how everything happens. This
is no longer something that
we wonder about
and let's see what happens, it's
happening and this stuff
evolves every
day, it changes
every day. There's no way anybody
can really call themselves
a super expert on A I because
it's new and two,
it's hard to keep up,
you know. So
um
the prompt engineering is
something we're going to have to talk
about in our school
systems
soon. So
I'm thinking, I was asked
to think a little bit about what the
State can do and how
you can provide some support.
There's four areas I think you
have to consider. One is
political, uh
you need a task force
and you probably needed it yesterday.
And I think Mr. Montalto made
the example of, of how his
communities really wanted to make
sure that the things they
were touching
on that they thought were important
were included in these
conversations and are part
of whatever gets developed out
of this. You also need
somebody to be in charge of this
who is going to take
responsibility for
the growth of A I both in
the SE A and at
the leas um
who are we gonna turn to if you
expect it to just be something we
can add on to people's
existing
jobs
that May be difficult
because this is
too big by,
by itself, if they're doing something
else, this is going to be a full
time job.
Um those task
force and these people can look at
things like setting
principles and guidance
for you, setting some guardrails.
I'll give you an
example.
I am concerned that there are
teachers that are writing
individual IEP plans
or students. And what
kind of information are they putting
into the GP
T? Are they putting
personal identified information?
Probably not, but
the concern exists
also how many teachers are
taking copyrighted
material and plugging that
in to modify it
and thus filling these uh
these a is with
data from
proprietary sources.
Um These are things that
we probably need to think about at the
State. The second area of
concern is operational.
Um I think as a State,
it would be very helpful if we had a
roadmap probably
consisted for 2 to
3 years. And that
would articulate a clear strategy
for the State. And for
leas detailing
a set of initiatives
with milestones,
you know, we just need somebody to plan
and show people the next steps.
They take. One of the
biggest things I'm concerned about
is the lack of training for
staff.
Um
What was happening is
people are grabbing on
to online training or
they're meeting someone or they're
going to a webinar
or a seminar and they're learning
something but we
have no idea of exactly
the credentials of these people
or what they're doing and
what are people are bringing back, what they
think they understand. A I
is, um,
my feeling on
this is when I was running the district
during the pandemic,
people said
you are building
the plane while you are flying
it. That's
where we are with A I right now
it is in the schools.
It's being used and it's being
used widely with
very little framework.
Um I think there's a
technical consideration for
you all. I
do think that you should be
working with the State Cio
and other groups to align
with the leas
to make sure we have
some government standards
and make sure we have standards. Everybody's
reaching, this can reach into
a lot of areas including
procurement, making sure
we because every, every vendor
you heard it from Tim, the
vendors have discovered that A
I is the hot button. They've just
slapped A I stickers on
everything,
but you don't
know exactly
what that A I is
and what it can do with your data
and there's some real impacts
there. The other thing we
are suggesting is at
least at the le A level,
if not at the se A level
that you conduct a comprehensive
A I Readiness assessment,
you need to identify your current
capabilities and infrastructure
gaps within
each district. This
would include an evaluation of
hardware, internet connectivity
and data security measures.
Um Where would something like
that exist? And
could anybody local do
that?
Uh The
rubric I mentioned earlier,
the generative A I readiness
matrix that Dr Ryan
developed is exactly what
I'm referencing. So maybe you'd like to
talk a little bit about the tool
and how you see those steps moving
forward.
>> Thank, thank you for the opportunity.
The co coin
is, is the consortium
of school networks and the Council
of grade school is
a consortium
of large districts across
the country together.
They put together a grant
to how can we help
school districts prepare
for A I? What
questions they should be asking
and how do they start to develop a
plan? So the rubric which
is free and available
at coin.org
gives school
districts six
domains of questions
and maturity levels
to help them assess
more current State
identify where they
want growth to build a
roadmap for them.
Part of it's around leadership
but risk data
security
um legal are
all a part of that, that
tool. So it gives you ability
to assess where you
are on your
own and then
also uh connect
you with resources that
as
doc Mr. Elder
mentioned.
Um this isn't a
technology innovation.
It's a
organizational implementation
of which some of it is
technology and to
have these cross functional
teams and and specifically
smaller school districts do
not have the resources
because that they
wear multiple hats to be
able to really level
plan out and
prepare for this.
So, developing
some statewide guidance,
15 states already
have created
guardrails and policies
around the use of A
I. It's going
to be even more critical for
our smaller districts as they
start looking at. How
do I protect from
cybersecurity because the bad
guys are also using A
I and are becoming
very sophisticated in their
attacks on
our school systems as a
way to get
money. And a lot of
these as Scott didn't
mention aren't being
perpetrated by some
individual in their basement,
but by by
countries, other
countries that are using
this to attack the
United States. So
having statewide
guardrails and
some policies starting to
understand where schools
are and how we can
develop resources that can be
shared. We don't have to
invent this.
We're at our lowest
level A I
use in our
kids' future right
now. It's only gonna get
more. So how do we
get out in front of this so that we're
not fighting it?
Like we didn't do well
with social media and
then we have all of these
negative impacts
and, and in our
schools and with, with our,
our youth. Thank you for
the opportunity to share and I'm
happy to answer any
questions.
>> Are folks
questions.
All right, we
Garrett,
>> thanks Mr. Chair
Dr Ryan. It's good to see you. I was
in your first uh
technology class for
administrators a
long time ago.
>> Good to hear >> you. It
was, it
was um
I have two questions.
First of all, have
any of you worked with
Michael Smith and I CASA
at New Mexico
Tech.
And, and I say that because
there's an effort to make,
look at statewide data
sharing and it's a
lot of the same issues,
guardrails
governance.
>> No, I don't think
at >> this >> point >> we weren't
approached
>> neither
>> a good person
to be connected to all of this.
And I, I can give you contact
the second of all, as I was at
A A I meeting
and um the person brought
up quantum computing
and how it relates to A I.
Do you have any comments on that
this, you know, it's like
just one more variable that's
gonna change
everything.
>> I, I wouldn't worry too much
about it. A is
function on NVIDIA
chips for the most part right now.
GP us more technically,
but we don't
really need a new class of computers
to get A, is to the next
level. We can just keep iterating
on what we're doing now and they're
going to be getting better and better and
better. But just to reiterate
what Dr Ryan said,
we're at the first
moment, you know, all of these
things are still up in the air
and where A I
is going has not been
defined. And there
is an opportunity essentially
to direct
this conversation, direct this
technology in various directions at
this juncture. >> Thank
you,
Representative Garre and,
and uh Chairman
Romero, I, I
would like to introduce our
interns because
they May have some insights as
well for the question
portion. So
Tara Singh
um here, would you mind
standing up Tara?
Thank you and then
Victor Corchado.
So Tara is from
uh North Northeastern
Universities here for the summer
working with us and
Victor's um from
South Valley by Rito
Mesa. So they are
interns for the summer and they're both
working with
us.
>> Represent Guolla.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you.
Uh Thank you for this
presentation. Uh
It really, I
really enjoy hearing
about um the
development of that
um
um
A AE a
software. I don't know how you want to say that
platform, but I guess one
of my biggest concerns with
artificial intelligence is the
bias, right? Because it
gets fed from
whatever is available
and
multicultural education
sometimes is not
like that opening. So
knowing that it's being fed and
provided for the data
to actually being able
to um to produce
or account for,
for the for
the outcomes
that we, that are less
forming a pattern that
is already out there. Um So
my question is um have you
used it already
or is it developing
already?
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Representative
Guila. We have, we've been
demoing it to teachers from around the
State and taking
prompts showing them what the
output is. Um Our
plan is to demo it in a high school
when the academic term resumes in
the fall. Um
But I I just to expand
a little bit on what you said about
context and bias and
algorithms. When we
talk about local A is there's a
philosophical and a practical
advantage. The philosophical
advantage being as we've all
talked about, there's
a deep concern about
where data inputted into an
A I goes. So
if there is
essentially data service and State
and that's as far as the A I is going,
then we
don't have to have
philosophical worry about
whether our data is going to be used to
iterate. The next LL ma
illm is basically
synonym. The second advantage.
The more practical one is to your
point. And I just wanted to
reinforce and expand a
little bit upon
that. There
is always bias in algorithms
because they are bias in humans. And
the algorithms are replicating
us. The advantage
of having a smaller, more
local A I with Democratic
governance in some degree of review
over it is you can step
in and change the
output. That's the beauty of A is
they're unbelievably flexible.
Um So if you want
to essentially push
the types of output
that the A I is generating certain
directions, you give
it information
that essentially pushes it to
think about issues
in a more multicultural lens.
Say that's what
we're trying to do with this tool where
essentially it is based
upon a data set that is pushing
it in a direction
that a generic A I wouldn't.
Um But yes, we're
very cognizant about
because this data set is
so important,
the ultimate
database it's based upon
before we introduce it into a wider
sphere is critical.
And the very cool thing about these
databases is that they're
just comprised of regular documents,
word, docs, powerpoints, PDF
S, etcetera. You don't need a computer
whiz in order to create
them. So
the version that we show to the public right
now is based upon documents
that have been provided to me by experts. But
we're going to think very
conscientiously
with multiple
educators, multiple experts
about what kind of
database do we want this to have access
to? How can we give it
information that confronts the
exact issues that you're outlining
before we introduce them to school in the
fall. >> And thank
you. Thank you, Mr. And, and I guess
that the benefit of
being that small and done local
is humans
can be looking at it
and getting feedback in
the, in, in human ways,
right? Um
Something that I would be interested
in see is comparing
these um
outcomes with
like the most uh
public
um worldwide
use of a of
a active A A
I uh to see what is
the difference, if it's actually
having an impact, this
data that are
feeding
more specific
and it's showing what would be the,
the difference and, and we can
actually be
careful when we are using that
and show that result. This is why
we are talking about things like
that. Thank you so
much. >> Well, if I May,
Mr. Chair Representative Guerilla,
the handout that I've distributed
example of.
So it's, it's comparing
our specific output to the
most broad
open A I and showing the
distinction between what happens when
you give it more expertise.
And one thing I want to mention is
that the specific tool
that we're running, it's using a
really weak A I
if say we were to have
a larger,
more robust
program backed
by public
or larger private entities
than me in my bedroom. Um
It would be running a more powerful model,
it would be giving even more
inflected response based
upon the context it's been given.
>> Thank you. Yeah, I look
at this but I was also thinking the
Capstone when it is evaluated
and, and the projects are actually look
at through those lens
and through other lens to see
what would be the difference in those
outcomes. Thank you
so much and thank you, Mr.
Chair, >> a few
other questions from
folks,
I represent
cum
>> thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you for your
presentation. We have done a
little bit in the legislature. We had a
couple of bills last year. 11
was transparency in our
agencies to,
to see does
there if they're buying
outside um
applications, does it have a
bias or would they show us if it had
a bias that one didn't
pass? And then I believe we
had another one that did create,
look at creating a task force,
but I don't believe that I'm not sure where
that one went, but so we've been looking
at it a little bit. We have
um our, our, our
C CJ
justice Committee
and my Science and Technology
Committee. We've been looking at this and
delving into it. So we
might ask a few of you to come and talk
to us too if you, if you don't
mind. So, but, but we're
starting, but we're not nearly where
we should be. Um
As far as education, we had a
professor out at U and M who
said uh she
two professors one used
A I um
chat G BT to
help students start their
projects. And another one said you can't use
it all until you're done. So
it just depends on the mindset
of instructor, I guess. And that's where we
have to look at how we use
it and when we use it. But
thank you for
all your, all your presentations
learned a little bit more very
interested in yours. I was a computer
programmer before. So I thought
that was pretty cool. Anyway,
that's all I have. Thank >> you,
Mr. Chair. I know it wasn't a
question, but
um just to say that
one would be happy to come and visit
again. And I do think
we are uniquely
poised right now to start
doing something because we
simply can't wait
because it really is exploding
underneath our feet. And
there are some definite
risks for school
districts if we don't get
some guardrails and some guidance
out there. And you know,
the cybersecurity is obviously the big
one and
it's just another
way that people
can. It's right now, it's a very shiny
tool and we're all very excited
about it. Everybody's
jumping into the pool and I just,
this is the time to start
getting ahead of it. Like Dr Ryan
mentioned, we didn't do that for
social media and now we're all where
we are with social media. So,
and I think this is going to have
is just a significant,
if not a greater, significant impact
on what happens in our schools.
>> Yeah.
Any other questions, folks?
All right. So I, I guess
I had a question that might
lead to a couple other ones. But
with the, with the work that
you all are doing,
you all had mentioned about
um information
that
could
would, May
be shared
and information that May
not be shared. Can you give an
example of
that
>> Mr. Chair that I can give a
couple of examples? So
we uh
as I mentioned, we just
finished a round of
Capstone projects at Del Norte
High School. Those
those are conducted
by young people,
they involve sensitive
information about those young
people. We
clearly would not
um want to put that into a
database about the specifics
or even how those young people
could be identified. So,
in a sort of personal
identity way, that would be
one example.
Um
The other example
is we've been
super
um
conscious of making
sure that we have
uh native tribal
folks in these
conversations
and the complexity of
that is significant.
And I
understand
from those
folks that
not all data is
for public consumption.
So there are things
that are
sacred
that are not to
be, that May
be part of a young person's
capstone
because it is about
their identity and
their
um even
a rite of passage into
adulthood
and they May want, and they
May be demonstrating that
they're ready to graduate in that way.
But that data is sacred
and it shouldn't be in
and it shouldn't be in a
large language
model database. It
shouldn't be outside of the tribe. It
should be something that's kept
separate and held on to
for its um because
it's sensitive and because
it's um
um owned by
the community as opposed to
being in a public space.
So this would be two examples.
Um I could
give
>> uh Mr. Chair,
the there are several pieces
of information
that you could put
into a public
GP T like a check GP
T as opposed to
a GP T
that's behind a firewall.
Um You could put
medical information
in, in helping
trying to Mr. Elder
has these medical issues and I,
what recommendations? Well, that
now becomes a public thing.
Um So anything about
their, their personal
identifiable information, their
special education, their
medical um
uh discipline
types of things. There
are a lot of those
kind of components. You got to be
careful that you don't overshare
that information. When
you Mr.
Elder referred to
uh proprietary
information, you buy content
or lease content from a
company and then you put
that in to personalize the
instruction, you just compromise
the IP of
that company
and now you can put yourself
into a lawsuit
kind of a situation
or intellectual property
going down those paths. So
there's a lot of
ways that a person
doing things
um to try
to benefit could be over
sharing information that now are
part of a public data set
that can become a
problem for the district in the
future or
allow
uh bad
uh actors to
use that information
to um
harass and harm
uh people within the school
district.
>> And I
appreciate those answers probably
brings up a lot more questions.
The last one I would ask
about this though. Um
because Doctor Ryan, you bring up an
interesting point, like
will the work that you all
are doing need
to be
edited filtered
by the individual that might be
submitting their capstone?
Or is that something
that the work you all doing
would be able to help
out with that? Because
Doctor Ryans kind of pointing out
like it could be
that I might be over
sharing something that I
shouldn't be. And then all of a
sudden it's available to
everybody.
>> Mr. Speaker. I've
kind of conceived as my role in this
process as someone
to interpret what's
possible with A I
and what is happening
with A I and to leave decisions up
to others right now, my
tool does not retain any
information, it doesn't retain the
prompts, it doesn't retain
basically anything. Um
The only static
data it has access to
is the database.
Um It could,
that's just not a decision
that I feel that is really mine to
make, but we could
have as it is right now,
a system that simply
discards the prompts
as soon as it's been request as soon as
it's been provided.
>> And Mr. Chair, one thing I would
say and answer your question, which is a
very educated
question
is you should always edit
what is prepared by the A
I. And that's where we get back
into the the
the need for training
both amongst our staff and our
students. You should
never take anything.
A I told you with a grain
of salt and I know that one
of the big things that people worry
about is will A I replace
educators? Will it replace
adults? It never
will, it will never
replace educators, it will never
replace people who do these
jobs. It
will help them do the
jobs more efficiently. It
will help them reduce some of the
tedious nature
of, of the work
sometimes,
but you always have to
be there. We, we like to
think of this as
intelligence
accelerated.
You're an expert in your field,
you produce something with
chat, you want to look
at it and make sure that it's what you
wanted and that what you
intended is produced
and that's where the people
always be part of the
work.
>> Cool. Well, Thank you all so much.
I really appreciate you all joining
us. Thank you.
All right folks. Um
So for this
evening,
under your announcement,
tab Members,
um we need to
meet at five,
so we're going to be
before five if possible,
but five, if not,
you're late. And
uh as yeah,
yeah, train
will not be waiting. So
this is for Members,
Members only if you have a plus
one. That's awesome. You should have given
up that information
already to folks.
But, uh, we'll see you before
five preferably.
All right. And
then we'll start tomorrow
at nine o'clock.
