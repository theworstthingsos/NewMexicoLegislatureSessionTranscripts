Within two years or
less. And you're waiting six
months to add a case to a
person and you're
not giving them the full caseload for
maybe a year to 18
months, by the time
they're taking on a full caseload,
they're getting ready to walk out the
door. Um
And that's a really, really hard
way to run a system
so that professional
development is really critical to make sure
that they're well prepared and well prepared
early. So the pacing
of what you're giving people is critical,
mixing in your real life experience,
your theory, your practice,
mixing and mentorship,
connecting seasoned
staff with new staff is
critical. Um
How are you integrating
actual real-life parents
who have experienced the system into your
training is really critical. It
gives staff an opportunity to
understand what it's like to be
part of both sides of the system,
to understand what it's like to
um be investigated, to understand
what it's like to not have your
Children for a period of time and build that
empathy. Um
have young people who are part of the system,
be part of the training as well,
right? Have them understand what it's like to
be a fos to be a youth in
foster care. Those things really make a
big difference.
Um It also ends
up um
for our staff
ended up being the most popular
things that they did,
you know, in a small state like New
Hampshire, I had the opportunity to actually sit down
with all of my staff at the end of training
and talk to them when I was in New Jersey. That
was an impossibility because it was such
a big system. But in New Hampshire, I could
do that and
invariably at the end of training,
that was the thing that they liked better than
anything else that we did.
Um is an
amazing experience.
Another really, really important thing
for longevity of staff is
Contin thinking about how you're
continuing your education
for staff and there
is availability and I'm not
sure whether New Mexico currently does this,
they very well may but there is the
ability to
um offer programs
that are federally reimbursable
75% where you can
pay for staff to get their advanced
degrees
through the
title four E program
and have the federal government reimburse a
significant portion up to
75% of those costs.
So it's a good way
to incentivize staff to
stay with the agency over time
to pay for continuing
education.
>> Thank you. Next chair.
Is that the cost
to the employee
or is it the cost to the
employer that is being
reimbursed?
>> So the way that the program was
developed in the jurisdictions that I worked
in and a lot of others, the
state paid for the
tuition and the federal government
reimbursed 75% of
the cost that the state put
out. So the employee
didn't pay
anything.
>> So, so
just for clarification,
so the state
is paying
for the employees tuition.
The feds are
reimbursing them three quarters
for tuition only.
So no other kind
of costs
related to the
education.
>> I think it might have included. I,
I'd have to double check. You might
have been able to include fees and books and
stuff in there. I'm not quite sure, but certainly
the, the tuition costs I'm
positive >> of
and I think Rachel,
I can't see if she's
there. She's,
she's done quite a
bit of work on four E
and, and one of the
issues we want to make sure
we cover with the secretary today
is, are we really
recouping the full
possibility
of, of federal
participation in the four E
program administrative
costs can be covered as well.
A portion of certain
ones. And, and, and
apparently the
department,
did you want to say anything about that, Rachel?
Because apparently the department
didn't really
draw down all
they might have last
year.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair,
administrative costs and,
and time off work costs.
There's travel, there's a lot of
other things. So
>> Mr Chair, to your
question, there
are challenges right now
in the agency and drawing down
foster care administration
costs. The CF
may talk to you all about
that. In addition to that,
though, we are likely under
title for um
you all did
appropriate through the
grow some money
specifically intended
to pilot a program
to incentivize
staff to obtain a
master's in social work.
And so that could be
leveraged
um to kind of
pilot and develop a program and
then potentially
um pick up some of the costs
through title four,
but that will go into effect next
year.
>> Thank you,
Rachel.
>> OK.
Another key area
when you're thinking about child
welfare, workforce
and retention is staff
workloads and
caseloads.
Um This is
critical again, I can
reflect on my own personal
experience.
Um When I
first arrived in New Hampshire
caseloads were 55
per case per
caseworker,
uh national,
you know, expectations
or the staff should be carrying
depending on kind of your
expectations, depending
on how you distribute
other work associated with the
case. Somewhere
in the, you know,
high or low 10,
you know, low teens
tens.
Um And we were
at about
55
we were able to get that
down through lots
of different efforts. And
when I left, we were down to about
15, which wasn't
quite where our goal was, we set
our goal at 12.
Um But we were able to get that
down radically through
lots of hiring, through
retention efforts
um doing the same types of things
that we were just talking about here
and through the other
side of the equation, right. It's the
equation of building up
your staff, but also
reducing the number of cases
that are coming in the front door.
Right. So it's the prevention
and it's the increase in your,
your workforce. It's both sides
of that. You can't just do it from
one side, you have to do
both.
Um
So
focusing on that, making
sure you get staff to a place where they
have a reasonable caseload
so that they can actually accomplish the work
that they're supposed to accomplish is
critical. If they don't feel like they can
accomplish what they're supposed to
accomplish, they're going to burn
out immediately.
Another way to think about it, if you
can't get to
the caseload that you want to get
to, you can think about how
much work is associated with
the case. So what other types
of roles or support can you
offer to staff to reduce the amount
of work associated with the individual
case? So what other types
of support can you offer staff? So
other things that we have
done that I did in
New Hampshire in New Jersey, that other
jurisdictions have done was
think about other types of ancillary support
within your office, think about
clerical supports that you're
offering. So how
are those folks being
used?
Um Do you have
enough of those folks that can pull some
of those responsibilities that
oftentimes caseworkers
are doing paperwork that somebody
else could do.
Um when they're out meeting with
families thinking
about um,
paraprofessional type
support and
paralegals who
could be doing some of the court type
reports that a lot of times
caseworkers in many states are
being asked to
draft and write when
you could have a paralegal doing that
work and pulling some of that
casework. Um,
you know, while while your staff are
out in the field, doing more of that
casework, social work type
work, thinking about
nurses that are
working to handle some of the health
care um
concerns that
are associated with kids in foster
care that oftentimes
caseworkers are being asked to
do again, other types
of paraprofessionals who might be able to do
visits between take kids
to visits and things like that or
transportation. All of
these are tasks that caseworkers
are often asked to do in many
systems that take a
lot of time
that eat away
at all the tasks that they have to
accomplish. So
while their caseload may still be
higher, if you take away some of those
tasks by having other people step
in to do that work, they might
be able to handle more of what they're being
asked to do and be
able to last a little bit longer.
Other critical roles you can think
about are people who are specializing
in some highly complex areas. So you
take some of your more seasoned
staff and really train
them to be specialists in some
really complex areas like around
family and inter and
interpersonal violence,
right? Domestic violence type
specialists, or substance
use disorder specialists, and really
get some of your more seasoned staff
to specialize in those really complex
cases so that they
can they can kind of carry
that while some of your
younger staff who are still
trying to kind of step up
and grow into the role,
are able to learn some of those
things. Um And
by doing that, you're able to kind
of decrease kind
of the pressure on the
staff that you're trying to bring up
and you're giving your more seasoned
staff the ability to, to
take on the more complex
roles.
Um So while that might not always
decrease the actual caseload,
the number that a staff
is carrying, it makes the burden
a little a little lighter of
carrying that number of
cases. And
with that, we can turn to the next
page.
So the other couple important
parts about workforce
retention are
around a supportive supervision
structure and physical
and psychological safety,
really around
supervision. Things that I
think are really important here
are
especially when you have
had high turnover, you have
to hire a lot of staff.
You need to have a sup a supportive
supervision structure where supervisors
are not just focusing on
things like um
compliance and check
boxes, but really offering
a clinical supervision where they
understand the
work itself, they understand the
needs of the families and they're able to
help guide the staff through
managing the families
in order to do that,
supervisors can't be supervising
too many people. So
our rule of thumb is a supervisor should
be supervising no more than five
people. Because if
they were supervising more than that, they couldn't
understand the dynamics of the
families that they were working with.
Right. If every staff
is working with 12 families,
which was our goal, even though most
of them had more than
that
and every supervisor was supervising
five staff, then you were expecting
that supervisor to understand the
dynamics of
70 families.
That's a lot for a supervisor to
understand.
But they had to, if they were going to be
able to meaningfully offer
clinical supervision
to all of the staff,
and that's really important, especially when
you have a young workforce,
right? So even that sounds pretty
overwhelming to me.
Um, so really making
sure your supervisors were not overwhelmed
is really critical,
um, and making sure that they have
some type of model that they're following
some type of supervision model
and that it's not just supervisors
and there's lots of good ones. I'm not gonna
publicly endorse any
one model over another. Although I'm happy to
talk to some folks off records about
some good ones. But,
um,
but making sure that they're following a
common model across the state. So you
have common practices
across the state around how folks
are doing their business is really
important. And then the last
thing that's really important is physical safety
and psychological safety, right?
Physical safety, like
really a no brainer, right? If people
are not physically safe, they're not going to show
up to work. This is
really dangerous work. You're asking
folks to go into homes,
um, oftentimes homes that law
enforcement is fearful of going into. And
oftentimes
without
the type of protection that law enforcement
typically has. Right. And they're relying
on their ability
and their training to
connect with people and de escalate
situations in order to be safe in
those situations.
Um, And you have to
give them the, the license and
authority to be able to step back
when they don't feel safe and
to be able to call help, call
for help if they need help in a
situation and they don't feel
safe. Um
Psychological safety is also
really, really critical.
Psychological safety. Is this
idea that
one will not be punished or
humiliated for sharing
ideas, questions,
concerns or mistakes.
Child welfare
is a very high
stress and a very high
risk environment.
If you err in one
direction,
you're gonna violate a family's
constitutional
rights,
you're going to cause trauma to a
family
and you're gonna unnecessarily separate
a child from their parents.
If you err in the other direction,
something really awful could happen
to a
child.
In our political press, our
political environments and our press
environments are not very
forgiving of errors
in either
direction.
And oftentimes
when there is an error in either
direction rather
than trying to
really understand the
complexity. We very
quickly look for
a politically expeditious
solution. And
just to fix blame to
somebody
and look to punish somebody
as a way to just get
out of the pressure
of that problem that we found
ourselves in. Instead of
trying to really understand all of
the systemic
pressures that lead to those bad
outcomes
because it's such a high
pressure
situation.
In order to really create psychological
safety, you have to be really
deliberate about
creating it. It's not
gonna happen naturally and it's not gonna
happen just because you have a nice
leader at the top,
you have to really be deliberate
about it
and it has to be modeled at all levels
of the organization,
but honestly, not even just at all
levels of the organization, it has to be
modeled outside
of the organization.
It has to be modeled in
the way that a governor's
office acts
when there's a bad
thing that happens in the system. It has
to be modeled in the way that the legislature
acts when a bad
thing happens in the system.
And it has to be modeled in the way that an
editorial board acts
when a bad thing happens in the system.
And that doesn't happen in
almost any state almost
ever.
So, creating psychological
safety is a really,
really hard thing to do
within a child welfare
system. It's
also a really, really
important thing to do.
If you want to create an
environment where you're gonna
have staff who are
going to be honest to
say and
speak up when something's not
right. And when
you're working in such a high risk
situation as
we do in child welfare, you
need staff to
feel comfortable to speak up when
something's not right.
So recognizing that
tension and trying
to create those
environments is really,
really important and a
key way to do that is,
you know, when things
don't go well
before we rush to
judgment to
take a moment and try to
understand the complexity
around it and get to the bottom
of what really happened before
we immediately a
fixed blame to
the person who had the
case or even
the leader who was at the top of the system,
who had the case, but really
understand the situation before we
get to that point.
And with that, I'm going to move on to the
next area.
So I'll pause in case folks
have questions about
workforce.
>> I, I just want to caution
the members. We, we probably
need to move on because we're,
we're running way behind.
And so if you could hold your questions
from here on, that would be
better.
>> Excellent. And what, what is
my time frame? So
I,
>> we had originally booked you till
10 and we just now hit 10.
So,
but, but
we, we've
got some flex in the schedule.
So go ahead and take, why don't you take
another 15
minutes?
>> Ok. So next section I'm gonna
talk about is the role of children's behavioral
health.
I want to point to a couple states
in particular
where
by building out really
robust systems of care
for children's behavioral
health, we've actually
seen states be
able to create the
lowest utilization of
group care by a child welfare
agency in the country. By
far, the
lowest utilization of
juvenile facility
usage per
capita by a juvenile
justice agency
by far and the
lowest youth suicide
rate
in the country by
far.
So if you turn to
the chart
here that says New Jersey
Group
Care,
what you see here
is data that
shows um
a timeline, a 20 year
timeline of group
care utilization by the child
welfare agency in New
Jersey.
And the national
average of group
care by child
welfare agencies
and the national average
in 2021
which is when we last pulled this
data, the feds actually just released the
2022 data
um and it's comparable to
this. We just haven't updated the
chart yet.
Um The national
average is
48.7
per 100,000 Children in
the population. New
Jersey's is 8.6
per 100,000 in the
population.
And >> just, just
to be clear when you're saying
group care here, are you talking about
residential treatment?
That's correct. Specifically
that mental health
group care. >> Yeah, I'm talking
about a child welfare agency
placing a child
within some type of institutional
setting. So yeah, it could
be a residential treatment
center, whatever different
states use different language for this. But some
type of group
setting of some
sort could be for treatment
purposes or not treatment purposes but
group settings. >> So it would
include what we used to call
here. Group homes
>> could be. Yes. Yeah.
Any, any purpose,
anything other than a family based
setting.
Yeah.
And the way
that New Jersey did this actually was
not by building
out
changes, radical changes
within their child welfare system.
The way that they did it was building
out services
through their children's behavioral health
care system that was available
to all Children in the
state
across the entire state
that also served the child
welfare system but was not within
the child welfare system.
And that's not how most states
operate. Most states
structure a lot of this within
their child welfare system
or at least key components of
it.
And a lot of states structure these
things where
you can access a child, can
access things up to say
outpatient care pretty
easily. But things
beyond that, they set a
pretty high barrier for
things like
um enhanced
care coordination with wraparound,
right? So that's
a service where if you have a child
who's got some pretty intensive
behavioral health care needs,
you have a team of folks who come
together
and it includes the
family, it includes the young
person and it
includes clinical
folks who are working. It includes
school folks. It includes
anybody that the family thinks important
and it includes a clinical
person whose job it is to pull
everybody together
and they're coming up with a plan for.
How do you coordinate all of the things
in this young person's life in order
to make
sure that you're lining
everything up to work,
right? All of their services, all of
their education, all of everything
so that it all is working in
a way that works for this young
person services
like that are available in a lot of
states, but typically
only available
within a child welfare system,
within a juvenile justice system
or once a child is,
is diagnosed with a
severe emotional disorder at a really
high level. What New
Jersey did differently was they made
access to that available?
Really just for kids who
identified as
having a moderate
behavioral health need,
not requiring even a specific
diagnosis for a serious
emotional disorder.
And that was really almost the
key was making those
things available early
before system involvement.
And before deep end
diagnosis. And
by making that
making peer support
for parents and youth available,
early making
in-home clinical services
so that the clinician can
come to the house and work with the kid and
family. And when I
said earlier, there's a difference between
children's behavioral health and adult
behavioral health. That's really
it, children's behavioral
health doesn't happen absent
to family. There's
no such thing as just taking a child
away from their family and fixing them
and bringing them back.
It's always about the
family.
Every intervention is about working
with the kid and working with their
family within that context
and within that setting, there's
no, you never remove a child
and fix them and send them back home. It
just never ever works.
You always have to be part of that setting, which
is why doing this work in the home
is so much more effective, especially
when you have a child who's demonstrating
high level needs.
And then the last key piece of
this
was um having
flexible funding available
within that wraparound team
in order to do things
like um
provide funding for
prosocial activities for the young
people. And that might sound like a
luxury, right? You're paying
for little league, you're paying for
yoga, you're paying
for whatever auto
repair, it doesn't matter what it is,
it's whatever the young person wants to
do but why
that's so important and this
was started back in 2000
before people really understood this
stuff. But
why this is so important is that a lot of
times what you're actually seeing here, it's
not clinically diagnosable
behavioral health. It's
actually trauma.
And what we understand now
about treating trauma is
that most of treating
trauma. It's about
relationships and it's about
building healthy
relationships that helps rewire
the brain around
trust and
building healthy relationships. For
young people is about
putting them in healthy
environments, doing
things that they love with other
young people doing things that they
love,
right? So you put young people
who are exposed to serious trauma
in a setting where people that care about
them are talking about. How do we get
you into places
with other people who care about doing
things that you care about? Right? That's what
wraparound does
and then you put them into
whether it's little league or auto repair
or yoga where they're with other
young people doing things that they care
about and
you're healing trauma, right?
There's also a role for the clinical
interventions and that's what the
in-home clinical work does,
right? That's another piece of the
puzzle. But that
prosocial activity is a
really, really critical
component and I'm sorry, it looked
like you had a question. So
>> that, that does not include
National Dance Institute
Dancing though. Does
it? There's
a lobbyist for that group
grinning from ear to ear right
behind
you,
>> it is whatever the young person
is passionate
about.
Um So anyway,
all that's to say is
this is all it
had a profound impact on the child
welfare system. The child
welfare system has the lowest
use uses of group care in the
country also has the lowest use
of foster care in the country. By
far, there are more reasons
than this for that,
but it
was an intervention that was done on the behavioral
health side, not done on
the child welfare side that led to that
result. >> Did they use
Medicaid for that or they, it
>> was Medicaid
funded and that was really the critical point
of this, right? If you look at
this timeline and I'm not gonna walk through
it because we have a lot of folks
can read this later. It
started off with AAA grant
back in 1999
which is a federal
grant
to create the system.
But what was really smart
was they moved all of the funding
to Medicaid so
that it could be sustained over time because the
Samsa grants were time limited
dollars,
right?
But Medicaid ultimately had to
fund it ultimately, right?
Because eventually the formula,
the Sams a grants, a
discretionary time limited
grant that's gonna go away.
Medicaid can fund it
for 20 years, 40
years, right.
That's the real trick.
So
now the next thing that I wanted to talk
about here was
in New Hampshire. We basically did the
same
system
but overheated into juvenile
justice.
So in New
Hampshire and there's actually a podcast
that's being released next month
about some really awful
things that happened at our juvenile
facility. Going back from the 19
sixties through
the 19
nineties, early two
thousands,
there was a lot of
um
interest in closing
the youth
justice
facility.
Um, but to do so, we had to reduce
the census pretty radically.
And the idea that we had
was we were basically gonna do the same thing that
New Jersey did around child welfare
through a children's behavioral health system. Using
the same model I just talked about,
but we were going to
intentionally direct it towards
the juvenile justice system
and that's what we did and it
worked and given that we have
not much time, I'm
not gonna spend a lot of time talking about
how we did it. But that's
spelled out here
in the, in the timeline
about how we integrated the same
types of services and supports
through children's behavioral health care
system. Focusing
both on the clinical aspects
and the trauma treatment aspects
in a behavioral health care system
overlaid them into a juvenile
justice system and were
able to radically drive down
the need to use
an incarceration setting to where New
Hampshire currently has the lowest
rate of youth incarceration in the
country that's both for
committed and detained youth
where they have moved
from when I first moved. They're having a
total of 70 kids
um detained and committed
to having only 12 kids in the
entire state detained and
committed.
So again, the next slide
here that I'm just
gonna kind of brush over because I
talked about this, but this spells out
with those kind of five
component, those
five core component services
are, right?
The one that I didn't really talk about here
that is also really important to
this. I talked about the in
home supports. I talked about
the wraparound services.
I talked about peer support
and I talked about
um the flexible
funding for the
for
um
for the um
uh prosocial
activities. I didn't talk about
mobile response and Stabilization
services. That's the
other really critical component.
And that's the idea that you have
clinical folks
who are able to respond and
go out to
work with young people and
it works for adults as well.
But we're talking about young people today
rather than law enforcement for
when folks are, you know,
dis deregulated.
Um particularly when you're talking about
young folks who have had trauma
behaviors of disregulation
are very common.
Um And having clinical
folks go out instead of law
enforcement is a way
to deescalated that
moment
to not have
that child end up
removed from their home, not
have that child end up unnecessarily
in the justice system
stabilize the moment,
get the family calm, get
the young person calm
and the stability stabilization
service component of that in
this model
is that they
remain involved for 60
days while you're making sure that that
family is connected to the right
resources
to sustain over
time. So it's not
just deescalating in the
moment, it's remaining
involved until you make sure the family
has what they need so that they
don't pop back up two days
later and then people get frustrated
and then they finally call the police and then you
get the justice system involved and everything
else, right? So it's
the remaining involved that's also
critical.
>> I think we're going to have
to and
I'd love to hear about the juvenile
justice issues but, but
we'll have to hold off
some other time for that
because I want to give the committee a chance
to ask some questions.
But also then we have other presenters
here that we want to
get to a representative
block question.
>> Yes. Thank you, Mr Chairman. Thank you
so much for being here today. I just had a
couple of quick questions for
you in New
Hampshire
>> when you're not speaking, can you
turn your mic
off?
>> Got it. Thank you,
Mr Chair and uh madam
vice chair. So New
Hampshire seems like
it's very good what you guys
are doing, what they are doing
there. Uh Do they have
an ombudsman office
that's overseeing
the day to day activities
and what does that look
like? Versus
other states,
madam Mr
Chairman?
>> Yeah, they created an office
of the Child Advocate
actually. Um
that started actually right
after I arrived
in the State of New Hampshire.
Um the office of the
Child Advocate in New
Hampshire has pretty broad
jurisdiction over
children's services pretty
broadly.
And um so
in some jurisdictions, it's just child
welfare. It's just certain areas
in New Hampshire, it's defined pretty
broadly. The
position
is
there is a standing
legislative, it's actually not just
legislative, it's a
standing
um committee
that includes
uh
bipartisan
bicameral legislative
members and community
members that are appointed by members
of, by leadership of both
chambers called the
Children's Oversight Committee.
That committee
recommends
every four years a
person to serve as the child
advocate to the governor. They
recommend actually three people to serve
as a child advocate to the governor.
The governor then selects among
those three people who will serve as
the child advocate. The
child advocate does report
for the purposes of
like, you know, like of
pay and everything else. They're part of the executive
branch. The child
advocate does regularly meet with the
governor's staff. The child advocate
does also
meet on a
monthly although they take
the summers off um
with that oversight board as
well, the Children's Oversight committee.
So there's kind of
oversight both within the executive
branch and the legislative branch of
the role and the child
advocate I believe can only be
dismissed for cause.
So it's not like
it's a role that
it's, it's in the executive
branch, but it's somewhat independent
from, from
the executive branch in that
way.
>> Ok. Thank you, Mr Chairman. Thank you
so much for that. That, that
seems interesting the way it's set up
in New Hampshire. I'd love to just see
what their model is and I'm sure I'll
google it so I won't take everyone's
time. But Mr Chair,
I'm wondering. So you
said broad oversight
and broad authority. Is it
mainly an advisory
role? Let's just say they found
like, like in an
audit, you find red flags. Is
it something like that that is then
addressed by the legislature
or do they have the power to
make those executive
level decisions to change
certain policies right
there on the spot, Mr
Chair?
>> Yeah, it was,
it was, um, it
was advisory. So
it happened in a few different
ways. I mean, we always had a
pretty strong relationship so
we met regularly as well
when I was the director and the child
advocate I met
at least once a month, probably more than
that because we also worked on work groups and
committees together on all types of
topics. Um,
but they also wrote reports
and annual report, plus topical
reports on issues.
Um,
and, um, but it
was advisory, they didn't have the
authority to actually make the
changes, they made
recommendations
and, you know, the
legislature could enact legislation
based off those recommendations, the
agency could change
policy, practice procedure
based on those recommendations, but it was
advisory.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you so much for
that. And I think that's important
at least to have some
sunshine right on what's
happening and ensuring
that these kids are being protected,
etcetera, and Mr
Chair. Just one quick point.
I don't know if you want to comment on it. I think
it's good that you talked about
the media's role and then
us public policymakers
role in ensuring
that we don't just respond to a
crisis, but
we make sure that we have a lasting
impact that goes to the heart
of what happened and why
this child was being abused
or something like that.
So Mr Chair,
I understand that
last year we had a report
in the media about
these
people who work at CYFD that
they were caring for these kids in
Roswell and they were
being abused
by the kids that they were looking
out after because they were
sleeping in the offices. And that's
a huge problem that we have in the
state of New Mexico just having
facilities and places for these
people to go. So Mr
Chairman I'm just
wondering
has New Hampshire seen
similar kinds of
things like that? I guess
that's my three minutes, but
I'm just wondering if you'd like to
respond.
>> Yeah, I mean, I, I don't know anything
really about New Mexico system. So
be careful that. I'm not not
commenting on that. Um
What I can say is there
have been a couple instances
of challenges finding
locations for Children in
New Hampshire. Um but
nothing like what we've
seen in other jurisdictions.
Um
uh New
Jersey, I don't think has found
any situations like
that where they've had kind of this telling
or, or office
sleeping type of phenomena.
Um
>> You,
thank you, Representative
Representative Thompson, followed
by Representative Kates and
Representative Chavis.
>> Thank you Mr Chair and thank you
for your presentation.
So when you were talking about
supervision, it just
brought back to my mind under
the um for
development specialists under
the Family Infantil
program, they
put in a rule that you
had to have, I don't know, an
hour a week of,
of supervision
and rather than
people rather than
it being something that people
wanted to do to,
to learn to
bounce ideas,
it just became one
more box
to check and so
everybody hated it
because it was just busy
work we don't have to
for. So I guess my
my point is that,
you know what sounds like a great
solution may have
depending on the
implementation
may have more
negative consequences
than, than positive.
So we can't just say,
oh, you must do a
and then it's busy work
and and it doesn't mean
anything anymore. So just
just I guess a reminder to
all of us. Thank you, Mr
Chair,
>> Representative
Kate.
>> Thank you, Chair and thank you
very much for your presentation.
I have two quick questions.
One is you talked about
how um each supervisor
has five staff.
I'd like to know how
robust was New
Hampshire's
internship
apprenticeship programs.
Did those five
staff that were being supervised
any of those looking for their
social work hours
as uh so that
you because you talked a lot about
mentoring and uh
and inspiring and
retaining uh
the young in
there. I know that um
it takes an
enormous amount of supervisor
hours to
help social workers get
their hours and
yet there is no extra
pay for
the agencies or the
supervisor as they're
doing it. And so I was
wondering if New Hampshire had any
special laws or processes
that address that?
>> Yeah, I would
so no, New Hampshire did
not. I wouldn't look at New Hampshire
is very much emerging in that space.
I would look to Connecticut
or New Jersey more for models around
those things. Um
Connecticut actually has really strong
programs around those
things. >> Thank
you, chair and thank you for that. I
will be looking that up and
I might be reaching out to you.
The other thing is, is, um,
how do you ensure
staff safety?
So, um I've
supervised, I've run
programs where social
workers or providers are
going into families' homes that
could be very much dangerous.
Maybe something as simple
as bedbugs may
also be somebody
who is under a substance
in the back bedroom that
is not supposed to be there.
So I could
make internal policies
for my organization.
That safety
first was
important to me
and that I let
the providers make that
decision of whether or not they didn't
have to prove it to me that they were
safe. They just had
to tell me they weren't safe
to be able to leave. But
many of them who came from other
agencies was like, no,
I'm bound by law. I
have to provide services
for the Children. So I would
train them to, well,
can we meet in a park? Can
we meet someplace so that you do have
safe? What sort
of actual,
not just you, they got a
great supervisor,
what sort of actual
laws or rules were in
place to ensure that
staff felt
safe?
>> Yeah. So
the,
the, what we did
was, um, it was actually
much more like what you were talking
about. It was that staff were
trained that they, if they did not
feel safe, they did not have to
go in, they would call back to their
supervisor and then there would
be a plan set in place, either
to have
multiple staff go out if that
was the solution or to have law enforcement
accompany them. And
we had great relationships with the law
enforcement to be able to go out and do that
if it was, if it was necessary.
Now, it was quite interesting was
that, um, a lot
of times staff felt that law
enforcement actually heightened the
safety risk instead of
reducing the safety risk.
Um especially when you had
our more seasoned staff who understood
their families and knew their families.
Um, but
that was, you know, it really was
much more along the lines of
having well-trained seasoned
staff who understood
their, their families, understood their
communities and understood,
um, you know, the dynamics of where
they were. But it is
a, it's, it's a,
it's a high risk
situation
oftentimes and
I think there are many days where
folks felt lucky,
um,
much more so than,
than we felt comfortable
with.
>> Thank you very much. Did you forget
to set the timer with me? Is
it?
>> Thank you, Representative
Representative Chavez.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
I wanted to go
back to slide number
eight where you talk about preventative
models in child welfare. I, I
think my own personal opinion,
I don't think we do enough of that.
Um And so what I wanted
to do is ask about,
um, you know, using
schools as,
as preventative
models in New Mexico, we have a law.
All right. In Albuquerque, I guess
we have many schools that are
community schools. So they have family
resource centers. Some of
them have health clinics
that have
psychologists where kids
can go from the classroom
to an appointment
and not have to drive across town to
do that. So
do you think that that's a model
that we really need to look
at and, you know, put more
resources into?
Um And then my other question
also has to do with
kids in
schools. We are
dealing with
a
um situation
where kids bring guns
to school and are,
you know, the response
has been zero
tolerance and
entry into the
juvenile justice system.
So what other
alternatives
can we use to respond
to those kids who are
obviously
um
suffering from some kind of
trauma and our
response isn't
necessarily what I think it
should be.
>> Right? Yeah. Thank you for both of those
questions. Um One, I
think certainly the idea of
incorporating schools, I
mean, schools are kind of the hub for
a lot of families
of their kind of social
service networks and for a lot
of kids, right? So incorporating schools
into that and I think everything
that I talked about on that list
of ways that we think
about supporting and strengthening
families.
Um
You think about what works
in your communities and you build from
there, right? None of that is intended
to be as I said in the beginning,
right, the prescriptive
list of everything. It's
the, it's where you
kind of start thinking about
how do you build out for what works in
your community and your context.
There's no kind of one size fits
all. It's, it's working,
working with what you have and it sounds like you
have something that's working.
So you certainly build from there
and try to just meet these needs.
The other issue about,
about, um, guns
is really tricky. You
know, we're seeing in the
data that that's kind of the
number one reason that kids are
entering um,
juvenile justice systems
around the country.
And when you
have kids,
when we talk to kids
in research
about why they're carrying
guns, they're saying they're
carrying guns because they don't feel
safe.
And we've done a
lot in this country
to tell kids, not just
kids, to tell people
that when you don't feel
safe, you should be carrying a
gun.
So I think
we probably need to reconcile
these messages that we've sent to
people about
carrying guns.
And if we're sending a
message that if you don't feel safe that
you're going to carry a gun
and then you're going to
lock a kid up for doing the thing that
they've been told to
do when they don't feel safe.
There's a, there's a
disconnect there.
Um
What's true about
many, many of the kids that
end up in the deep end of the juvenile
justice system is that they've experienced
significant traumas in
their life and
what I would have wanted to talk about, had we
gotten into the slides
is
addressing
the issues of juvenile justice
are often really about two things.
It's not so much about kind of the law and
order punishment aspect.
It's about identifying what the
underlying need is for
a child and meeting that need
and it's about having that child
understand the harm that they
caused and having
them repair the harm that they
caused. And you kind
of have to do both and you
kind of have to do both in that order
because if the needs
aren't met, it's hard for them to understand
the harm that they caused, especially if they
have a really serious need around
trauma, around mental health,
which a lot of these young folks
do. Um
And that's where I think the
magic happened in the New Hampshire
model of really inserting
a trauma infused
behavioral health care system
into the juvenile justice system worked,
right? Was that we really were focusing
on those issues first
and then thinking about the second
part, the restorative justice
through the aspect
of it, of identifying who did you
harm and how do you repair the harm
that you caused. Um,
and there are models around the country that
folks are using,
um, to really
kind of work on
kind of the weapons issue with young
people and other ways to think about how
they can feel safe. But that
is really the, the challenge that
we're facing around this,
this guns issue with
kids, I think. And it's, it's
tough and it is a scary
problem that we've,
we've put ourselves
in.
>> Thank you. Thank you very much,
Representative Chavez Representative
Jones, followed by Representative
Ferrari. >> Thank
you Mr Chair and thank
you Mr Ribon for being
here. Your
presentation gives us some
hope that there's been success
in a lot of these areas that we're struggling
in, especially it
was appreciative of what
you said about the workforce
retention. Talked
about physical safety,
psychological safety.
Do you feel like in,
in your experience with departments
that, that you
achieved some
psychological safety?
And, and how was that done?
Was there like a mission
statement that went
across the department? It
was implemented? Can you say more
about that,
please?
>> Yes. Yeah, there's lots of different
ways that you have to go about it. You have
to, you have to approach
it from a lot of different
facets. We worked with the group
out of University of Kentucky on
that.
Um
part of it is in how
you a a key driver
for how staff
um
look at psychological
safety, how does the agency
respond to high
crisis situations? Right.
So looking at how
does, how does the
agency
review its
own critical incidents?
And does it just review them
from a, you know, staff
did this wrong that wrong and the other thing
wrong or do they really take a systemic
view and do they share their
learnings with the
agency from that systemic
lens that helps
staff see that you're not just
blaming people, but
you're taking a critical view
of the agency
and of the system as a whole.
That's one of the things that helps
elevate staff and make them feel
that they,
that there are things that they
see within the system
are valued learnings
and not things that are going to be punished,
right? So that's one step of
it. But there's other critical
steps like you talked about in terms
of just messaging
that we want to hear these things from
staff leadership being
open to hearing things
from staff,
encouraging those types
of things when staff speak
up and say things
that might
might be unpopular,
not having a
culture that punishes that, but that
actually rewards that and encourages
that. And that is a delicate
balance because there are times that
are, that are
appropriate for that and there are moments
that are not appropriate for that, right? You
can't be disruptive, you have to be productive,
right? So there are, there are
balances to that. You can't have chaos
within your organization, but you do have
to create structures and times and
places for open
communication. Um
And that's not often
how government structures
and bureaucracies operate,
right? So you have to
think about how do you
create those structures within your
organization to
and you have to be deliberate about it and
tell people you want it and then
when they do it, you have
to actually reward
it.
>> Thank you very much. Thank you,
Mr >> Chair,
Representative Ferrari.
Thank >> you Mr Chair
and thank you also
for this great
presentation.
I'm glad you mentioned at the
beginning that Annie
E Casey
Foundation
considers, you
know, the child up to age
25.
and I've worked for
underage drinking prevention
for a number of years
and um
having, you know, the
development of the brain be
affected, you know, by
any
um substance use
um is critical.
And when you were talking
about the prevention
models and child welfare
that included substance
use disorder treatment,
um I assume that was
for, you know, um
Children also, but there are
things we can do
um
for
with evidence based
programs and services
to
prevent and have an
environment in our state
that um
would help prevent
underage drinking.
And the later they start until
like they're 25
is better the best.
Um But I was wondering
in New Hampshire and New Jersey,
how is their environment
or do they have programs
for underage
drinking prevention that
helps,
you know, um
to
have better
results with child
welfare.
>> You know, I think it's an area that they
certainly could do better.
I think New Hampshire is actually a state that
probably doesn't do as well in that space
as as they could and probably has some
of the, the poor outcomes
in that space. Um
But I think you're right. I think those
are all areas that,
that fit within this framework
of, of the idea
of a prevention and trying to
keep kids and families,
you know, healthy and strong
and, you know, it
all falls within that same big
bucket. I wish I did have
an answer for you though.
>> Thank
>> you
one quick question for
you. Um uh Joe
and, and thank you, first of all for
the presentation,
incredible stuff.
Um And then a comment
one, the question
is, did either New Hampshire
or New Jersey when
they converted
a lot of their uh residential
programming to Medicaid
and expanded the behavioral
health component and paid
for a lot of things through Medicaid
they hadn't paid for
before. Did,
were they able later to
show savings
in Medicaid expenditures
for having done that? Uh
We, we,
we've been hesitant in the
state to convert things to
Medicaid when I think
in the long run,
they would wind up saving us
Medicaid dollars. But
>> yeah, it, so
there's different ways
like for example, one of the things that
we did in New Jersey in the later
years was we moved a
lot of the residential programming
to what's called APR TF
psychiatric residential treatment
facility model,
which moved what used
to be a lot of state dollars
to a Medicaid
platform,
um which then allowed federal
dollars to supplant, what
was state dollars essentially?
Right. And so it drew
do it reduced the total state
expenditure on residential care
that used to be,
um, you know, and replace
that with federal? Right. So at
the end of the day, that's what
the state of New Jersey was interested in,
was reducing the number of state dollars
that were going out.
>> But, but just even in Medicaid
expenditures, because you probably were
spending Medicaid money on
emergency rooms and,
and hospitalizations.
And was there
any savings in, in regard to
that as well? >> And
I think what's, yes,
I mean, certainly. Right. The cost
of a residential stay is a
lot more than the cost of
in-home treatment for kids.
Right. The in-home services
cost a lot less than the residential
care by far. Um, I
think where more study
could be really
useful that hasn't been done
yet that I'd like to see and then
hopefully, um, we'll
find some folks to help sponsor. The
research is other
phenomena that we saw was,
you know, decreased use
of, uh,
residential care
for special education placements
and within the intellectual developmental
disability system and
decreased use of
even young adult
incarceration, which wasn't part of
our system, but I'm sure
was because those
young adults were having their needs met
through the Children
system of care for behavioral
health. Right. Those
things, there was never really a
good return on
investment done, but
I'm sure that it's not coincidence,
right. So I think there's
probably lots
of benefits that hadn't been
well recorded that
that are, that are due for some
good research beyond
just the direct
connection between the
residential verse
in home service costs.
>> Thank you. Uh And then my
comment, my main
takeaway from your presentation
is that
perhaps we've been
focusing on
changing
the leadership and
changing the managerial
setup of the department
in an effort at improving
its performance. When we, we
really should have been focusing
on
is
re rethinking the
system, rethinking
how we've made
Cyfd
into a
first response
instead of into a last
response and then beefing
up the community-based
services that could have
prevented CYFD
from ever having to get involved
with these families. We would have been much
wiser to do that. We
may still be able to turn it around,
but we sure su we've
sure caused a lot of grief in the
meantime. Thank you
so much for your presentation.
Great stuff and
members. I apologize. We're running
pretty far behind schedule,
but it's important that we
cover this. So Kristina,
we're, we're ready for you now.
Uh uh
Christina
Udvardy, president and Chief
Executive Officer
of All Faith Advocacy
Center, talking about
advocating for and providing
services to
Children and families and welcome.
Good to see
you.
Yeah,
>> I guess this is
working, right? Hi. Hi,
everyone. It's working,
right. Yeah, cool.
Very nice. Very nice to
see all of you. And thank
you for the invitation and I very much
appreciate that I get to come in
after Joe's
presentation.
As
how about, how about now?
It's better, it's
better. Thank
you. Um
I very much appreciate uh being
invited to this committee to speak
in front of the committee and also uh
appreciate that placement
of my presentation so that I can
follow Joe's
perspective from
how uh uh a
statewide um
child welfare agency looks
and what kind of services they provide
and how that then looks
at the provider level.
So I'm representing all a
Children's Advocacy center.
It is a nonprofit
organization that was founded in
1956. So almost
70 years ago here in
Albuquerque and
many of, you know, the
agency probably as office
receiving home back in the day when
it was a shelter
for Children.
Since then, times have
changed and services have changed.
So office today
is an outpatient behavioral
health provider. We
provide services and
my first I I
sent in a few, I'm sorry, I didn't
bring any handouts. We,
>> we
have
>> a, so,
so I understand from Andrea
that you have access to them later,
sort of as a reference, but I'm gonna talk
a little bit about what the agency
does and then also
what's coming into the behavioral
health field and how the
how it's going to transform
behavioral health provision here in New
Mexico and also specifically for
off. So
um of provides
outpatient behavioral
health services for Children
from a very young age
on all the way to
their early twenties.
And as we have
found, and you heard
this from Joe as well and you know
it because you live it in, in this
community, Children are
not best served
by on their own,
right? So we pull as many
families
appropriately into
the services as possible,
right? Because when a child comes
to us who has been highly
traumatized, highly
traumatized through abuse or
neglect, chances
are that it's not some
sort of a fluke incident,
but there is some sort of a chaos
going on in their family,
in their background. So the
more we can pull the family
in, the more we can we
can work with the caretakers,
the more we can understand
what other supports the family
needs in order to take care of
that child. So
along those lines, we structured
our services to
make sure that the kids
who come to us then
leave with uh some
sort of a um
a way to manage their
trauma and a way to
understand uh how,
what the triggers are and how they, how
to move forward. Now,
we also structure the services
so that we connect parents
caretakers to services
of our own and others
in the community.
The majority of the
clients who we see come
through our children's safe
house, a very misleading
name for an agency that does not
have kids living at our
on our premises.
But essentially the safe house stands
for a program that's called, that's a
forensic interview program.
So just to explain to you
what happens there, we
are um one of
nine agencies here in New Mexico
that provides this service.
And uh we
uh we
collaborate with
other investigative bodies
in our community. So we are,
we run the largest child
advocacy center, I mean, uh
forensic interview program
here in New Mexico
just by our
history in the community and also
by our
proximity to the
largest
area of the
largest metropoli metropolitan
area in the state.
We see before the
pandemic, the last four
year before the pandemic, we saw
1700 interviews.
So these are Children who either law
enforcement or CYFD
bring to our doorsteps
because they are
alleged victims or witnesses
to child abuse, sexual
abuse, criminal
activities there is a
criminal investigation already
attached to that child
in some way or shape or form.
So, if you see something
horrible in the community
that happened to a child, you
wouldn't bring that child to us, you
would report that to Cyfd.
Right. And if there is
some sort of a, um,
a fear of
abuse or sexual
abuse or violent
crimes, that's when the child ends
up with us. So you can imagine that the
Children who come through our doors
are already very
highly traumatized, right?
Some of them are as young as
two years old
and barely speaking.
But our job at the
agency is to
bring them into a room
where a trained forensic
interviewer interviews them,
asks age appropriate
questions so that
the child can disclose what
happened to them. Right?
There is a camera in the room
that records the voice
of the child and records
the, the whole
interview on
a video which recording
that goes away with the police.
That is the, the representative
of the police department that's uh
assigned to the case.
So that's our job at office
Children's Advocacy Center,
right? So you can see that
by the time we get involved
many times, it's already
some something, something tragic
already happened, right?
So again, we saw 1700
of such interviews before
the last four year, uh
before the pandemic in
2019
these days, uh we
see about 1000 a
year and not because we
couldn't see 1700 but
probably because there are not
enough reports that make it
to that
point where the child
would come to us. So
after this interview happens, this
is a one time thing, right?
Uh The door opens
really for this child to
go on with therapy
services, with case
management services
and also with wraparound
services. And I understand now,
I don't have to go into what wraparound
means because Joe just explained
that to your committee.
But there is a lot of follow up that
needs to happen in order to
bring their child,
um pass
their trauma if that's
possible or help
them work with their trauma.
Very often we start
pulling families
into uh the care
we work with parents as I
said, and we send them
either to other agencies if that's
appropriate or we see
them through our parenting classes
or our adult therapy
services.
This program,
the, the Children's Safe
House forensic interview program
is entirely
vocal. So CV
RC and CIFD
funded, there is about
a $250,000
funding that comes from the
city and
everything else
is begging,
borrowing and stealing.
So what I wanted to bring to
this to this body here
today is uh that
the nine of us who constitute
a chapter, the chapter of
Safehouses here in New Mexico
are constantly, every
year, are begging the
legislature for more money
and we are begging, begging
for more money so that we can see
the number of clients who come to
us, right? And
um so I want to highlight
how important it
is that we are
able to run these services
that we are this door
that opens for the, for the
Children who otherwise would
have no hope, who
otherwise would have to
repeat their story
to every single
person throughout the
investigation process,
right? Uh But
because of this uh of the
Children Safe House, they are
able to get this recorded
and that minimize the
number of repeats
that they have to do. So, they
can really not relive
the trauma, but go on with
their healing.
So I think it's
easy to see how important
it is that the
CIFD funding stays
in place and every
funding that we can get to the
legislature stays in place
in order for us to run these services,
whether I'm talking about of a
children's advocacy center here in
Albuquerque or
any other forensic
program across the
state
after the child
um leaves
the forensic program and goes to
therapy. There are different
avenues, right? On how they are
going to um how
they are going to um
engage in services with
us. All the
services that we provide
are community based, right? So
it's very important that we have staff
members who go to where the kid
is, who go to their homes,
who go to their school and
help them uh integrate
in that community uh
where they are. And
that is wrap around. And
that is uh
what we call CCS S
Comprehensive Community Support
Services.
Another program that we run
and we started uh
about um
56 years ago
is an adoption program.
So another agency used
to do that here in the community and when they
closed their doors, we took
over their
contract and we took
over uh
their connections with
Cyfd. So,
Cyfd is the one is the
entity here in the, in the
state who contracts
with agencies and
essentially delegates
the home study process to
these agencies, right?
So uh office has a
unique contract with
CYFD
where we are.
Uh we are
um finding the
family connecting with the families
who want to become either foster
parents or adoptive parents
across the state of New
Mexico. And we
meet with them in order to complete
what is called a home
study process. This could
be multiple meetings, right?
And we are not the ones office
is not the one that decides
whether this family is
going to become an adoptive
family or foster family. That's
CYF D's job. We
are doing the paperwork, we are meeting
with the families and that
is a trained
licensed profession who
does that. So it's a counselor,
a social worker, a therapist,
right, who meets with the
family to
fill out the paperwork if they are
so decide to become
foster families or
adoptive families.
Again, this is a CV
FD contract that we have
and my understanding is
that this contract is
going to be cut by
about 20%
this coming year.
So uh that's what we
are hearing through the grapevine with the,
with the uh with
the members of CV FD we are
working with. So I wanted to highlight
again as we are
talking about Children sleeping
on the on the floors of CIFD
offices or being in
other inadequate
placements, how
important it is
that we find
families and we
put them through the process that's
appropriate
necessary
and uh
so that they can then
become the resource
families for these Children
so that we don't have in
this state Children
sleeping on the floors
of CYFD
offices.
So if you're, if if
you could pay attention to
that part in the budget
to make sure that this is
a service that is actually
funded, supported
because we need more families
rather than fewer
families.
So, uh, another program
that, uh, that we do besides
the home study program is an adoption
is the adoption program itself.
We have, uh,
have,
uh completed some adoptions over
the last, um,
fiveish years or
so since we started.
And we also have completed some
placements. Place the difference
between a placement and, and
adoption. Adoption
is whether the
adoption is final, right? If
it's just a placement and a the option
is legally not final, we just call
it a placement. Once it's
legally final, we call it an
adoption. And so we are
one of uh one of three
agencies here in New Mexico who do this
work. We are one, we are the only
agency in New Mexico who
works with LGBT Q plus
families and single
parent families. So
it's a very important distinction,
right? That we welcome
everybody to
um to this process
and we work with everybody who wants
to be become a parent
and we know that there is certainly
no shortage of Children who need
safety and who
need a good
supportive home.
I'm gonna stop here for a second. There
was a lot of words and I want to make
sure that I want to make
sure that you have a chance to ask
questions
or.
Ok,
so, um
so, um just
about two days ago, I think, or maybe
even yesterday morning, uh there
was a press
release from
um
the Behavioral health support division
uh announcing that New Mexico
won the CCBHC
grant. And I want to
introduce CCBHC as a
alphabet soup to this committee.
And also talk about what kind of a
difference that's going to make in
provision of behavioral health and
how that's going to look
at an agency level
where really rubber meets the road.
So CCBHC stands for
Certified Community Behavioral
Health Center and
it's the federal government's best
idea of how to
bring medical care and,
and behavioral health care
together. So it's not
disjointed this
CCB
HC
Certified
Community Behavioral
Health Center.
So this started about 10 plus
years ago under the Obama administration
and was supported through the Trump
administration and then still supported
uh under the Biden
administration. Uh
the idea was
that it's so disjointed
how we get care and people
who receive Medicaid
services and have Medicaid as
insurance. Sometimes
the left hand doesn't know what the right hand
is doing. It costs a
lot of money, right?
And uh Mr
Chair, you asked the question about Medi
Medicaid savings, right?
Cost a lot of money, but it's also
very bad out comes for
the clients, right? So
the I think there was a New Yorker
article on this long time ago
that talked about this woman who
had diabetes and her
doctor filled her prescription
yet she still ended up four
or five times a month in the
emergency room. And they
try to figure out the connection
why that is, it turned out
that she has severe depression
and she doesn't leave her home
so that she needs case management
in order to actually go down to the
pharmacy and access
her insulin in order
to get better. Right.
But these were totally
disconnected issues, right.
So in order to connect these
two dots, the federal
government uh came up with
this idea of the CCBHC
model and they started to
roll it out in two different
ways.
Today, there are about
15 states who have this
model and run this model.
New York is the most
far ahead. And we
just got a federal grant
from Samsa to start
implementing this model here in
New Mexico. We, it was just
announced yesterday or the day
before. So,
uh so the federal government
gives out two pockets of
money, two kinds of
grants, one goes to
states like what New Mexico
got two days ago,
got announced two days ago
and one and the other
kind of grant goes to
individual agencies.
So of is a lucky
recipient. We were one of
63 agencies
last year in the whole country
that we got this grant from Sam
MSA. And what it
requires essentially to do
is that there is no longer
such a thing under
CCBHC as a child
agency or an adult
agency. It's behavioral
health with some medical
component to it.
So it's a, it's
actually um a breath
of fresh air to think in those
terms, that we will have to
build services where we
are not just serving
Children uh from
those limited uh
ages uh
but also
clients across the
lifespan. So
this will require of individual
agencies to build adult
services, to build substance
use disorder services,
to build uh some
medical component that
that is makes
us able to communicate with the
medical provider
and to have a mobile
crisis response
team.
So this is
coming to New Mexico and
this is
now in federal statute.
So this model is not the
next shiny
object, this is here to stay
and it's going to
really transform behavioral
health and medical
health for the Medicaid
population
in across the
country. >> Now,
I understand you to say that
you got a grant, but the
state also got a
grant that will
be
CC
BCS in other
communities, >> correct?
So I understand that the,
that the governor's the
governor's vision was to have
AC CBHC clinic or
agency in every county.
Now, how that will work?
I don't know, we are starting with six
agencies UN
M and office are the
two agencies here in in
the metro area.
And then there are some other
agencies all across
the state who are covering
other parts of the state.
So uh the state is going
to start building out this model with
six of us, but we
have our own grant.
So we have started the
transformation last
October.
>> Well,
>> so um because
this is in statue and because this
is paid differently
than Medicaid services were
traditionally paid.
This is actually a
cost reimbursement
model. Uh
CCBHC is
so before or
traditionally
agencies like office. When we
see a client,
we build their insurance
just like when you go to your doctor
and he or she bills
your insurance for the services
that, that, that he or she
provided to you. Well,
on average, a behavioral
health um
uh service
uh an hour
long, 50 minute long behavioral health
service, whether it's case management or,
or therapy is about
$100
that we get paid
by the managed care
organizations as a
reimbursement. Well, we
had to do a cost study and it turns out
it cost us $350
to provide the same service,
which means that all these
nonprofits are then
uh required to do
fundraising grant writing
and again, still
borrow and just
look for money wherever they can
in order to provide the services
that are essential
to our communities. Right?
It's not of its
mission to,
to uh just
not just off its mission to
help the Children who come to
us, it's all of our responsibility
right to create a better
world for the Children
who uh in our
communities. So
with this cost reimbursement
model means that we
can actually hire
uh at a higher,
at a higher rate, we hire therapists
at a higher rate. We can,
we can have innovation
built in into this
model. So we have
to um provide
nine minimum of nine
services. That's a requirement
by uh the Sam A
grant. But that's just
the bottom line. And we can
actually,
we can actually uh
provide whatever
services we would like to
that we see is going to be
helpful to the specific
community that we are operating
in. So it's a very
innovative model and it
really allows states
to take
into account whether
they are more rural or
more urban, what
kind of minorities
live in the state, whether
there are large areas
that uh nobody lives
in where there are very few
providers or
uh or whether there are
different language and cultural
differences um among
uh the citizens
of that state.
So I'm gonna stop here again
and just see this because this is probably,
it sounds like this is new to the
committee.
>> I would do you have other
information you want to share with us or
should we turn it over for questions?
Now, >> I think we can turn it
over to questions and then
Yeah, and then we will be in
time. >> Yeah, you
don't have to catch us up because
we, we can shove back and
we can even have a working lunch if it
comes to that. So
if you have other things you
wanted to share Christina,
I think I'm good. Ok. Well,
then let's go to the committee for
Questions
and
Representative Jones.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank
you for your presentation. Do
you have any idea how this will
be, this
CCBHC will be
implemented in rural
areas or
where I could find out how to
do >> that? So I, I think
your best, your best
uh um
resource will be the Sams A website,
right? And even if you just Google
it, there's a lot of information that's coming
out, but the implementation
goes through agencies.
So it's not, the state
is not going to stand up different
kind of uh programs
themselves, right? It's
gonna go through agencies. So this
is why it's important that there are six
agencies in this first round
who are going to implement these
services and implement this
model and then it's
just gonna, it's just gonna spread from
there.
So you said
Samsa? Yes. S
A MH S A.
So that's the substance,
substance abuse
and Mental Health administration of
the federal government?
Thank you. Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank >> you.
But who at the state level,
who got the grant? Was
it the Behavioral Health
Division?
>> It's not, it's not
it's not HSD
anymore. It's the right.
It's, it's
>> a, but it's still the
Behavioral
Health
division division. I
guess that
that's so Nick BUCA.
Really? Ok.
All right. So he's the one
we should start sending.
Our,
we should invite to a
meeting with us to tell us
how it's going to impact
services. Great.
Thank you for that.
Representative
Chavez followed by Representative
Ferrari. >> Thank you, Mr
Chair.
Um, I have a question
about a couple of
pieces that you talked about.
Um, you said that all face
is one of the contractors with
CYFD that does foster
parent and
adoptive parent,
home studies.
Um And so my question
is, do you
recruit the foster parents
and the adoptive parents? And
then once the study is
done, do
you only send
the studies that have been
approved to CYFD
or do you send all
of the studies and then they decide
whether or not to, you know,
say there's a family that you don't think
is appropriate. Um
Do they make the decision
to accept them or
return your decision? How does that
work? >> Thank
you for that question and thank you for
asking me to clarify. So
office is the only
agency in New Mexico who
is contracted for, for home
studies. So we are the only
ones and we have staff all over the
state to complete
home studies, not just here in the
metro area, but
uh all over the state, we
complete the home studies. It takes
us sometimes 2345
meetings with the family to
go through that really thick
package. And
then we submit that
with our recommendation to
CYFD, but we do not
make the final decision whether
that family gets approved for
fostering or adopting.
And I hope that clarifies
it.
>> It does. And do you
recruit the foster parents or the
adoptive parents who does that? >> Thank
you. Thank you for reminding me of
that. Uh We actually
have a program that's also CIFD
funded. And I'm hearing that
that might be also uh
subject to some
fund cuts
in funding where we
have
uh events where
we are educating
people inviting people in
different communities across the
state to come, to come
to us, to meet
with us to, to
uh so we can explain what it
entails to become a foster family
or an adoptive family.
So we do that as well.
But I understand that CYFD has
also some outreach into the
community
>> and I guess I must still have a
little bit of time. Do you
have an idea of how many
kids are awaiting
adoption in New
Mexico?
>> I, I don't actually know, but I
can get back to you. I do know
how many adoptions and placements
we have done and it's not a huge
number, right?
Um I uh I
also have to say that very
recently we started discussions with
the Secretary of CIFD
about collaboration around the
baby boxes, right?
When, when, when parents surrender
their Children, but I don't
know how many there are who are actually
waiting.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. >> How
many did you do?
>> Uh let me see. We
did about in the last
4, 3.5 years,
we did about
20 placements. So where the
adoption is not final yet
and 13
adoptions?
>> Ok.
Mm
Representative Ferrari followed
by Representative Vincent. >> Thank
you Mr Chair and
thank you, I
was
very interested
in your safe house
and the forensic
interviews and
how much funding
um you need
to be able
to accomplish
all of those.
>> So thank you so much for that
question. I appreciate it.
Uh We run over
a million dollar budget for just a
forensic program, right?
But again, it's because we see so
many Children and we have so many more
staff, but I'm gonna get you
the aggregate number that
all the safe houses
across the state
need because
it's not just about office, right?
This program is
unified and across
the board and we are all
accredited by the National Children's
Alliance. So we all do the same
high level, very
sophisticated professional work
and I'm going to get you the number and I appreciate
the question. >> Ok,
great. Um I
also, I should
probably know this but I know there
have been many attempts to make
it so that
with the videos,
the
Children don't have to repeat
their testimony or
their story. But
do they
still have to go to
court? We haven't
been able to change that.
Let >> me, yeah, so,
so thank you for that question
too. Really?
Truly, that Children have
to repeat their story. It's not one
time and zero after,
right? They do have
to, they do have to repeat
it and we are actually putting
together legislation and we have tried
it for the last I think
two years to pass it through
where we take out one of the
testimony which is in front
of the potentially
the perpetrator in
court. Uh So
that's gonna come, we, we're gonna put
that back in all the safe houses
together at this coming session.
Uh But it's not, it's not
one time. That's, you're right.
It's a, it's a, it's a few
times and right now we're still
working on getting those,
get that number
down.
>> Thank you. I'm sorry, that
hasn't passed yet. But I
hope everyone in this
committee would support that
because it is
very
um critical situation
to put a child through.
And, um, I think if we
can reduce
that by one
time, you know, that they
have to do that, especially
before the offender
are, are
perpetrator that
would be very helpful
to not have the child
traumatized even further.
So, thank you very much.
Thank
you,
>> Representative
Representative Vincent, followed
by Senator Rodriguez.
>> Thank you Mr Chair.
My question is
if someone wants to
adopt a
child
after they go through the
process, if they do
everything just right and
everything is made in a, in
a perfect
way. How
long would that take
Mr Chair?
>> Thank you for that question. Well, it
depends. Right. That's
not a good answer. Uh
We just recently
adopted out, um
helped with an adoption of
a little boy who
was surrounded in one of those
baby boxes
and uh essentially
the mother uh
chose a
single mom who
has been waiting with us for
3.5 years.
So she has been, she has done the
whole process. She went through the home
study process. She was waiting
and waiting and waiting
and she was chosen
3.5 years later. So it
depends.
>> Thank you Mr Chair and thank you for
that answer. And I was just wondering
because I, I have some people
in my district that have
been on that list
and they've gone through the
process?
And do you believe
that the
process
is, can we do
better? Could we, could
we make it faster?
I know people need to be
vetted but
do they lose interest after a
while? Just on the
bureaucracy, paperwork
side of they want a child, but
just the paperwork
side? >> Thank
you. Thank you for asking that. I think
I would say that the paperwork side
is not, is not the cumbersome
part, right? I mean, I think everybody
is interested and very
hopeful when they start the process
and that doesn't take very long.
What then could take long is
that you just sit there and wait for
somebody to choose you if you
want a baby, uh,
to, if you want a baby
to, to adopt a baby,
if you want an older child,
right? There are different, there are
different, you know, ways and
you might not have to wait that
long.
It depends on, on what your preference
is as a parent. Thank you, >> Mr
Chair >> every
Sunday in the, every Sunday in
the paper. There's an article about a kid
who's available for
adoption. They're not an
infant, they're
1114,
17, but
there are a lot of kids that are going
without families that aren't
necessarily infants.
Representative Jones and then
Senator Rodriguez. You had a quick
question. >> Yeah, I have a quick question.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Just
to clarify what you said about the
baby box. Did you
say the mother who,
who left the baby in the baby
box? Chose
a mom? So we've,
we've managed to make
sure that that mom is
anonymous and yet
involved in the choice
of who would adopt her
baby.
>> Thank you for that question.
Um The mom is not
anonymous.
The mom was tracked down
because they track the parents
down through
DNA.
And so that's what the discussion
start, how the discussion started
with CIFD about all of this,
right? They were
very
um very
forthcoming. CIFD was
very forthcoming, very helpful, very
collaborative at the end
so that we could make a good decision.
So and then adopt this baby
out. But yeah, the
parents are not anonymous. I think,
I think the women who are,
who think about leaving their
baby in those baby boxes think that
they are anonymous, but
they can be tracked down through
DNA.
>> Thank you.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
So can we, I
mean, we can assume that that is
going to happen. A baby who's left
in a baby box will have
DNA testing and the
mother will be found is
that the case >> that
>> can >> happen, >> can
happen or?
>> Well, I think it depends on,
I don't know what kind of a database they
access for DNA,
right? So I don't know what CD does
there and, and what
kind of a system you have to show up in
order to, to be
connected to that child.
>> A lot of questions surrounding
that. Yeah. Thank you
for that answer. Thank you, Mr
Chair, >> Senator
Rodriguez. Thank >> you, Mr
Chairman. Good
morning. Thank you for your
work in your, in your
presentation. Just
quickly,
I had a question but
now that representative
Jones asked something triggered
here in my mind. But
so what if you look for the
mother or you identify the
mother? What do you do with,
with that through DNA? As
you mentioned, what happens then
with the mother? Thanks. >> Thank
you for asking that. I, I, we
do not look for the mother.
That's not, we don't do that right?
We only got involved once,
once C ID notified us that
there is a little boy
uh who uh
is uh given
up for adoption. So
our agency does not get
mixed into that. We don't
have the bandwidth the,
the legal
uh the legal standing or anything
to do that. Ok. >> So do
you know who does if
Cyfd or someone else does
what they do at that point with
the mom? >> I do not
know. I do not know, but that would be a
question for. Yes,
>> thank you. We would see that.
And then my question earlier was
quickly Mr Chairman,
you spoke about Children
like being recorded
in messages and so on as to
their um
their experiences and
or abuse.
And the question
I have is what is the age limit?
Because you brought up a two year
old and of course, can
speak and so on.
At what age do you
record a child?
And I
guess, yeah, thank
you, >> Mr Chairman. Thank you.
Thank you for asking that.
So I would love to invite
everybody over to a
so that we can do a tour
and, and if that's too
far for you, it would be
solace in, in Santa
Fe. Uh they do
the same work. So when a
child comes to us, right? And
we ask them to disclose
what happened to them, we walk them
through the premises, right?
And we point out the camera
that it's gonna be recorded because
often they were, they were, they
were sex trafficked, right?
So we don't want them to see the
camera in the middle of the
interview and just freak
out, right? Um
Our staff is trained for
nine months, nine
months before they ever set
foot alone in an interview room,
right? And they are trained
on how to ask age appropriate
and non leading questions.
So it's different how you ask a two
year old who is barely verbal
than a 21 year
old is probably where we sort of
cut it off. But we also
interview developmentally delayed
adults who have
been through some abuse
or, or neglect
and, and, and
they are, uh they are,
they come to us for that interview.
So, um and then
this recording is important,
right? Because it becomes part of the criminal
investigation
process.
Thank you. >> Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr
Chairman.
>> Anybody else? I had
a couple of questions and then a comment
one, I'm
just stunned to hear that
Cyfd is talking
about cutting the
contracts.
Um is
that, have you, you haven't
actually been notified by them
yet? You just heard
this kind of through the
grapevine.
>> So it
is
what is today June 6th, right?
So we are about three
from the start of the
year and
I just yesterday heard
from our staff members
that they heard from AC
five D staff member that there is potential
cuts to these contracts
for the outreach in the community
to potential fo foster
and adopted adoptive families
and also to our home study
contract. And
we have not had anything
confirmed. We have not
had anything in writing
and I have not heard from
the secretary, but that's
sort of what we are preparing a
20% cut to these
contracts, which
is gonna result in
fewer home
studies and fewer
events in
outreach.
>> Well, as it turns out, the
secretary will be here this
afternoon. We think
we're still, we're still assuming
she'll be here. She's
on our agenda.
And so we, we'll, we'll have to
make sure we ask that question
while she's here.
Um Thank
you. I, I'm
struck by by
the presentation
before, you just made a whole big point
about how we've
made a huge mistake by making
Cyfd the
be all and end all of Children
services that
we really should have thought of
them more as a,
as a final resort.
And that we should have been putting our
efforts into things
other than CYFD
that might have kept kids from
ever having come, been
brought to the attention of
Cyfd. And
that's where the community agencies
and the contracts that this department
should have had with
community agencies, not
just for things that would serve
Cyf D's
interest,
not just for things that would
free them up from not
having to do home studies,
they will just be, we'll
farm that out. So we don't have to
do it. We'll
farm out this because we won't have
to. But what's best
for kids out there
to keep them from ever having
to, I mean, it's a whole different way of
thinking about what your contract
responsibilities are,
not just what's going to help
us, but what's going to help
the kids. So,
I, I mean, I, I really,
I mean, hearing
your
potential cut in
service contract
right after hearing a
whole other way of
approaching service
contracts, just
the juxtaposition of those
two bits of testimony
was startling
and I really want to thank you for,
first of all, for the work you're
doing, Kristen and for
all face stepping forward.
Now, my
leading and terrible
question because I
know you've been avoiding this for a
long time. All
face used to run an emergency
shelter.
That was what brought all faith
into existence.
And for 50 years, all
faith was where kids who were
brought on an emergency
basis could be taken
by the social worker instead of
to their
office.
And
25 years
ago, 20
years ago,
2018
years ago, we,
we, we
moved away from a shelter.
We wanted to have family
homes as a much improved
way of placing kids. We
didn't want them to go to this
depersonalized
institution. We wanted them
to go to
warm cuddly
homes
and we've discovered
there aren't very many of those
warm cuddly homes that
are, that can be
found
and instead of
a well run
institutional
shelter where the
kids didn't have to go through
repeated replacements,
it would be so
bad
if they went to all
faiths and then
went
three days later to a
family home.
I mean, that's one
that's two dislocations from
their family and from all
what they do now is
to the office
and maybe to another office
and then they find a home for
a few days and then to another, I
mean, we've,
we've substituted
a problem with a much
bigger problem.
What are the chances of
all faith
ever
resuming your
initial
mission?
>> That was
a, that was very well done.
Thank you, Senator.
Um, uh, let me say
this. Um I think
that, and you, and you mentioned this,
right, that in 2006, when
the shelter closed, we
moved away from that model and from
that philosophy, because we believed
in placing Children
with, with foster families,
um and in homes and
not in, in
institutions really,
um what happened after
was really, um
remarkably tragic, right?
Because so many kids ended up
out uh out of uh
out of state
and sort of, you know,
jailed up for a letter, but for
lack of a better word
and really, really highly
traumatized and then they, you know,
then the door opens and when they are
18 and they're like pointed into
the direction of New Mexico, they come
back. All we see
is there are able-bodied adults
standing at the side of the road,
but they are
so challenged
mentally behaviorally, right?
So, um I have to say
of sold that property at
and Trellis Drive
in the North Valley. That was
our shelter.
I also, I also don't want to
ever say never, right.
Uh I want to say that
I'm, I'm very hopeful with the
CCBHC model because I
think it's gonna be, it's
gonna allow us to get
into uh sort
of up upstream.
And we talked about that so much,
right? For decades, about how do
we catch this upstream and not
deal with the chaos
and the devastation at the, at
the back end. Um
I think that, that
gives us a better, that
gives us a better chance of working
with families so that
we are really supporting
the need where
it arises rather
than when it's already too
late. And I also think
that it is, it is a complex
question, right? This is not going
to be resolved by um
CIFD by a
new governor by it's a
long term. We need to make
this long term investment in our
community and and
who is going to be willing to step up
and say this is not gonna take
an election cycle, this is not gonna
take uh whatever
budget, right? This is
all of us looking at what, what
needs to happen here and there
are so many parts to that
right there is
how we pay jobs, whether
there's health care access,
what kind of housing we have
for, for kids and families,
what kind of schools, schools they
go to, etcetera. So all
that piles up
and it becomes like we want a
quick solution because
that's, you know, that's what we want,
that's how we are. We are
conditioned, that's not gonna
happen, I think, but I do, I'm
very hopeful with CCBHC.
I'm very hopeful to be able to
pull adults in
and Children into a place
where we can provide trauma
informed care and,
and, and really look at the
myriad of issues and
come up with better outcomes,
not just financially, which
is what a lot of what you're looking
at, right. But also outcomes
wise for the families,
the adults and the Children we
serve. So that was
a long answer to.
No.
Well, not now.
>> Yeah,
I would just note two
things. One over
Christmas last year,
the kids were
because the offices weren't gonna
be uh
staffed at all.
The kids were moved
to the youth detention
center.
We jailed them, the
youth jail.
This
is, you know, mind-blowing,
we remove them from their families,
keep them in an office for a few days
and then move them to a jail.
Under.
What
strange
economy does this make
sense? Anyhow,
the other thing is, I would
also note that San
Diego
recently, I think within the
last 10 years
through a grant from the Kroc
Foundation, uh
mcdonald's money
built a wonderful
overnight shelter,
fully staffed 24 hours
available. And it's,
it's, it's where
the police and social workers
take kids who need to
be housed on an emergency basis
and from there, then the child welfare
agency finds a foster home
if they can
Anyhow,
thank you.
Things that work elsewhere. Never
work in New Mexico. I'm
told
Senator Stefani, you had a
question,
>> Mr Chair. It's just a comment
on your comment.
I did send it to
and I will send it out to
everybody. There was,
there's a two
page
synopsis of the
original CYFD
Charter and all of
its responsibilities
and your comment about
is it really
delegated too many
responsibilities? Is
exactly the point.
It's, it's
intense,
it's
top-heavy.
So I
believe that that's something to look
at administratively. Thank
you.
>> Well, thank you
very much Christina for,
for your, for your presentation, but
for the work you're doing
and
for
making sure that this community's
response is well
thought out
and
ideally well
financed and thank you for going
out and getting that grant to help do that
as well.
Congratulations on that. >> Thank
you. Thank you so much for having me.
And if you have any questions, I will
definitely follow up on
yours, Representative
Ferrari and thank you for having
me. Thank you for
spending three days on
children's issues. Great.
>> Thank you? Ok.
Next members, we have a
presentation on the Children's
Trust Fund
by two members of the board of
trustees of that fund.
Um Kim
Strauss and
the vice chairman Marg
Elliston.
>> And,
and I did bring copies
of, of our
presentations or
anything.
Ok.
The children's trust
fund.
Right.
>> Mm.
Good morning
members of the committee.
Senator.
I don't know what I'm doing. >> Just,
just turn the mic to
you. That's
right.
>> Yeah, I try not to be a Luddite
but sometimes it
exposes.
So thank you for having
us today. I, I'm
here uh sort of as a
lastminute back up for
uh Kim Strauss who's a
very active
member of our children's
trust fund board. And,
but I wanted to start off
with thanking you for
listening to us through these
years and for uh
helping us get some
appropriations, the
drops in the bucket. But
we are very appreciative.
And last year we
uh um
started out with working
with you all asking for $10
million from the legis from
the budget process
to increase our endowment.
We ended up with 800,000.
So we, we're making
progress. It's very slow. But
so that's why we're here again.
And one of the reasons we're here
again and, and thank you for inviting
us. Um
we,
when Kim was putting
together a presentation
today, I said, wow, we've
really done a lot last
year. So we worked
closely with uh
staff at CYFD
at many levels
to push forward
our, uh
what our volunteer board
would like to see happen and we
have a hard-working volunteer
board, but we are
volunteers.
Um So
I'm gonna turn it over to Kim.
I, uh but I wanted to
just put a personal note
in as I was listening to some
of the discussion and
testimony and I've been
around as long as our
chair here. Uh
He's been around a little bit
longer than me. Uh, but
we've seen the cycles of
service programs coming
up and
getting shut down and
continuing. And I was
really interested to look at
the, uh, Annie
Casey presentation of
when, uh,
exemplary systems
started planning and
developing themselves.
And it's like, looks like
it's a 30 year span to
bring something to,
to, uh,
something that works. So I'm
hoping that we can
make a commitment for a
30 year span. I probably
won't be here for the end of
that, but I, it looks
like that's what we need to do and we
should really think about that.
So, uh, with that, I'm
gonna turn it over to Kim who's
got the vision for
starting that 30
year
span.
>> Uh, Mr Chair,
uh, and, uh,
madam vice chair. Thank
you for this opportunity. Members
of the committee. My
name is Kim Strauss and I've
been on the board,
uh,
this time,
uh, for
six years I think.
And, uh, I
served previously
on the children's trust fund
board during the
Richardson and Martinez
administration.
Um
I'm not gonna go, I
think you have our
presentation. I'm
not gonna go through all of it,
but I hope
for those of you who don't know
us that we've been around for a
while. Um,
we are the, the folks
who have the
kid license plate.
Um,
and we've
been promoting that quite a
bit, um,
in the last
uh,
year or 21
of the things that was very exciting
for us is that we formed
a partnership with the
uh New Mexico Automobile
Dealers Association.
Uh And through their
executive director, Mr
Ortiz, we were able
to send
out our
um our
posters
that we've been working
on
um
to 100
and nine auto
dealers around the
state uh along
with our cards
um that
can be given
to uh customers
at dealerships. Uh
If any of you would like a
set of cards to leave
off with your mechanic
or other
uh place where you
get uh auto
service uh to
promote getting our
license plate. Uh We'd
love to pass
them along to you.
Um
uh a couple of,
of other
highlights. Um
We have recently
become a uh
a provisional
chapter and we
will get permanent chapter
status uh after
a preliminary
time um
of prevent child abuse
America.
Um The
children's trust fund was
the chapter in New Mexico
for uh prevent
child abuse America.
Years ago.
Passed it along to UN
M and New Mexico
State. Uh and
unfortunately,
um uh
the activity
died. Um
And we felt it
important enough
uh to
uh resurrect that. And
we've now joined
uh as a chapter
that gives us
a lot of national
uh information and
resources. One of the most
important things that, that
I found and uh when
I, when we were a chapter
before is that
they do a lot of work around
messaging about
how you, you
speak with
um uh
communities and
families and, and people
about uh
the prevention of child
abuse and neglect. Uh
So, uh I
think we
have a lot to learn. We're going to
share that with
um uh
CYFD and other
agencies.
Uh And
uh they, they do
a national
conference
that uh I'm
hoping to go to and, and I
think others on the
board and members
of the CYFD staff
will go
to. Uh they work
also with the Children's
Trust Alliance, the
National Organization of
Children's Trust and Prevention
Funds,
um which
we've been a member of for
many years. Uh
And uh
so it really brings
together lots of,
of uh
of uh
national voices
and local voices
you heard earlier
in the Casey presentation
about the work in New Hampshire and
New Jersey. And um
I remember learning
a lot from the Children's
Trust Fund of New Hampshire
about the work they
were doing.
Um
We are about
to uh
issue another
request for proposals.
We do one every four
years. So our grants
are fouryear grants
because our mandate
in legislation from
uh the legislature
is to
fund
innovative
community-based
programs.
And so this is an
opportunity for
an organization
to
create,
develop,
implement,
evaluate and
then hopefully, if it's
a, a good program
in that community
to um
sustain it and
figure out the way to
sustain it. So,
um one of the things
that um
we talk about a lot
is that
um even though we
know that, that um
legislators want to
see evidence-based
programs,
um sometimes
you need to have a
pilot that
tries it out and
sees if it works.
Um
And
we think that the children's
trust fund is the, is a
great opportunity
for an
organization to
try something new
and it, it doesn't have to be new
to New Mexico. It can be new
to that community,
new to the
uh people that, that
uh organization
serves.
Uh
And uh
so, uh
one of the things we did
in creating the, the
new uh request
for proposal and, and the board
worked on this for quite a few months
to get it done well
ahead of time
um is
to beef up the,
the data collection
information that we're
asking for
because we know
that if organizations
collect really good
data
and deep data,
if they can
um that, that
will help them
to raise money
for the, the
um
sustainable uh
to sustain the program
to keep it going.
Um And
um it then
it can help
to uh
become
evidence-based uh or
certainly a, a promising
practice.
Uh
So, um
we are um
hoping um
to get more
uh applications.
Um This year when
we issue our request for
proposals from
small organizations, we've
had fairly large
organizations, fairly
sophisticated organizations
who know how to
do this uh grant
process. The state
uh grant process,
uh
proposal process
is fairly complicated.
Um uh
We're, we're
really hoping that we'll
get uh
more applications
from small organizations,
from rural organizations,
from tribal organizations
and, and entities.
Um So
that we can have a, a
diverse group
of uh
grantees
Uh Now,
along those lines,
as Mark
mentioned, we are going
to come back to you
this year and ask
for a one time
appropriation for our
endowments.
Uh your information
that we gave you uh shows
what our endowments are
currently.
And uh we
really believe that
uh a
big one time
infusion would really
help us to
get
the
income that
could boost our
um uh
spendable
fund so that
we can make more
grants and,
um, better
grants. Uh, in
some cases, more
money, uh,
to, uh, really
fund a program that
again allows it to
really be developed
well, um,
staffed, well,
uh, implemented
and evaluated.
Well,
uh,
the other
piece we, we wanna,
uh, bring up
is that,
um, there
was a
legislation,
uh, introduced,
uh, in the last
session, uh,
that concern,
uh, marriage license
fees,
uh, an increase
to marriage license fees
that did not, uh,
pass
through the
legislature.
Um, but,
uh, there was no,
uh, to, there,
there was no provision
in that increase
to increase our
portion of those
fees. We do get a portion
of, uh, marriage
license fees,
uh, into the children's
trust fund.
And, um, there
was no conversation with
us about,
um, increasing
our take,
um, from the
marriage license fees.
Uh, we don't know if the county
clerks will bring that
up, uh, again
in the coming set.
But, um,
we, we have decided
we want to reach out to county
clerks and say that
um you know, we're,
we can't, we can't really say
that we support it. We don't,
that's not
our, our job. But if
there is a um
increase in marriage license
fees, we certainly want to
be included
in an in increase
in our take.
Uh
One of, one of the
issues that
we have is that
um as many
of you may know, we
uh oversee the
next generation
fund, which
is uh those,
those are grants to
support positive
youth development.
The only revenue
stream they have in the
next generation fund is
income from their
uh in small
endowment.
Um
And in the last
couple of years, we've
had to, the children's trust
fund board has had to
give money to
the
um uh
next generation
uh council to
bolster what they're
able to do on an annual
basis. Um
So we really would
like to see at
some point, we of course, would like
to see a revenue
stream dedicated
to the next generation
fund. But in
the meantime, uh
we think that,
for example, uh an
increase in the amount we
get from the
marriage license fees
could help us
um with
uh supporting the next
generation fund.
Um
And with that,
um I, I just
want to add one other
um uh
common if I may.
Um
And, and this is uh
uh to your
uh uh
comments. Uh
Senator Ortiz
Pino, is
that um when
you all uh the
legislature created the
early childhood
education and care
department.
Um That is an
upstream
family. I hope
family-oriented
strategy
to support
families early
in the process of being
families of having
Children. Um
And um
I would hope that
their continued work,
their continued development
and their
uh opportunities
because you have funded
them generously
to raise
awareness about the
joys of being
parents and, and
the, the supports
that are available as
new parents uh
through uh all
kinds of services, including
home visiting and others
that um
we will see
some real changes
in um
how, how Children
thrive in this state.
Uh I think it's a really
great opportunity
uh because you've really
elevated this
notion of early child
development to a much
higher status.
Uh And, and
as I say, you've been
generous with them.
Um We
hear, we don't know if that's
true that they
have more money than they can
spend.
Um
Yeah. Um
and um
and, and we are in
conversation with them. We,
we think there's great opportunities
for uh partnerships
with, with the early
childhood department.
Um And
uh but, but I do
think that that's one of
those uh ways
in which you have said
that um
let's, let's go
upstream and,
and uh
uh start
early.
I agree that that
CYFD should be the last
resort.
So with that, uh
we
uh are grateful for
this opportunity and, and would
be glad to take your
questions.
>> Uh, first up on our
schedule or list
is Senator
Stefanik, followed by
Senator Rodriguez.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and thank
you for your presentations.
Um I'd like to first
give a shout out to Senator Tom
Rutherford. Uh I
assisted him with the children's
license plate and,
um, we shouldn't forget
that, you know,
good people
really brought forward
these uh
projects. The
second uh comment I
have and then the third
question is
a question, the
marriage license fees.
I think
uh the issue
for me would be
not making any
cost prohibitive
for
any segments of our
population by
raising that fee. So
II, I tend to
look at other
ways, but
my third question is
you indicated that the Children
trust fund might be a
space or
spot Mr chair
for pilot
programs. Do you
have the capacity for
oversight if any
pilot programs were established
through you? Thank you, Mr
Chair
>> um Mr Chair,
Senator Stefanik.
Uh Our,
because we are
administered through
CYFD,
um They
provide the
oversight of contracts
and, and uh
grants. They
do um
uh
on site visits,
they get uh
monthly reports
from uh uh
grantees. They
share that with the board
and the board reviews.
Those uh board
members go on site
visits sometimes with
CYFD staff.
Um So
we are, we
are
constantly
monitoring that
and, and we hope
through this RP
process um
that we've developed
that we're going
to get more robust
data, uh
more information
at a on a timely
basis
and be able to then
uh get back
with um
our grantees
about
um uh
how they're collecting
it. Um
What uh
issues they faced
in collecting that
data? Um
And is it
really
uh helping them
in their continuing
development and
work on
that project that they're
funded
for?
>> Ok. Thank you, Mr
Chair,
>> Senator Rodriguez. >> Thank
you, Mr Chairman. Good morning,
Kim and Marge. Good
to see you again.
I was there when you came to
the finance committee. So
what you said resonated with
me broke my heart
because you were asking for 10 million
and my goodness, I was afraid we weren't
even going to be able to do the 800.
But thank you. Um
I just have a quick question on the
grants that you issue
you spoke about today. You have
this criteria. I think Kim,
you mentioned the
criteria that a person
or an organization would
have to meet to
be selected for
future ongoing
funding. And
the question that I have is who
evaluates you mentioned?
One of those is evaluate,
you know, and, and the
performance and so on
who evaluates that is, do
you have like a board or is
that a
tell me? >> So,
so uh to review
proposals, we put
together a group of board
members with
um CYFD
staff
um
uh who,
who are a proposal
review committee
and they will review all
of the um
proposals that are submitted.
CYFD does an
initial evaluation
to be sure that all, all
the
um you
know,
I's are dotted and all
that, all everything
is in because it is
a com the applying
for state grants is a
complex
process.
Um And in fact, I
should mention and, and it's,
it's in your
um uh
report that we
did uh put
together a uh
a training session
at uh UN M
continuing ed
to uh
uh walk people
through the process
of our request
for proposal because
we know it's built
on a
state template.
Um So we think
that anybody
who participated
in that workshop
um would be able to
apply for most
of any of
the um
state grant
opportunities.
Uh so that
we, we then do
that evaluation and, you
know, part of what we're looking at is
to try to have
a group of
grantees in a
uh a cohort
over that four years
that um
it is uh
representative throughout
the state. So we,
we do look at at
some uh diversity
in terms of communities
served and uh
population served
and, and things of that sort.
>> OK. Thank you very
much for that. And I,
I just want to thank you both
personally for just doing
such great work. Um
It's very obvious your heart
is all in
and I just
appreciate you very much. Thank
you also for your perseverance
and your continued
request for funds. Hopefully
this year you'll get more.
Thanks, Mr
Chairman.
>> Anybody else on the committee?
I, I had a couple of questions
of my own. So,
um first,
I, I
mean, I think it's really exciting to
see that
organizations that you've
given grants to
have been able
to then find other sources
of funding to continue.
Uh But I'm, I'm struck
by the, the fact that
CYFD has
funded those things Have,
have they, do you have any,
any past
grant
that you funded
over the past, let's
say just over the last 10
years, that actually
then CYFD, because the whole
point was to try to get Cyfd
to, to,
to
build on the innovations
that you all
finance
to, to then adopt them.
And have you had any examples
of
that
>> um Mr Chair? There,
there are a couple of examples that
come to mind. One is, and,
and I'm not to remember the II
I have the grants
list here.
Um
There's a
program that
promotes uh
father
involvement
um in
Las Cruces.
Um
And
um
uh they,
they started the program
through a, a
children's trust fund grant.
And as far
as I know, I think that program is
still going
on um
in
um Las
Cruces, uh
Representative Ferrari, you
might know
that uh I'd have to,
I'd have to look it up.
Um
And
um
I think that there have been
a couple of
others.
Uh The program we're
currently funding in Lee
County is, is really
built upon a
program
that was
started earlier.
They, they
tried to expand
it. Um
Unfortunately, they've had some
staffing issues
uh in Hobbs.
But uh
that was a program that,
that I believe they
initially got
started through CYFD
and then later
um
uh
worked on, on expanding
it and that was the innovation
part of it um
to different age
groups.
Um >> The
reason I bring it up is because I
think you not in
your uh
report
but also in what you said that you
met with the secretary
uh last month
or a couple of months back about the
possibility of
their providing more staff
support for what you do.
And even an intern, did you
get favorable feedback
from them on that?
>> Um
I, I would say not
yet.
Yes, it is a
work in progress.
Uh We,
we started that, that
uh process
a couple of
secretaries ago
uh trying
to, to get more
dedicated time from
a staff person.
Um
In the old days, we actually
had an administrative
assistant and a, a
program officer.
Um
and the administrative
assistant went around
the state and went to health
fairs and
um to
the uh high
school basketball tournament
in the pit and all of that
to promote uh the
children's trust fund and
did it alongside
uh the
uh foster and adoption
program uh
folks. So
um it was, it
was a good partnership.
We, we would like to
see that kind
of, of
uh thing happen again.
And that's going to be
especially I
think it's gonna be especially
important um as
we um
develop further our membership
with prevent child abuse
America because there's just
so much information
available from them
about
um
working with, with
communities.
Uh uh talking
about how
we, we
effectively do
child abuse and, and
neglect
prevention.
>> Well, I, I
congratulate you on,
on keeping that dialogue going
because that, that I do remember
when they had a full-time staff
person who
was
working to promote the,
the whole concept.
Uh I would love to
see somebody who would also
promote the
department
adopting some of the
things that are demonstrated
through your grants
uh that
complete the loop. That would be
really, really great.
But thank you for this. Uh
Any other questions from anybody
or any comments?
Um
Representative Ferrari,
>> um I'm
double-check, but I'm pretty
sure thefa father's
parenting program is still
going on in Las Cruces
and it's either through
engage or
success partnership,
I believe.
>> Thank
you.
>> Well, that's good to hear.
So, thank you and good luck in
your efforts at getting money
from a state
that's currently carrying
if you added up
$9 billion in the
early childhood trust
fund,
$2 billion in
the Revenue Stabilization
Fund. All of that is
surplus money that's waiting
there that could be tapped
and $3 billion
in operating reserves for this
year 30 we say we have
30% reserves. We actually
have 100 and
45%
reserves and
you should be able to
find
$10 million you
would hope,
but
this would be a priority I
think. Thank you. Thank you for
coming. Thank you,
Representative
Representative >> and thank
you chair. I just, just to add
to that senator
chair. Thank you
very much for your work. You did
yesterday. We had a
presentation from a
pediatrician who made it
very clear that the
education efforts about
shaken baby syndrome
made huge
change, positive
changes in the numbers here in
the state. And so,
yeah, a small investment
for education
on, on the subject matter
could go a long way. So, thank
you >> and, and Mr
Chair
Representative Kate's
children's trust fund
funded
some of the first
education programs
around shaken Baby
years and years
ago.
>> Very good.

>> we go. Um
Good afternoon chairman
and all of the committee. Thank you very
much for giving me this opportunity
to speak. Um There
are a million things that I'd love to share
with you. Um My, my name
is Alison Endicott Quinones
and I am the legal director of
advocacy Inc, we provide
legal services for
Children in the foster care
system um from
age zero through 21.
Um And I've been doing this for
quite a long time as have my
colleagues. So we have a lot of experience
here in Bernalillo County. I
alone have uh worked with
at least I represented some
over 750
Children. Um
And so there have been
many issues that have been brought
up, but there's one issue
that I wanted to raise.
Um, and you know, that
has been touched on
and it's the situation with
um, Children in the office
that we have heard about
and I wanted to give a little
bit more of a
description of what's
happening so that you
all would realize just what a
crisis it is
when it comes down to it.
CYFD and the courts
have shifted the burden
of parenting, the Children
for whom they are tasked
with parent with protecting
under the, the auspices
of giving youth more
autonomy,
their children's brains. We've
heard this time and time again,
children's brains aren't fully
developed, not even
by 21. It's like, I think
I've heard anywhere from 23
to 26 and executive
function, the thing that makes us
make smart
decisions, reason
through
processes.
That is the part of the brain
that's the last to develop.
And unfortunately,
we have in the,
in the guise or
the well intentioned
uh approach of wanting to
give young people,
especially youth 14
and over. Um give
them more, more
autonomy, more
agency in their lives, which in
and of itself is a wonderful
thing to do. We always need to listen
to our young people.
Unfortunately,
we have given more
freedom to these
traumatized Children with
mental health issues
and with increased
impulsivity,
more power to make long
term decisions without
guidance that will affect them
for the rest of their lives than
most Children who are not in
custody. And
the kids in the office situation
is a perfect example.
Right now, we have a lot of
Children who are hard to place. A
lot of that is because of
their, um, of their
mental health issues.
Children, over 14,
because of the mental, the
children's mental health code
are able to refuse all
mental health services,
whether it be counseling
or medications. And
a lot of people don't realize
that, um,
additionally when
they, um, with these
young people they have
the right to reject a placement.
So if you go to
somewhere that has rules that
they don't like or they go to a
home, you know, and, and,
and this is what I'm hearing.
Oh, I don't like their rules. Oh,
they take away my phone.
Oh, you know, we hear a lot
of that.
They actually
choose
often to disrupt
from their placement. Sometimes they
disrupt because they can't, they don't have the
ability to control their behaviors.
They're traumatized kids.
But there's also this
cycle that's formed where they
realize the office
is like lord of the
flies
Children. There
are, most of them have
mental health issues or just were
really hard to place. They
have the right to walk out of the
placement and out
of the office at any
time and
they have the ability
to have their phones
with unfettered
access. We
have kids who are and
through those, the use of that
social media that is not
monitored whatsoever and the
ability to come and go as they
please with nothing
happening in between.
We have kids who are being
groomed for trafficking
kids who are being sex
trafficked kids who are
being sexually assaulted
and having consensual sex
in the office. We
have drug deals going
on in the office as well as
going out and bringing them back
into the office. And this
is coming from my
colleagues who hear it from
their clients. This isn't
just chitter chatter behind this
from an urban
legend. These are things that are
actually happening. I have
a client who is sexually assaulted in
the CYFD office as a young
child. I have
two that have been
actually trafficked
and it was being in the
office that facilitated that
process. They have the
right to refuse school.
They have the right to
like I said that to
elope and, and sometimes
return and law enforcement
has stopped looking for these
kids. And the reason
is because the moment they
pick up the child, they
come back to the office and they walk
right back out the door.
Often they're going to
friends, they're going
to family, they
want to be with their families.
We've heard a lot about that,
but unfortunately, many of these
families are patently
unsafe. And I have an
example of a young child
who right now is one of my clients
who's on the run. She
ran first at 12 years
old. She
is as an an IQ
somewhere around 65
and she just walked right out of the
office. Her father in
prison was able to tell
her how to find her homeless
mom, she found her
homeless mom and has been living
in tents. And
every time she got picked
up, they would bring her back to the office,
she would walk out the door
and go right back
very savvy with the, with the
bus system, etcetera. And
her mother would let her know because
she had a phone and
she had that unfettered
access to that
phone. So she communicate with the
people who could then pick her
up and bring her where she needs to go
find out where her mother is,
etcetera. She's
run at least 10 more
times and now she's
missing completely. The
last time I saw her, she had been picked
up and this little
girl had meth
and fentaNYL in her system
that had been given to her
by the people
in her mother's circle
that she'd been living with on
couches and tents all over
the city. She had
cuts on both arms,
self harming cuts.
And these are cuts that you don't, that
she was never what we would call
a cutter kid. But
there are things going on
in her life that are
so traumatizing
that it is resulting
in substance use,
additional
homelessness and
this sense of loyalty
to family that is and
the ability to just
walk right out into
that and get harmed more
and more and more.
And I've called law enforcement
repeatedly and they tell me
we'll keep an eye out for her,
but there's nothing we can do.
The law doesn't allow us
to do anything.
So they've stopped looking.
The mother has a felony
warrant, even
knowing that mom has a felony
warrant and knowing that if you picked
up mom, the child
would have nowhere to go.
They still don't look because
it's too hard to keep
runaway kids,
it in, you know, safely
in the custody of CYFD.
So I just wanted to mention
some of the things that we are
seeing that there's a lot
more to it right
now. We are
allowing these Children
in our system to
make decisions that will
ruin their lives.
We can counsel them as much
as we want as attorneys
for the Children as one
of the revolving costs, uh
PPWS that
work for them.
I know that there's this, this
constant idea that
we can just if we just
reason with them, right and talk
to them the right way. It
isn't always that simple
because a lot of therapy and
a lot of services are needed to
get a child out of that red
zone of stress into
some place where they can
have that more executive
function and think more clearly.
It is, there is a lot more
need than we are hearing
in a lot of these oversimplified
descriptions of what's going
on. So I just wanted
to share that with all of you because
this truly is a crisis.
I don't know how to fix it,
but law enforcement needs more
power to be able to work with these
kids to help. And I'm
not talking about putting them in the
home, but something
needs to happen so that
these kids don't
just walk right out the door,
that CYFD can
actually do something to
intervene. And also to
stop making workers
work over
mandatory overtime to the
point where they're so exhausted, they
have compassion, fatigue and
vicarious trauma that
is in
results in
the instigation and
perpetuation of the conflicts
that are in the office where kids
are getting hurt between with kid
to kid violence and kid
to uh worker
violence. So I
just wanted you to have that in
mind. Thank you very much for your
time and I'm happy to answer any
questions anyone may
have. My number is
5054402617.
And it's Alison Endicott
Quinones and I
have way
more to talk about than just that.
But this is an issue I wanted to
highlight today. Thank you,
chair. Thank you members of the
committee.
>> Alison. Before you
go
the agenda for this
week is not the only time we will
be discussing CYFD,
but this is the only time
we'll be here in Albuquerque.
So I wanted to
say if you had other things you
wanted to bring to our
attention, we
could conceivably
give you some time tomorrow.
If you, if you had, if you had
that interest to
speak about other things,
I would like to do that.
Thank you and looking at the
agenda
tomorrow,
I would think
uh during public
comment at 1130 we
could give you, you know,
an extended public
comment.
>> Absolutely. I
would love to do that and I would
be privileged to do
that. So 1130.
>> Yes, at 1130 tomorrow.
>> Absolutely. Thank you very
much. I will make sure
I have a lot more to share
with you in a
comprehensive way. No,
>> this, this is
extremely
upsetting but, but important
that we hear. Thank you.
>> Thank you. >> And
I wanted to read for, I, I thought
maybe she would be able to come, but
she said she can't. I
received an email
overnight from
um, a school
councilor here in, in
Albuquerque who's somebody
who's been contacting
me repeatedly
over the last year
about her concerns
around behavioral health issues
for Children. And
here's what she said,
Senator,
I was just reading the news
article about the committee meeting
regarding
Cyfd. I
wanted to let you know about
another issue I have run
into.
We all know there are not enough
resources in New Mexico
to address the mental
health,
behavioral health challenges
of all the Children in New
Mexico.
I'm currently working with a
family who
have a child with an extensive
trauma history
and a laundry list of
diagnoses
when Cyfd was
called on the family.
Recently,
the Cyfd protective
service worker told the
family that
they are tired of dealing with
this kid
that they don't believe her acting
out behaviors are related to
her trauma or mental
health.
They opted to put this
child into
a program through the
detention center
even though the child has no
charges
pending.
They also told the
parents to call
the police every time the child
acts aggressively.
This approach is not
going is not doing one
thing to protect the child
and provide her with meaningful
help, throwing
your hands up and throwing away
the child should
not be the approach of an
agency meant to protect
Children.
I guess we can,
we can,
you know, wonder whether that's an
accurate picture. Maybe
somebody didn't give the other side
of the story,
but that,
that, that would even be
voiced is just so
upsetting that that a
worker would, would have so
little understanding
of and,
and the agency says they're, they're
training people in trauma
informed care.
Uh that they would do. That
is kind of
strange.
So, uh Senator Lopez,
Senator
Stefanik,
>> thank you, Mr
Chair,
the statement you've just read and
also for what was shared just a
little bit ago,
um
raises many flags
of what's happening in our juvenile
justice system
today.
New Mexico has
been
at the forefront of making
some wonderful changes over the
last 20 years. And I know you know,
this too, Senator,
um when we talk, talk about
criminal about juvenile
justice reform
issues.
But I do believe
Mr Chair that what
you've read today,
um
hassid
maybe again, two
sides of the story.
But some of the cases
that I'm learning about that
exist in our own
youth services center here
in Bernalillo County,
um raised some serious
questions to me
and I think if the committee would know
a little bit more about
what's been happening there,
um I think would raise a lot of
concerns also.
Um So I'm hoping
that maybe at some point we
could also have a, a good
discussion on juvenile justice
and maybe Joe could come back
and share some
information
because we didn't get to his
presentation.
Um But I've been learning a lot, Mr
Chair about what's going on just
here. I don't know what's going
down in, in Doanna County.
I don't know what's happening up in
Farmington.
But if Bernal
Leo County's representative,
it's like an OMG.
Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Senator Lopez,
Senator Stefani, followed
by Senator Rodriguez, followed
by Representative Chavez.
>> So thank you, Mister chair. I'm just
wondering that perhaps we could
ask Cyfd,
what are the circumstances
if ever when they
reject a child in
their system or a
child
issue? So we,
we have them coming. So we should just
ask them directly. Thank
you
>> before we go to the rest
of the committee. And I, and I'll come back
to Senators Rodriguez and
Chavez, it turns out the woman who
sent me that
um
email today
is on the Zoom and
did want to speak. So,
uh Melissa Barry,
you want to speak for
uh up to three
or four
minutes?
Ok, good. We can
hear.
Thank you, Melissa. I, I
would, I would
say the
information we just heard
from uh all faith
about their new grant.
This would be a resource for
that family and
I would hope that that
CYFD and these
community resources would,
would be much more
closely linked than they've
been in the past.
Um
Yeah, exactly.
Well, thank.
>> Mhm
>> hm.
Well, thank you, Melissa
for bringing this to our attention.
Appreciate your your
following this issue with
us,
Senator Rodriguez
followed by Representative
Chavez. >> Thank you, Mr
Chairman. Um Good
morning um
to oh the lady out
on zoom also.
Um I don't know that I have
much to add. Um a
lot has been said and
many questions answered,
but I do know one
thing that
visually um
I'm having a hard time
understanding
how all this could
happen with a
child sent
to jail
detention.
And um
we don't have information
as to what's going to happen
to the child who is
out there watching out for the
child to make to
make sure that
his or her rights are
protected as a child.
Secondly, that
they have
representation
for legal
representation for the child
also in addition to
advocacy
um and
um just on and on,
I, I'm happy Mr Chairman
that Teresa Casados
is going to be here
because I do have
this question and more
for her regarding
cyf D's interaction
in a case like this.
Not only because the police,
apparently, according to this
lady who spoke was
they were the ones
who issued the referral
for this detention.
But as has been said,
for what if there was no
crime committed? How
can you refer a
anyone? It doesn't
have to be a child, but especially
a child in this case
to detention
for not committing a crime.
I, I don't understand
or because again,
they were fighting or whatever it may
be and with siblings,
whatever that may be. But anyway, Mr
Chairman, I, I'll just wait
to hear from the secretary from
Cyfd and we'll talk
later. Thank you.
>> Ok. Thank you, Senator
Representative Chavez.
And then there is one last public
comment on Zoom. I
understand.
Thank you.
>> Thank you, Mr
Chair.
You know, I, I just want to
say that
hearing the last
few comments is very
troubling and I think it's indicative
of the fact that
we can't keep doing the same old,
same old with CD.
We've got to do something different.
I want to echo
Senator Lopez
comments about the juvenile
justice system. I think we also
need to take a look at that and see what's
going on, especially here in
Bernalillo County,
that juvenile
justice many times
we forget because they're
teenagers and teenagers are
hard,
but we really need to pay
attention to that to them as
well. Um I
also have questions in terms
of the kind of training
that workers are receiving
at CYFD
and when the secretary is
here, I think that we should
ask her,
um, you know, some
specifics in terms
of, you know, the kind of trauma
informed training that they're getting
and the kind of workforce development
that they're doing, uh, within the
agency because I don't
think it's, it's sufficient. I don't
think it's consistent and I don't think
that it's enough. Um,
so we have a lot of work to do
CYFD,
um, needs some serious
revamping. Thank
you,
>> Representative Jones
to be followed by Representative
Thompson and then Gary
Josean on
the
Zoom.
>> Thank you, Mr
Chair.
I might have to leave at four o'clock
and I had, I had hoped to say a
few things that I'm gonna
go ahead and say now
because I may
not get a chance after the
secretary is here. I, I
really hope to hear some,
some positive
input from her, but
regardless, I
guess bottom
line, what has become
clear to me yesterday and
today as well is that,
is that we can't
keep doing the same thing over and over
again. We can't keep coming
here and,
and hearing the same stories and
even worse stories
like we just heard
from the attorney,
um, and not take
ownership of it because ultimately,
we make the laws
and we give them money
yesterday. I was shocked to
find out that we, they have more
money than they can even use
for reallocating money.
It's not a money
thing and,
and it's a huge problem
and I know we're all empathetic.
We all, every time we
hear these stories, we're empathetic
with Cyfd
workers and, and
uh and the secretary and,
and all the people that, that do
want change. But,
but
um
ultimately whose responsibility
is it? It's us.
We're, we are the
lawmakers and,
and the ones who decide how to use
the money. And so I
just feel like I,
I'm so tired
of going home feeling sick,
like physically ill
about what's happening to our
Children. And I know
you guys are too and
I just feel like
we have to take ownership
somehow. There were some positive
things we heard today.
Um, and
that have, that have given me
some hope. And I think,
you know, like you said,
just looking at it from a
different lens
and maybe just
restructuring and
so forth has to be
done
again.
But
um
got to make some changes.
I don't know what they are, but we
just have to own it and
regardless of what that
means. So
that's all. Thank you, Mr
Chair. >> Thank you,
Representative Jones
and Representative
Thompson.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. I'm,
I'm kind of um,
there's an elephant in the room
that we probably don't even
know about. And that's
kids with disabilities.
Some years ago, we
did a
um we
did one of our meetings
at the Youth Detention
Center and we got a tour
and I, I went
to where the classroom was and
asked how many of the kids
there had IEPs and
I believe she said between
70 80%.
So our special
education system
is,
um,
is also failing our
kids. The fact
that autism,
um, is, you know,
one in 32 kids
now and we don't
have a way to diagnose them.
And as a mom,
I can tell you raising a kid
with autism
will drive you to drink
or worse. Um, I
don't drink but,
um, I, I did,
I was clinically depressed
and suicidal raising
my son. And,
um, and we're not offering
support and we're not finding
those kids, those
kids are can
be very difficult
and especially if you
think that it's
misbehavior as
opposed to a
disability,
they're going to be treated much
differently.
Um I
wish that weren't the case, but I
think that is the case. So I,
I'm throwing it out there that
we're going to revamp special
ed. We're
gonna try. Um,
and I have good support
from the governor and,
and folks in her cabinet,
but let's
not lose track of the,
the, the fact
that a lot of these kids have
development
disabilities.
>> And apparently, thank
you representative.
Apparently, uh
Gary
Josean
agrees
with you. He didn't want to say anything
more. So I >> did hear
some >> cheering.
He was cheering
and
um, with that,
we conclude our public
comment and it's time for
lunch. We will
reconvene at one
o'clock. So we'll
see you back here at one o'clock with the
secretary, hopefully. Of
the department.
Oh, yeah.
