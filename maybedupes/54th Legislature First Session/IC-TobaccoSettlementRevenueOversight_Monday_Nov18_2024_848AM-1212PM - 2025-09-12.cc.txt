24.
Which is the northeast heights
of Albuquerque.
Nice to be here.
Good morning. I'm uh
Representative Joanne Ferrari
from uh Los.
Crus Don
House District 37, and glad to
be your vice chair this year.
And uh
John
The Hillary
You just introduce yourself,
Sean Dolan, staff attorney with
Legislative counsel Service.
Thank you. Thank you, everyone.
Uh, we're going to, since we
don't have a quorum, we're going
to have, we're going to go ahead
and start for informational
purposes and and do some
learning.
And uh the what we're looking to
do today is basically see what
we might come down to in terms
of legislation going forward,
uh, taxes, um,
Some other bills that are
potentially being proposed on
registries and also see what if
there's anything we need to do
to support the uh Department of
Health New PAC.
Uh, if there's anything
legislatively.
That would assist them, so
that's essentially our goal here
is we'll finish by noon.
And uh and I appreciate everyone
getting here early and so
without further ado, uh, Fred
Heinrich, uh, the general
counsel of Sutherland Park
Racetrack and Casino.
is going to be testifying for us
this morning and again this is
informal, so the back and forth
is is open and and OK, and
But if you'd introduce yourself.
the
we go.
Morning, Mr. Chairman, Vice
Chair and Representative
Thompson. My name is Fred
Heinrich.
And the general counsel and
compliance officer at Sunland
Park Racetrack and Casino.
Appreciate the opportunity to be
here with you today. I think
this is the 4th time I've
testified before this committee.
Um
Back in October, I sent Mister
Dole and some written comments
when I thought the committee was
meeting then.
Um
I suspect you probably have had
access to those, so I don't want
to sit here and read them to
you. I thought what I would do
is take a bigger picture
approach.
And talk about why the racetrack
casinos.
particular summa Park feels so.
Strongly about um.
Protecting our revenues, um, so
the racetrack casinos have a
carve out in the smoking ban
legislation in the state.
And um
We are very concerned about a
smoking ban at the racetrack
casinos impacting our revenues
very negatively.
Uh, studies have been done over
the years which have shown a
profound negative impact.
And as with any business, it's
all about revenues and expenses.
Um, we have, um.
A limited number of revenue
streams in the racetrack casinos
due to state law and the tribal
gaming compacts.
Um
Sun Park
would love to expand the casino.
Provide an even better
entertainment, uh, district and
uh or entertainment venue than
we already have.
Um, some Park, the city.
As labeled that area as the
entertainment district.
Across the street from us is
Western Playland.
That's a uh an amusement park.
Across the street across Sunland
Park Drive, um, a large music
venue, entertainment venues
coming in and then behind the
track uh closer to the Texas
state line is another
entertainment venue, smaller.
Music and.
Restaurant bar
Things like that.
So Salmon Park, the city is
working very hard on making an
entertainment district that will
draw a lot of people in from,
from El Paso.
In Donana County, uh, Las
Cruces, etc.
We have looked at expanding the
casino.
We would love to have table
games.
Baccarat, roulette, craps,
blackjack, we can't because of
state law.
Uh, we would love to expand the
number of slot machines we have,
we can't because of state law in
the gaming compact.
We'd love to expand our hours.
We cannot do that either.
Um, we would love to have uh a
sports book, build a nice sports
bar where people can come with
TVs.
Um, and sit and watch and place
bets, we can't because of state
law and the gaming compact.
So when we look at our revenue
streams, we are really limited.
In the number of revenue streams
we can have at the current time.
Um
And the other thing we're
looking at is trying to get a
different demographic into the
property.
It's an entertainment venue.
Um, if you walk through the slot
floor, you'll see a lot of
people, middle-aged and up, we
have a tough time getting the
younger generation in.
Um, and we want to do that, and
that's you do that through
things like sports books, table
games where there's more
interactive play going on, but
again, we can't.
Because of state law on the
gaming compact.
So
That's why we feel so strongly
about protecting our revenue
streams.
Um, there's differing studies
when you look at the various
studies that are out there, um,
there are some studies that say
there's a profoundly negative
impact on, on imposing a smoking
ban.
And race straight around casinos
in general. And there's one
study in particular that says,
yes, it's no big deal. COVID
changed everything.
When we came out of COVID in
2021.
In the mask mandate remained in
place, we saw a significant drop
in our revenues.
When the mask mandate was
lifted.
And smoking was again allowed
inside the casino, our revenues
went back up.
So
Whether you choose to believe
The studies that say there will
be no impact or whether you
choose to believe the studies
that say there will be an
impact.
We saw the impact.
Real world. That was the
consequence of
Smokey in the fact the smoking
ban because of the mask mandate.
So that's why
We are working very hard.
protect our revenue streams. We
don't have a lot of
opportunities to expand.
Revenue streams we have.
Um, and the flip side of it with
any business is the expenses.
Um, horse racing runs in the red
every year.
We lose a significant amount of
money on horse racing every
year.
And we picked up a new regulator
a few years ago, the federal
government.
And now regulated by the federal
government, HA.
Rua
thoroughbreds
regulated by the state racing
commission.
State gaming control board.
And uh ABC.
For our alcohol service. So our
expenses are going up.
Um, through the federal
regulations, um, we are seeing.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars
in increased cost.
Across the 5 race tracks.
There are federal assessments.
Um, there are increased staffing
costs due to more regulatory
requirements, as we all know,
you know, regulations don't
lower costs, they increase
costs.
So that is imposing additional
costs. So when we look at our
P&L,
From year to year
We see our revenue streams being
limited.
When we see our expenses going
up.
That's why we feel very strongly
and we, we, we recognize what
happened to us after COVID with
the mask mandate.
Um, we, that's why we feel very
strongly that we.
Don't want to lose the
opportunity for our patrons.
They have a cigarette and play
the same slot, their, their
favorite slot machine at the
same time.
So
Um
I know this is kind of econ or
finance 101 in terms of
businesses and I don't want to
beat a dead horse here, but um.
It's really important
That you understand.
The revenue stream limitations
we have, and that's why it's,
it's a big deal for us.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you
so much. So, um,
stuff
I've been asking around since
COVID to the Native American um
casinos and
They have
Kept smoking out.
Um, and say that their revenues
are higher than ever. Uh, the
guy who I think he's managing or
at one point was Isledta came
from North Carolina, where he
was in a uh in native casino.
And they brought smoking back.
After COVID and realized it was
hurting their revenue, so they
took it off.
And, and that's what I hear from
the, the, the pueblos and tribes
that I've talked to is that the
revenues are up.
So why do you think that you are
different?
Um, I think the tribal.
Um
The tribal gaming facilities in
this state are amazing.
Um, when Sandy reopened after
COVID.
They had um they had undergone
$100 million renovation to their
facility.
And I think they can offer
things that we can't offer.
Uh, one of the things I didn't
talk about and I should.
Is the um
The effective tax structure that
we have on our gaming revenues.
So 24.8% goes to the state in
the form of a gaming tax.
20% gets set aside for horse
racing purses.
25% of our, our GGR net net take
uh gaming revenue. It's set
aside for responsible gaming. So
when you add it all up, we've
got about a 45%.
Effective tax rate before we
even start paying our expenses.
The tribal
gaming compact.
Um
tops out at 10%.
And so they have more free money
to do things like capital
improvements, which is what we
want to do.
We would love to invest a
significant amount of money in
Southland Park and improve our
facilities to drive in more of
the Texas dollars and from El
Paso, but we have to look at our
ROI and the return on investment
just isn't there because we
can't improve the revenue
streams. So I, I think in in
short answer to your question,
Representative.
Um
It's, they can offer things we
can't offer.
Um, they have better facilities.
We're very proud of what we
have.
But when you go to Sandiarileta
or Santa Ana or Laguna, their
facilities are far and above.
What we can offer.
Thank you. Mr. Chair, um,
Is NMSU still a part owner of
Sunland Park. They are not. They
are not. OK, thank you.
And then um you said horse
racing is a loser, and you're,
you're here saying you, you
know, you can't do anything
cause you don't have enough
money, but you're losing money
on horse racing. Do you feel
like it's OK to put your workers
in a tobacco zone.
So that you can keep doing
racing, that's losing, I mean,
to me that would be the, the
first step would be to dump the
losing parts of your business
and we can't, we can't, we can't
because you have to have a horse
racing license.
Have a gaming license.
And there's only 5.
5 of us in the state, Hobbs,
Sunland, Ridoso, Albuquerque,
and then uh Farmington.
So you have to have a racetrack
to have a casino in the state.
But our hands are tied.
You know, we're we're doing
business with one hand tied
behind our backs, frankly. So
just for my um education, are
there a certain number of races
you have to have, yes. OK. Thank
you, Mr. Chair.
As a bit of additional
background, um.
Back in the day, horse racing
was really on its last legs, and
casino gaming was brought in.
Um, roughly 25 years ago to keep
horse racing alive because it's
an important industry to the
state of New Mexico. It's got a,
a lot of history, um, there's a
lot of backstory, a lot of good
horses have come out of the
state.
And the racetrack casinos have
kept it alive.
I, if I, if I call horse racing
a loser, I didn't mean to do
that. We're we're losing money
on horse racing every year.
Um
So
And there have, there has been
no major overhaul.
Of the
Gaming legislation.
In 25 years, 20 or 25 years.
Um, and that's, you know, we
would love to see that. We will
never effectively compete with
the tribes.
We won't, we can't.
Because of horse racing.
And because they have facilities
and opportunities and and uh.
Less expenses than we do, we
will never effectively compete
with them.
We would love to see an
opportunity to have a bigger
picture discussion.
between the state, the gaming
tribes, and the five racetrack
casinos.
To talk about how do we change
the landscape for all of gaming.
Because we're getting left
behind.
Um
of the racetrack casinos,
Sunland.
Riodosso to a lesser extent, but
also over in Hobbs.
Bring in a lot of money from
Texas.
Uh, Las Vegas Sands Corporation
has poured millions of dollars
into lobbying in Texas.
Um, to get gaming legalized in
Texas. It's a process that's
going to take some time.
Uh, but as soon as that happens,
The racetrack casinos are gonna
feel it, uh, and the state's
going to feel it. I mean,
there's a, there's a partnership
here between the state, the
horsemen.
In the tracks
Because of the way the revenues
from the gaming are shared.
And all of us are going to feel
it when Texas legalizes gaming.
Arizona has sports betting and
then they have sports betting on
their phones, mobile sports
betting, it's all geo-fenced,
you have to be within the
boundaries of Arizona, Colorado
has done the same.
Other states are, are moving
along with the industry, and
we're getting left behind.
And I would really love to see
the state.
In the tracks and the tribes sit
down and figure out what can we
do to catch up.
Before we get left too far
behind in this industry.
Thank you, Mister Chair, and
thank you, Mr. Heinrich. All
you're talking about the horse
racing and getting left behind,
do you think?
Um, part of the problem is um
the outbreak of the um.
Equi infection, anemia.
Yeah
You know, has devastated many
horses to be lost and not having
a good process to follow, um, to
for um.
Not spreading the disease, um,
you know, do.
You know, the uh injections and
things like that.
From what I understand, EIA was
at one point thought to be like
polio. It was almost eradicated.
And so what's popped up in the
last 6 months, 6 to 9 months.
Um, has come as a surprise to a
lot of people, um.
I know from conversations with
both the racing commission.
And the livestock board.
and the USDA that they are all
looking deeply into what, how
this happened.
Um, so yeah, it's a concern back
in in about 4 years ago, we
suffered.
Oh let me stick with the EIA for
a second.
The spread of EIA is through
Uh, it's blood, it's blood
transmitted, I guess, bloodborne
disease.
And they have not figured out
yet why so many horses have.
Contracted it. Um, but
The person we spoke to at USDA
said that it could not have been
naturally transmitted through a
fly bite or other insect bite
that it had to be human.
And it's very easy.
Um
For that to happen without
anybody seeing it because you
can't be everywhere all the
time.
Um, when Sunland is in its race
meet.
Um, we have about 1600 horses on
the backside.
And you can't have
representatives everywhere
watching everything that
happens.
Um
When they do figure out
how that was transmitted.
And they figure out who.
Participated in transmitting it.
Which wasn't anybody at any of
the tracks.
Um, I hope.
That very
Significant consequences, maybe
even a lifetime ban.
I'm participating in the sport
is imposed on that person, but
Um, I, I know the investigation
is still underway, but it's,
yeah, it's a very serious issue
that we're.
Um, at Sunland, we're going to
take some actions to try to make
sure that that doesn't happen.
In our place
Well, as a legal person, I can
understand your.
Response to that, but they do
know it's from illegal doping
and it's from so many horses not
being uh isolated and stopped
from racing. They've been
transferred even to California
and Texas, and they're all upset
about it. The horses are having
to be euthanized and um they do
know how this is happening
because NMRC did not stop it and
was not behind it, and there's
should be a big investigation
about it. So if you're so
worried about, you know, making
money.
because people can't smoke at
the casinos and racetrack.
I think that's way off, you
know, you should be off your
radar and can you tell us about
what studies you're saying or
showing that you know smoking
makes it so more people will
come. Um, they were in my
comments from my October 16th.
There was a study by the Federal
Reserve Bank of Saint Louis.
It showed the impact on the
smoking ban in Illinois.
It was a 12 12.3% decline.
A union gaming.
Did a study in 2019 smoking ban
effects in the United States.
Um, they looked at 6
jurisdictions, Illinois.
Colorado, Delaware, New Orleans,
South Dakota.
And Baton Rouge
Loss of 16.3%.
Uh, Spectrum gaming group.
Did a study in 2021.
Uh, for New Jersey.
There was a loss between 4.2 and
10.9%.
And uh
I beg to differ that this is a
really scientific study. It
could be just, you know, uh, an
assumption that these losses
were because of uh tobacco
because we do have in our state
where they're showing.
That it does increase, you know,
people coming to the casinos
more often.
And
Um, I, I don't think that's, you
know, something that we can rely
on in making a decisions against
this. Um,
And also uh the revenue stream.
Um
From tobacco use, I don't think
well, you were saying that's
because they'd have a decline in
people coming.
Um
When there should be an increase
because so many more people
don't smoke and would be um.
Wanting to be in that atmosphere
that it's clean, uh, and also,
um.
Um
We know that, you know,
employees need to be protected.
And no matter how much you know,
uh, filtering you do of the air,
they're still going to have
that, um.
effect on their health, and
that's something that we are
here to care for and um
I think if there's other things
that you could do besides um
Just continuing to have smoking
available, you know, to increase
the revenue stream and also to
protect the horses so that, you
know, more people aren't losing
or, you know, um.
Having this
Especially the horses to have to
be euthanized because of this.
It's just tragic.
is
I agree with you 100%
representative there's people
who are responsible and know how
to stop it and should have.
Even back in February, and they
didn't. They just let it
continue because of greed, and
that's what I think we should be
careful.
So thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you. um.
Is there um
Anyway, you talk about
increasing sources of revenue
and, and I do not understand the
legal.
Components of uh gaming and
restrictions.
Um
And you say that right, that
currently the regulation
prohibits you from expanding
into the sports betting and and
other activities.
Are you in the other?
non-Native American casinos
exploring an avenue to open up
that regulation.
Um, it's, it's state statute and
we would love to sit down. We've
had some conversations with some
of the gaming tribes about it.
Um, but as you would expect,
just like we are protecting our
business, they would like to
protect their business.
Um, I'm convinced personally.
if representatives from the
gaming tribes in the state and
the racetrack casino sat down.
There's a win win win out there.
Where
And it's not gonna be
Maybe a quick conversation and
may not be an easy conversation,
and I'm sure there's going to be
lots of disagreement.
Along the way
I am convinced in my heart of
hearts that there's a win, win,
win out there for the tribes,
the state and.
race tracks.
Uh, second question.
Um
is people who smoke and go to
the casino, they're smoking, um.
Other people who come who don't
smoke, obviously are exposed to
secondhand smoke including
employees, do you or any of the
other casinos have a
Um
Almost like a cigarette pack
warning. Beware of secondhand
smoke can be harmful to your
health and cause cancer just at
least so that they're aware of
it. Um, we, we.
Or, um
When we do our, so we're talking
about employees on the one hand
and and guests on the other,
right? let me talk about the
employees first.
When our
When we go through our our
interview process, our hiring
process.
People who are going to work on
the casino floor are made aware
that there's smoke, there's a
non-smoking section, and then
there's a smoking section of the
casino.
They're, they are made aware
that from time to time they may
have to work in the smoking
section.
And it's usually in and out.
They're they're.
Our staff walks around a lot,
uh, just taking care of guests
needs and and things like that.
Um
And they're also made aware that
if they want a mask, we will
provide that to him at no cost.
Um
If you haven't been to Sunland
Park.
The smoking side of the casino.
Has um Representative Ferrari
talked about our, our, our
technology, it's got what's
called a casino air system that
actually scrubs the air.
Filters are changed regularly.
And we have 30 ft ceilings in
there so a lot of the smoke
dissipates, gets lost up in the
ceiling.
Um, so depending on what day it
is and how many people are
smoking in there. You may or may
not even realize that there's
smoking going on.
Um, so it's, it's not, I, I grew
up in the blue collar suburbs of
Chicago, and there was a uh a
bowl.
alley that my friends and I used
to go to a couple blocks from
our house, you know, low
ceilings, a lot of smoking going
on and you'd go home and your
clothes would smell like smoke.
That's not the case.
by us at Sumon Park.
Um, I can't speak for the other
casinos, the other racetrack
casinos in in the state.
A note about the tribal casinos,
um.
As I mentioned earlier, they can
offer a lot more.
Then we can right now.
Um, and I think
Part of the reason they didn't
take a hit on the revenues was
because of all these other
offerings that they have.
Um, the other thing is if they
decide.
That they want to go back to
smoking. It's a decision that
they can make on their own.
Without
The involvement of the state.
They could just flip a switch
and go back to smoking if they
decided to do that.
So that's, they have more
flexibility in that regard than
we do.
Um, our patrons.
Um
You know, the smoking and
non-smoking sides of the casino
are pretty clearly delineated.
Um, we don't have any sort of
warnings up. Um, we can
certainly look at putting
something up, um, like that, um,
I don't think there would be
any, any problem with doing
that.
Thank you. And
my last question I make one
comment about our employees.
We have a lot of really long
term employees on the casino
side. We have people who have
been working there 1015, 20
years.
Um, and we have never had
anybody say I want no smoking
assignment.
Just hasn't happened.
For whatever it's worth.
You
Uh, last question is all 5
non-Native American.
Casinos allow smoking is that
correct? I, I don't know the
answer to that question, um.
I don't know the answer and I
don't want to guess.
OK, I'm sorry.
OK, thank you. Um, again, we are
in informal session here, so I'm
going to take that prerogative
and call on uh
Uhheita.
To see if you have any comment
on smoking in
Uh
casinos. I, I recall from last
year.
That, uh, you did.
Have some observations and I
just wanted to be able to get
that.
Mister Chair.
Mr. Chair Mahesh Sito, the
American Heart Association.
think
You know, we
2 years ago, we
Carried the legislation.
And
The evidence is pretty.
well
that
You know, the revenues.
Uh
And
In tribal casinos have
increased.
Since they stopped.
You know, ban smoking in their
casinos.
And
There there's overwhelming
evidence and studies done.
By
Several
Respected
You know, independent
Groups that have shown.
You know, smoking.
Yeah.
So there's ample evidence, uh,
Mr. Chair.
Uh
Shows like, you know, smoking
has.
Has no impact.
Banning smoking has no impact on
on revenues in the casinos.
And even Las Vegas is mowing
towards that direction, there
are, you know, certain casinos
going smoke free.
And, you know, the, the impact.
The health impact
Is is devastating to those.
exposed to secondhand smoking,
heart disease, you know, uh.
Emphysema
And, you know.
And also,
Uh, there's a trade group that
That uh
You know, manufacturers air
circulating and air cleaning
system, filter systems.
They have put up a statement, a
paper saying like, you know,
there is no.
Technology.
That can scrub, you know,
secondhand smoking, smoking
from.
You know, casinos.
Thank you.
Um
OK, uh,
In the last comments, uh, Mr.
Heinrich for the committee.
Um, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um,
regarding Vegas, um, Nevada, if
if the casinos are going
non-smoking.
They're doing that
On their own.
The state of Nevada has not
instituted any sort of smoking
ban.
Likewise, Atlantic City, New
Jersey has not.
Institute a smoking ban.
Um, all we're asking is that
because of that, um.
The constraints on our ability
to generate revenues.
That we just leave this alone,
let the marketplace decide.
Um, if the state would like to
see us put up some warnings, we
can certainly look at doing
that.
Yeah, there's only 5 properties
in the state.
Um, they were talking about and
um.
Yeah, we, we just because of
everything else we need to.
to maintain our revenue streams.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Oh yes, OK, we have 2 more
questions on your last comment,
um.
You are just um insistent that
it's going to deteriorate.
You know, take away from your
revenue stream instead of like.
We believe and have seen that
more people will come to the
casinos, and it could possibly
increase your revenue stream.
So, you know, we're gonna have
this conflict of, you know, uh.
You're perceived.
You know, um
Effect of stopping the smoking.
I would never go into a casino
before and now that I've been to
some that is an in Vegas last
week, um, that where they didn't
have smoking. It wasn't where I
rushed through. It was something
that, you know, I found, you
know, um, much more enjoyable to
be there. And I think, you know,
you should flip that, you know,
idea.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um,
Madam Vice Chair.
Um, I, I respect that.
And I think there's probably
other people like you.
Um,
We come back to what we saw
coming out of COVID with the
mask mandate. I mean, and, and
whether there there are studies
on both sides of the issue.
Um, when we look at which
studies we're going to follow,
um, we're gonna
You know, we, we believe what we
saw the actual impact coming out
of COVID.
And there was a pent up demand.
For entertainment
Coming out of COVID because
everybody was um stuck at home
for so long, and we would have
loved to have seen.
Our revenues go up, um, with the
mask mandates still in place.
No, we took a serious hit.
Um
20+% hit in our, in our gross
gaming revenue, even though
there was this pent up demand.
Mr. Chair, I'm sorry I didn't
recognize you before, um, Mr.
Heinrich, um.
I don't think there's a strong
correlation. There might have
been a um.
Pent up demand, but also it took
a while for people to feel safe
again to go into public, and I
think you're blaming that
because of the tobacco um.
For the wrong reason.
Thank you, Mr. I almost called
you Mr. Speaker, I guess I'm
getting ready for a session.
Mr. Chair. Um, so I think it's.
A mistake, if not disingenuous
to look at COVID and mask
mandates that was that was
totally separate, I mean. Yeah,
I think everybody mean that
everything was closed and then
when it opened as representative
Frey said.
People were still very hesitant,
me included, to uh to go where
there were people, a lot of
people, so I, I, I, I find that,
um.
Discouraging that you're using
COVID as, as, but my, my
question is, um, you know, I've
been reading a lot of stuff
about um.
The racing commission and how so
many people think it's corrupt
or or, you know, not doing a
good job or, you know, whatever
word you want to use, and I
wonder how much of that has to
do with your decrease, uh,
decreased, um.
Income is because people are
very wary of.
Of what the racing commission is
and isn't doing.
Mr. Chairman, Representative
Thompson.
I'm not sure how to answer the
question. I've I've never had
the experience with the racing
commission being corrupt.
Um,
Um
not doing the best possible job
it can do.
As a regulator in our industry.
Um
And quite, quite to the
contrary, um, I, I think the
current.
Commission and staff works very
hard to provide a good
environment for horse racing in
New Mexico.
I'm not sure what you're
referring to.
Um, in that regard, but, um,
it's, it's um it's an agency
that I think is is doing a
really good job in this state.
Um, there's not, there's a
little bit of overlap.
Between our horse racing patrons
and our casino patrons.
But not a lot. In other words,
there are some people that come
in to watch horse racing and
place bets.
Um, that go into the casino, but
most of them are there for the
racing only and, and they're not
also casino patrons. So, um, I
And to be honest with you, they,
they come.
For entertainment and and they
don't get hung up and.
Um
You know what's going on?
With the regulatory bodies
they're they're generally not
very interested in that.
Thank you for that, Mr. Chair.
But I mean, and I'm not saying
there is corruption, I don't
know. I've been reading articles
in various papers that there is
concern along those lines, so,
um, you know, people who read
that may may be hesitant to.
get in the game as it were, um,
so thank you, that's all I have,
Mr. Chair.
OK, thank you. Um, they're being
no further questions. Thank you
for coming and stating your case
for, appreciate that. And um I
do want to point out there is
coffee now, is that correct? And
anyone in the room is more than
welcome to it.
Um, we are for those who weren't
here earlier. Uh, we don't have
a quorum and uh last time we
didn't have a corm. Uh, we had a
great, uh, what I call informal
meeting, educational meeting,
and in that spirit, I have asked
that uh Meg Bolter returned to
further discuss this issue of
the registries. I, I will
acknowledge that uh there is a
Movement among some of the
tobacco producers to create that
registry, and as I recall from
our last meeting, it looked as
if that creating that registry
created a huge uh
Financial burden for the
regulatory agencies are evidence
of that was presented, uh, and
those who have approached me in
this regard, say, well, no, that
would be actually taken care of
for because every product.
That, uh, it goes to the
register that comes before the
alcohol uh regulatory authority.
For approval and and again, it's
this uh.
Very well laid out and of crazy
where you go to the federal
government that refuse you, but
you're able to go on anyway and
so forth, but there, and so
where does all this fit and, and
one of the
Uh, retorts by those asking for
registry by understanding that
the registry is to keep the
particular the Chinese mass
produced vaping products and,
and now nicotine pouches and
whatever else out of circulation
that each
Uh, product that gets registered
would come with a fee.
For registration.
To enable
The uh
Hiring an expansion of staff.
To put for to actually do the
registration.
And so, um,
again we're in an informal
process and I don't want to deny
you a cup of coffee or anyone
else, but when, whenever you'd
be willing to come forth and
repeat for us because I think
it's we, we need to understand,
uh, you know, unfortunately,
regulation is not a one and
done. Type of activity, it, it's
something that needs to be
understood in all of the kind of
Sabarosa components of the.
regulation we could understand
that one more time and, and then
also, um,
The
Benefits
Of
Having some type of registry and
having a cost to try and keep.
Uh, the Chinese products out,
but also some of the legislation
has talked about not doing any
uh youth.
Advertising or packaging.
Such that it would appeal to
youth, and so, uh, that's why we
asked you to come back and so we
can try and
Look at this and see, is there
any benefit or is this, as I
recall you said Kansas
discovered it it uh.
took a um significant amount to
do because there were like over
6000 products and.
What have you
So I'm hoping that you're
willing to
Uh, give us a little refresher
course.
And the technicalities of the
regulation and in the insights
that you would have because one
way or the other this
Legislation is going to come
forward, and I think that we
need to be informed about it,
um.
To see if there's really.
Overall, if, if it's a just a
ruse to actually decrease
regulation or if it's something
that would be a benefit in terms
of being able to keep out is
very cheap.
Um
foreign products and also have
an impact on their marketing and
packaging, such as what the
federal government did with
Jewel. So, um, this is a, a back
and forth, um, this is not a uh
uh a formal, we we don't have to
thank Mr. Chair, Richard.
Oh, Megan.
Yeah
Yeah, she's, I, she's, I'm, I
started out inches.
Um
Yes.
I don't know what that means.
Mine, it's just on a normal
Google drive. Do you want me?
OK,
I'm just waiting for my, I got
it.
Yeah.
I mean
As long as you just
OK.
Great. Thank you again, I
appreciate, um, the committee
members are here.
Appreciate it. I've met you
before. Um, we have actually
asked for um preemption cation
legislation in the past, but I
would like to clarify a few
points. Uh, we know that the
industry is in a number of
states, um, there are only 4
states right now that currently
have e-cigarette directors, but
I'm gonna kind of just give you
a little bit of background
before, before we get to the
point of why the few states that
have actually adopted and
implemented them, um, if
anything.
Uh
I, I'm sorry, I just, I feel
like I might be shouting at you
it's OK. OK.
Um, and then, um, the states
that have passed them since then
and how they've evolved since 4
years ago when the first one or.
2020, when the first one was
introduced.
Um, I'm with the Preventing
Tobacco Addiction Foundation,
Tobacco 21, um, I won't work on
point of sale policies with
respect to youth access and use
of tobacco products.
Um, we do have grades for
various states. Um, we look at
preemption policies, sale
policies, illegal products, as
well as those that are legal for
sale. I just want to give you an
idea that we work with a number
of here is a collaborative
effort, however, this is not
endorsement by any um.
Again, I'd like to start with
law as a social determinant of
health. So without law and
enforcement, you can't really
effectuate the objective of a
piece of legislation. So looking
at some of the gaps that could
help improve the registry would
have a very deleterious impact
on existing problems within um
tobacco regulation in New
Mexico.
Um, so for tobacco legislation,
I just want to give you a little
bit of the introduction, um, the
point of sale policies we're
going to go over what underage
sales versus illicit sales, um,
are pertain to, um, some of the
trends that was the past. I
wasn't sure if you wanted me to
repeat from the previous, but
we'll stick to registries for
today.
Um, a few points of contention,
um, that some people sometimes
get confused underage sales
versus the illegal sales. So all
tobacco products are illegal for
sale in the US for those under
the age of 21. Some states have
yet to raise their minimum legal
sales age 221, that does not
mean that they cannot be
compliant. So for those states
that have raised their age to
21, they usually have to have an
enforcement and surveillance
mechanism, we'll get into that
later, but I just want to make
sure that we're aware that this
is different than just reg.
Sorry, um, retail violation rate
is usually I'm referring to um
RVR is the percentage of
retailers that violate underage
sales inspections and a
percentage of those, there's a
threshold for that states have
to abide before they lose
federal funding.
Um, I'm sorry, um.
I have now switched to
There are not 53. Those are my
notes, pages.
Oh, no problem, yeah.
That's OK.
I can take a break cause it
doesn't make sense if I'm, and I
thought, I'm sorry, I thought
She's working on the slides.
So, uh,
Uh, so when you hear PMTA, um, a
lot of the times this registry
legislation refers to FDA
approval. That is not a term.
FDA authorization simply uh
authorizes the sale of a
specific product. So when you
see that pre-market tobacco
application, PMTA. Notice the
term pre-market. That
application must go through a
vetting process, a full
evaluation before it is
authorized.
not approved because approve
indicates a medical device or
treatment for a specific
condition.
So authorization means you've
already been vetted, and now
that product has been determined
to be appropriate for the
protection of public health,
among other things, and that it
is not attract minors, or it
doesn't have an uptake, and even
after a product, um, acquires a
PMTA, a final marketing order.
It is still subject to reports
to the FDA to indicate that it
has not been having uh some
safety issues or that it has not
become a product that has a high
youth use. So please.
Do not be deceived by the idea
that simply because a product is
on the market, it is legal or
the FDA has seen it at all or
has evaluated in in full. Um,
last preemption, we won't go
into it, but again, keyword and
uh eventually we'll we'll hear.
Um
So I just want to go over the
two different types. So, we have
sales to, um, um, miners and you
can just start clicking through,
and these include at the federal
level, you are required to check
a person's ID under the federal
law. You're not allowed to sell
to minors, um, if you go. Yeah,
perfect. Um, you're not allowed
to sell to Meyers, you must
require ID verification for
those under the age of 30, even
if your state law says 27 or 23
in Montana, you must have a
reason.
reasonable suspicion that
they're under the age of 21 and
then you, as long as there's a
reasonable doubt, you must
check, but the federal law has
made it clear that, um, the rule
was for the federal T21 that you
are required to check that ID if
the person is under the age of
30 and vending machines must
only be in 21 and over
facilities. Again, in other
states, some of those laws allow
vending machines to be within
sight of an employee at a
restaurant, the federal law has
made it clear that under T21 ID
verification, if the person
looks under the age of 20.
Or 30, excuse me, and uh that
you must, um, all vending
machines must be located. Now
your state law is very clear
with respect to vending
machines, but what I'm saying is
that ambiguity has allowed some
to kind of evade the idea of
what that federal law was
attempting to achieve. At the
state level, you can have a
variable minimum legal sales
age, Alaska at 19, Montana is
still at 18. There's still a few
holdout states, however, they
are still subject to the federal
law. So regardless of how they
enforce, they are still required
by federal law to check that ID.
they are not allowed to sell to
minors and federal inspections
will cite retailers that sell to
those under 21, even if the
state does not effectuate those
inspections. You have different
verification ideas, some, some
require electronic ID
verification, some do not. At
the local level, you can have a
variable minimum legal sales age
doesn't matter, you still have
to abide by 21. Cities can adopt
21 as their minimum legal sales
age, and there is enough data to
show that even without
enforcement, there is a
significant change.
In terms of compliance rates,
meaning just raising the the law
alone requires, uh, would allow
you for, uh, uh, it's not gonna
work we're dancing out of that
sink here. Can you back it up,
please?
Thanks. Um,
The local law can have different
ID verification laws that are
more stringent than a state law.
However, again, better law
trumps all. So for unauthorized
illicit sales products that
we're looking at. The FDA
evaluates and authorizes tobacco
products for sale. Currently
there are only 34 e-cigarette
products with marketing granting
orders. That means 34 products,
not just e-cigarettes
altogether. There's units,
there's like battery packs, all
of that.
That are um authorized for sale
in the US. So if we're looking
at a registry that only includes
FDA authorized products, and
this is what you're hearing from
the industry, then those are the
34 products that should be
allowed.
In consideration of the
traditional tobacco products are
a different entity altogether.
So 34 e-cigarette products
currently to date, they do keep
authorizing a few more. There's
only 4,
flavored products for menthol
views solo e-cigarettes, um, so
just be aware that as far as a
marketing granted orders, only
34, currently. States cannot
authorize products for sale.
That is solely the subject and
purview of the FDA and the
federal government.
States cannot evaluate
applications, check the
marketing plans and making sure.
Now they can look at time,
place, and manner of sale, but
that has nothing to do with
whether a product is legal for
sale in the US. States can
regulate sales like um tax,
marketing and type in New Mexico
does have a state law that
prohibits packaging that's
attractive to minors like the
celebrity brand Mike Tyson uses,
um, Chance the Rapper. You'll
see a lot of the banana pearl,
all this kind of, um, puff bar.
How they sell to minors. Cities
cannot authorize products for
sale either. Cities can regulate
sales with tax marketing and
type.
On unconditionally has to be
consistent in most cases with
state law. However, notice the
difference, and they will
conflate the two. If they can't
get you with the illegal sales
or the illicit or scare you with
the possibility of Chinese
products, they will look at, oh,
but this will prohibit a lot of
the products that our kids are
using. Well, unfortunately,
transparency, a lot of the kids
are using products from your
local vape shops that are being
independently manufactured here
with parts manufactured that are
being in packaged here, both
parts manufactured in.
China much like much of our US
production. So these scare
tactics are not only racist, but
they're also deceptive. Um, so
I've already gone over the
tobacco slide,
sorry, yes, please,
and again, if you have them.
You can, we're doing informal
education and then we'll.
Going to formal committee
meeting, but the, if, if the, if
the pieces are manufactured
outside of the US.
And then
Assembled here in the US. Is
that put them into a
Uh, FDA approved category? No.
OK.
So how do they, how do they get
imported?
If
Because they're not
Put together
I mean, wouldn't they shouldn't
importation be stopped at at
ports.
You would hope, um, both federal
enforcement is not great,
there's now a multi-agency task
force that's looking on these
unauthorized products, they're
not just fully, um, uh, fully
constructed units, but it's
similar to an iPhone. You get
many of your parts or cell phone
parts from other countries,
whether they're vetted or not,
they could be looked at as, um,
specific parts for cars or
specific part for electronics,
but they're not just necessarily
divided in that sense, but the
idea about registries is that
they will eliminate the illegal
market of Chinese vapes. And
yet, if you look at the focus of
what is illegal on the market
today. Much of that are
e-liquids, e-cigarette products
that are manu manufacturer is
the wrong word, that are
constructed using parts from
abroad because they're cheaper.
I mean, it's what we, we all
order from Amazon or some people
are from TMO and She and all
that, but the what they're
talking about is the.
The the the e-cigarette market
of illegal products that have
yet to undergo any FDA
evaluation, and they're blaming
that on a, on a foreign market.
It could be Chinese, it could be
whomever. However, the number of
local independent vape shops and
tobacco manufacturers have many
products in the pipeline or have
not submitted a PMTA, and those
are domestic products, and those
products are just as illegal as
any that are coming across from
another country. And when you
talk to Brian.
King Center for Tobacco
Products. He'll even say in
these conferences and in these
panel members that domestic
market creates quite a bulk of
the illegal products. So the
idea that somehow a registry is
going to keep those products off
the market, and I'll get into
the ones that have already have
registries existing, is that
you'll see that the majority of
our local independent vape shops
in the US are those that are
trying to avoid the registries
because their products would be
considered illegal for for sale
in the US.
Does that make sense? They in
that state that adopts a
registry.
Mr. Chair, um, now that we have
corum, could we establish and
introduce a senator.
Yes, OK, we now have a quorum.
And Senator.
Uh, thank you, Mr. Chair, Madam
co-chair, Linda Lopez, state
senator, District 11, which is
the southwest quadrant of Bernao
County.
And apologies, I'm late this
morning, but I dropped my
daughter off at school at 8:15
in the morning.
Getting through the big eyes
like a whole.
excursion in Albany.
We are gave in.
Um
The,
uh the
meetings we've had worked. Yeah,
good point. So, um, again, all
these different pieces, and this
is where I'm trying so that we
have the link, we have the
language and the rationale to be
able to look at this carefully,
so.
All these in theory,
These things are being imported
and maybe our new president is
going to throw such a tariff on
anything that comes into the
country or raise the expense,
but that's
be seen somewhere in the future
if that should happen, but they
come in, they get assembled.
They're not approved by the FDA.
Yet
Um
They're, they're being somehow
distributed.
Legally or at least there's no
one.
Stopping the distribution into
the distributors and then the
sales and um.
The
It is, so I'm what I'm, is there
another way that we could stop
that.
Distribution
Uh, process the FDA has formed a
multitask enforcement agency.
They've they've conducted a
number of seizures,
unfortunately quite minimal, um,
overall, you know, um, 700
million worth in one place, uh,
and I actually I've taken some
of those slides out since it was
so long last time, but I'm happy
to share with you some of those,
um, uh, news releases. Um, but
so any product that has not
undergone FDA review with a
marketing order.
that has been granted by the,
the FDA.
Is illegal for sale in the US.
So the majority of products,
regardless of where they come
from, whether from abroad or
created, developed, manufactured
and distributed here are illegal
for sale. Currently only 34 of
those products which can include
a battery pack, that kind of
thing, have gone through that
PMT process and been granted a
marketing granted order. The
majority have been granted
marketing denial orders, either
because of insufficient material
in the application process and
we'll go through that just so
that you can see the reality
And, and I, I will say industry
knows.
That most legislatures and most
laymen don't have the capacity
time or resources to go through
and vet what the FDA does
compared to what the state does.
So it sounds amazing, right? It
sounds, oh, this is a solution,
we'll have a registry, we'll
create this list, we'll have a
list of just the products that
are allowed in the US, but what
they don't tell you is, wait,
wait, wait, not all the list
will include just those, those
34. It'll include products that
have yet to undergo FDA.
Review. Not only will we allow
products that the FDA has
reviewed, denied, and said no,
this is not subject to sale in
the US, but we're going to hold
it up in litigation so it can
remain on the market. And you'll
see Alabama's list, 99.9% of
those either marketing just
denial order, uh, PMT under
review or litigation.
And those products are allowed
to be marketed in Alabama based
on that state registry. In
contradiction to the FDA's
regulatory authority, which
prohibits 99% of those products
on the market. Now the Food and
Drug and Law Institute since our
last meeting in October, had a
conference where all tria
representatives were there and
presented on this, and they
said, well, we'll settle that at
the Supreme Court. And you
wonder why, because the PMTA
process, it's rigorous and your
chances of approval are
Excuse me. Authorization are
quite low.
So if you're waiting on the FDA
and you have a Supreme Court
that's quite.
Somewhat uh reluctant to enhance
regulation or provide for FDA
authority. You wait it out and
it's a very smart tactic.
However, no state as of yet has
been able to fully implement a
registry because of the cost,
because of the overwhelming
number of submissions. And
because of that conflict with
the FDA, several AGs, Minnesota,
uh, Ohio, Arizona, New Jersey
have sent letters to all
retailers saying
subject to seizure and
enforcement if you continue to
sell products that have yet to
be authorized under our federal
authority. So we'll get into
that a little bit, but I just
want to make sure that one of
the tactics to make it seem like
it's urgent, necessary and
inevitable is to blame foreign
manufacturers. And one of the
problems is you encompass all of
the vape market that doesn't
necessarily include the big 3
tobacco companies. We call them
legacy.
manufacturers. So interestingly
enough,
Not necessarily that they've
been on the same side, but
public health.
Um, organizations and like
independent vape shop, the um.
I've got to get their name
wrong, but it's the um
It's a uh lobbying association
that lobbies on behalf of
independent e-cigarette vape.
Owners. Um, and they have been
on the same side opposing
registries, because for one, in
most cases, the mom and pop
shops that develop their own
products or sell products that
have yet to be FDA authorized,
cannot afford to go through the
PMTA process. And there is,
there are problems with FDA
enforcement. They need to get on
it, but they also have a lack of
funding. That's why they've been
joined the DOJ, um, the US
Marshals Service, um, customs
and immigration, the ATF, and
we'll go into that later.
Because they need more help and
they need more funding to
enforce the number of products
they're growing in all the
states and the registries are
just one more bump to allow them
to do that, because now you've
created a federal state conflict
that can only really be heard by
the Supreme Court of the US.
And we're hoping it doesn't get
there simply because it's
already been designated the full
authority of the FDA to regulate
these products. Your State
Department of Revenue,
Department of Taxation, or
attorneys general office are not
food and drug enforcement
officers. They're not food and
drug and, um, um, administration
officials or part of the tobacco
products scientific Committee.
How will they evaluate these
products that want to be proved
on the list.
So the idea is it's just
creating ambiguity and chaos in
a market that's already
undergone a lot of challenges.
So one more, and you'll see it's
costing states a ton of money,
and they're not transparent
about that either. So, the idea
that $200 for a product is going
to pay for the multi-million
dollar effort to administrator
administrate just the list alone
because it includes monthly
updates, what's your PMTA
status, and then the states left
to go and find.
all that documentation, some of
which the FDA doesn't release
because a product is still
undergoing marketing approval or
authorization. I just made that
mistake. So we'll get into it.
And I think the vigilation would
help, but that's a great
question. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you.
So, um, I, I will go quickly
through there, yeah, if you,
yeah, she already got it out
there, um, so for just so that
you know that the retailer
permits in New Mexico are given
by the regulation license
department. They can suspend or
revoke a license from a tobacco
retailer who sells to kids that
are underage. There should be an
enforcement provision for the
packaging, packaging law that
you have on the books. I'm not
sure how that's enforced. There
is no true administrative rule,
giving that navigation so the
retail license department can
be.
more effective in explaining how
that works. Um, however, I have
yet to see enforcement
activities based on my
conversation with enforcement
officers in Donana County as to
whether or not they're enforcing
the law that creates a
prohibition on packaging that's
attractive to minors. I will
tell you in our home city of Las
Cruces that you can go into any
vape shop and see all the
Pokemon and the slushy vapes,
and I'm, again, I forgot to
bring them, but it's clearly not
being enforced and we can come
up with ways to do that in a
registry.
is an expensive and overwhelming
and inept impotent way of doing
something like that.
Um, so then the Department of
Public Safety does state
retailer inspections. Samsa is
the federal agency that gives
money your Samsulock treatment
grant, your retailer violation
rate is gauged by the Sinar
report, meaning they go out,
they conduct underage
inspections. If your rate that
fiscal year, meaning over 20,
20% or more of your retailers
sold to underage, um, inspectors
during that time.
You are subject to lose 10% of
your substance abuse block
treatment grant.
Um, that again.
How that would impact, uh, if
you had a registering in place,
uh, that is to remain to be
seen. However, if you're funding
enforcement officers or
administrative officers just to
maintain a list. How are you
funding enforcement officers to
go and conduct the inspections
that are already under funded,
um, and under-resourced just to
conduct your initial sign out
report. Um, and then again, just
I wanted you to see the
different ways that enforcement
is connected.
in New Mexico and how it's
already a bit complicated, which
is in every state, but it's also
unfunded on all levels, um, not
unfunded, excuse me, um,
underfunded and all levels, and
that's coming straight from your
sign our report, um, and the,
um, human health services
department, which is now the
health authority, uh, in that
report it says um explicitly
states that they are
underfunded, they need more
assistance.
Um, I just wanted to, we've
already gone over this. I wanted
to mention that one of your
regulations is the location of a
licensed retailers must be, um,
outside of 300 ft of a school,
um, would result in the vote,
um, unless a city were to adopt
a zoning or other ordinance that
would allow for a greater buffer
distance, however, once again,
that's quite ambiguous. We're
trying to clarify those
provisions. We did that two
years ago, attempted it did not
get a committee hearing, a
second committee hearing,
however, um, again, quite
ambiguous, but there is an
enchant um with the New Mexico
legislature to show that they
like increased regulation on the
point of sale, um, for tobacco
products and hopefully at the
state level with respect to
funds this session. Um, I wanted
to give you an idea if you move
forward, yeah, that we have a
graduated penalty structure. It
follows model policy.
How much it's actually
implemented in terms of if a
retailer is given a citation for
an underage sale, where does
that citation go? Do they know
the protocols? And when you talk
to the retail and licensing
department, at least this was 2
years ago, they said there are
some trouble, there is some
trouble with city and county
attorneys, not knowing how to
adjudicate those signs. So it
would be interesting to know how
they're gathering those fines
and if you have quite a standard
structure and a standard
protocol which registries do
not. This is just your protocol
with respect to underage sales.
And
don't know where those fines are
going or how you will fund of an
enforcement group.
Imagine trying to collect fines
for those products that are off
the market, that are not on the
registry and then attempting to
use that money to enforce an
administrator, administrate that
list. I know I'm probably going
a little too fast, but I wanted
to cover the underage sales
piece and show that even with
what you've got now, with it
all, and it's been multiple
years in a row.
There is still, there are still
challenges and struggles with
both funding.
And ability
Um, what activities are going
for, um, uh, citation, I just
wanted to point you to the, the,
um.
The, the second to last again
Mexico had foresight like this
is you're ready to go with
respect to removing products
that appeal to minors, many of
which are those fluit flavors
have um animated characters or
celebrity endorsements, and yet
that law as it exists right now
is not being enforced.
Um, uh, product detectives,
minors and others definitionally
knowing like Tractor Myers means
packaging or labeling that
contains cartoon-like
characters, imitation of trade
like um Nintendo's game um Game
Boys highlighters, uh, speakers,
if you should be coming up,
symbol of celebrity. So I just
want to give you some of the
ideas of what products. Now,
interesting enough, none of
those products have PMTA
authorization. None of those
products have gone through FDA,
but they've all either been.
Constructed here or imported or
somehow distributed along those
same lines, and they are
flooding the market. Not all of
them are from China.
OK.
Uh, I won't go over the sign up
program too much. We've gone
over this, but I did want you to
see the trends. New Mexico is
hovering above that 20%, about
that 20%, and it can stand to
lose about, um, roughly, this is
from fiscal year 2023, a million
or more, depending on how much
they, they, um, are given each
year.
So last, uh, in 2023, it was
potential loss of over 1
million, and I believe that rate
was 17%. They were almost at
20%. And I, I will say post
COVID challenges, right, a lot
of the FDA inspections shut
down, so they did, they did need
some time to to get back into
the idea of enforcing underage
sales. Um, a couple of problems.
New Mexico does not include
e-cigarettes and cinar
inspections, which are the most
popular products in my kids, you
can imagine that retailers that
use that use cigarettes, um,
that's that's fine.
an inspector or that see a youth
buying traditional combustibles,
that kind of tips them off. I
think you'll you'll see
different rates among those
states that have signed our
inspections that include
e-cigarettes because they are
the most commonly product common
tobacco products using them on
kids.
Um, again, I wanted to leave you
with that quote at the end
there, the state sign it program
has been and continues to be
underfunded, which presents
challenges with complying with
the sign or regulation. All
ready, struggling, and asking
for support. Um, and again, I, I
have sympathy with that
department's not to criticize
that department. Every state
struggles with this.
Um, so, uh, we're gonna, I'm
gonna, if you could just pass
through that preemptive slides.
And we're. So just to give you a
view, thanks, of the 34 FDA
authorized products. I thought a
visual might give you, this is,
um.
Slide, uh, says e-cigarettes
authorized by the FDA.
Uh, it's got a blue title. I
wish I could go.
It is like 27, so it should be
page 27 for you.
Unless you have two slides.
Can you see it?
Is this the one? Yeah.
Right. And I, I just want to
clarify too, so on the October
16th meeting, I covered a lot
more ground, so I'm trying to
get to register my apologies for
the, the sort of discombobulated
nature, but I did want to cover
the red street, especially if
you've been approached. So you
can see the FDA publishes this,
and this is actually of, of, um,
uh, November 17th, that's, these
are the only products that are
approved. So if they really want
to create a list, San Francisco
has done this. Um, they also
have enforcement challenges
among just the retailers within
those districts, they
actually have a list where they
that an ordinance which only
allows those 34 products to be
sold, and even that limited
jurisdiction with the funding
for products that are allowed to
be on that list, have trouble
with enforcing that. So you can
imagine at a statewide or a
federal level, what a registry
would do.
Um, next slide, so e-cigarette
directory registration is a list
of e-cigarettes or vape products
created by the state,
a manufacturer or product that
you get to get on the list. So
in Louisiana, they did not have
enough money for the registry
based on the product fee. So now
they were looking at
manufacturing some manufacturer
submitting a um a fee of $5000
apiece and the manufacturers
were on board with it because
they could not get this registry
implemented with the funding.
from just to to list a product.
This is the key.
A manufacturer must certified
that a pre-market tobacco
product application has been
submitted to the FDA.
Must show that the product has
been granted an MGO remains
under review.
Has a marketing denial and a
court is challenging, meaning
the FDA said no, this is not
eligible for sale in the US.
It's not for um quality does not
qualify for the protection of
public health, it may be
attractive minors. They may have
found some problems with the
manufacturing facility,
facility, the tobacco products
scientific Committee may have
found some product with their
clinical problems with their
clinical reviews, which happens
a lot because they tend to use
data from clinical trials of an
e-product that was done
previously, and so they don't
want people replacing products
like.
like, oh, this e-cigarette looks
and feels like this cigarette.
So we're using studies for the
cigarette. Nope, not, not
acceptable. You're out, but
these registries would say, oh,
there is. We get to decide
because we're going to litigate
that order, and you know, if you
litigate, that's a long time
when a product could remain on
the market. It's actually kind
of egregious cause with the
medicine it would be like, oh,
please allow this medicine to
stay on the market, even though
it's been deemed to cause harm,
so long as we can argue it in
court.
Let it remain on the market.
Um, and then again, the foreign
manufacturer, this is how they
kind of evade the idea that it's
not a racist type of legislation
in that they want you to
identify and most, most states
do this, identify your Secretary
of State as your agent for
service of process in case you
are a foreign manufacturer. But
again, although there are a
number of volume, a high volume
of products that are coming from
foreign foreign uh countries,
uh, a number of products are
right here within the US and
they are not
We undergoing PMT review. And a
lot of times it's very
expensive. So that's why a lot
of these independent vape owners
or um companies do not go
through the PMT process. They
know that's no, there's no
enforcement, so why would they
bother with the PMTA process.
You get a fine, you get a um a
warning letter from the FDA.
Please stop doing this, and you
have a long period of time from
which to adapt and change and
evolve, but your product remains
on the market.
So I did want to go through and
this is gonna take little
clicks. So I know it's gonna be
hard, but we can do this dance.
Um, what it looks like to go
through the pre-MTA process
because this is the detail that
is key and you should, we should
not undervalue the idea of why
the FDA does this and why it's
so important that once the
marketing grinding order is
provided. That is key, not a
denial, not while I'm looking
through the product and making
sure that it's appropriate for
the protection of public health,
but
Only when there's a final order
on the books, and that includes
if I deny a product.
And the industry wants to
litigate.
That product should not be on
the market and tell a court
decides whether or not the FDA
did a thorough evaluation or
based it on the merits of the
application, because one of the
reasons there's this litigation,
and this is just a secondary
piece is FDA has done blanket
marketing orders where they say,
OK, these 3000 we're just going
to deny and the industry
litigated because they'd like
more evidence standard by which
you evaluated their PMTA.
Reasonable, but the product
should not be on the market
until that judicial decision has
been rendered.
Um, so they go through prefile
meetings. Thank you so much. Um,
they go through.
And I already got mine all
through. OK, they go through an
application process in which
that application has to be
accepted, meaning, is it in um
is it legible? Does it have all
the indicated studies? Is it
capable to be filed, meaning, do
you have all your trademarks? Do
you have your clinical studies?
Do you have your manufacturer
manufacturing facility
inspections. So then it can be
filed.
Then it goes through full
review. And once those products
are reviewed, they go through
marketing programs, clinical
studies, and manufacturing
facilities, the tobacco
scientific, the tobacco products
scientific advisory Committee
reviews some of the
pharmacological effects, um, or
physiological effects, they make
recommendations that might
improve the, the file, it can go
back a step, and they can say,
hey, manufacturer, we'd like
more information. Um, they can
get a deficiency letter or they
can make an environmental
request. What's the hazardous
waste? How will you end up
disposing of this product.
Again, another question that's
not been talked about all those
products that are deemed not on
the list, how will the state
confiscate those? How will they
handle them? Local health
departments do not have the
capacity. They're hazardous
waste. The registries don't
speak to that.
That's your burden, not the
manufacturer's burden who's
distributing and selling them in
the US.
Uh, so you can either get a
marketing granting an order or a
marketing denial order. And then
even if you're denied and it
goes to the courts and is
litigated.
You have to wait before that
marketing branded or strive and
if you get an authorization to
market your product.
You still have to report several
years after about marking
tactics, use patterns, any sort
of um adverse events that occur
with that product, and it can be
pulled from the market.
So I just wanted to show you
too, um, this one has a
different categories, so you can
see that um in physically you're
21 to 24 progress. Over 20, 7
million applications were
received. The FDA refused 19
million of those. The next one,
then of those 6 million, almost
6.7 million, 5 million were
rejected.
So you can see it's like I try
to give a good analogy. It
sounds awful, but it's as you
go, if you want a permit to
climb Mount Everest, right? You
have all these steps and there's
hundreds of thousands of people
that apply. They have to get
their permits, they have to show
a certain, um, their passports,
all that, and a number of those
are denied. Then you have to get
the second stage, you got your
base camp, you got to hire
yourself a number of those
people no longer eligible. So
you see that you're constantly,
right, vetting for who is
appropriate to apply, who goes
through the evaluation process,
even before you get to that
evaluation process, liken that
to tobacco product.
So,
of those that make it through
only about 1 million are filed
for review, accepted for review.
The action that's been taken,
um,
Over, uh, over far over 80% of
them are denied and only
currently 34 of those original
27 million products have been.
Authorized for sale in the US.
So you can see it's a high
burden. You have to do a lot of
things to get there, and because
of that, the big 3 are tired of
competing with the little guys
and
For manufacturers, of course,
so.
When we look at
How these registries see what
the registries do is they create
a a loophole so that as long as
you've applied at the filing
stage before you've even gotten
to the postmarket reporting or
to the the granted order. All
those products would be allowed
for sale without any FDA
evaluation. So long as you have
your application in and you have
a form that says, I submitted to
the FDA, you get, but imagine
that for medical school. I
applied for medical school. You
can practice medicine so long as
you applied.
For medical school. But
What we hope is that they go
through the full vetting, they
do their clinical rotations,
they go through medical school,
and then once you're granted a
degree, you can
Practice. Here, no, no, no, no,
no, we just want everyone to be
able to practice and then
hopefully they'll get through
the process.
Think about that in terms of a
registry. So why wouldn't this
be effective because you're
creating a market for thousands,
hundreds of thousands of
products that the AFDA has yet
to even know the name about or
know the name of. It's terrible
grammar, sorry. Um, so I want to
give you an idea of what they
look like. Can you go to the
next one?
This is an Oklahoma vapor
product, and this is an actual
registry, and you can see here
are some of the submissions, the
manufacturer, so it's
inconsistent reports. What is
FDA authorization mean pending?
Does that mean you've submitted
the application, the FDA hasn't
accepted it. Does it mean you've
been granted a marketing order?
Doesn't mean that they've
rejected it or said you have
hazardous waste in this product.
You need to go back and check it
out or go review your
manufacturing facilities. What
does that mean? And then you can
see on the far right.
For enforcement purposes.
Are you able?
To identify those products based
on a, on a written description
if you're an enforcement officer
and you go to a retailer, you
can evaluate which product has
been approved by the FDA or
excuse me, authorized by the FDA
what nicotine content, at what
volume, which mesh coil is
approved for this product versus
that product, and then if you
look, just look at a basic, they
call it the back bar.
In a tobacco retailer and in my
most convenience stores. You
have an enforcement officer. Can
you pick out the products on
that visual, which products?
You cannot.
And so the idea that these
registries are going to solve it
without millions of dollars,
which, by the way, is the 4
states that have adopted 3 have
implemented, still have asked
subsequent funding for upwards
of a million 15, 1500, 1,500,000
for Alabama.
There is not enough money in the
world to help with the
administration of these
registries.
I guess there is, if the tobacco
industry would fund them. But um
you can see, yes, I have here.
I, I just have a question. So
who is pushing for the registry
in New Mexico. Ah, that's a good
question. I have seen, um, from
the petroleum Marketers
Association, some op-eds in
surrounding states, but and they
the Altria lobbyists in the
majority of states in my western
region, and I have 22 regions is
always the lead. So, um, that is
the one and and generally, um,
they pursue it as a public
health.
Solution. Thank you, thank you,
that is the case.
So that is the case in New
Mexico as well. Yeah.
And to be fair, they're, they're
not, they're not hiding it and
legislators aren't hiding it,
and they have them testify as
expert witnesses right by them
about the registers. So, um,
I just want to give you, and so
Kansas wasn't the first. I
appreciate though that it shows
me that actually that some of it
was valuable, um, cause I, I
like the detail, but Kansas
wasn't necessarily the first,
um, because Oklahoma, Louisiana,
um, Alabama and now Wisconsin,
Wisconsin has delayed
implementation to see how others
are, are improving theirs, but
in 2023 to 2024, Kansas had
introduced legislation
introduced and what was
wonderful is the Department of
Revenue had a representative
come
and testify and gave amazing
testimony about the cost, um, so
I just wanted to point out just
two provisions in that you can
see product fees, which they
tell you this is how it's gonna
work. The pro the estimate of
the product fees to implement
this, uh, registry was about
5750. And then if you click
again, you can see what they
thought would take from the
state general fund was over a
half a million dollars, and to
be fair, evidence has proven
that.
out in all states that actually
have a registry at the moment
that have actually implemented
um a specific piece of
legislation to create the list
and simply creating this loan
and then vetting it with the,
the federal government has been
the major challenge, but also
the idea that
It's very simple if you only
create a list of those that have
authorization for sale in the
US.
Um, I did want to point out that
one of the tactics that they're
using is not only op eds from
advocates, but they're producing
these charts, um, and it, it's
directly from Altria and I went
to the Food and Drug Law
Institute, um, conference and
discuss and saw them discuss on
the panel about how effective
the Louisiana vapor market, the
vapor registry, but they failed
to tell you is that it's based
on their marketing um reports as
well as the Louisiana E Vapor
registry was also passed along
with a very, very high.
attacks on e-cigarettes and
independent vape shop owners
opposed filed suit against the
registry, but not necessarily
based on the list, based on the
discriminatory or like they
would say it in um
In equitable application of the
law for the big 3 versus
independent manufacturers. Now,
31 and they're still claiming
quite a reduction in the number
of legal products for market um
in Louisiana but Department of
Robber 2 and the Department of
Revenue, um, still has yet to
report those similar facts. So,
um, my partners at TFK, um, our
organization and the tobacco
liquorsortium are still trying
to find where this data um is
coming from because we certainly
hasn't confiscated hundreds of
thousands of products and
dispose of them and then find.
A survey of the number of legal
products still allowed on the
market. The other key piece of
um registry legislation, um, and
we'll go, we'll go to the next
one and I wanted um to tell you
about is, they're starting to
chase their own tail, and that a
lot of these nicotine pouches,
including sand, are they tobacco
products in the definition of
state law.
So one thing that they would
like to do is to lower the tax
on certain products, but if you
lower the tax on a specific
product, how do you do that? You
have to re-categorize them.
You have to re-categorize that
product as separate from
traditional tobacco.
So does that product now
qualified to be sold on
The directory. So now you have
this sort of, right, evolution
of
Is a product considered a
tobacco product for the purposes
of tax, but not considered
tobacco product the registry.
And so it's a continuous way of
reducing regulation and removing
products from the definition of
tobacco or tobacco product. In
many states have variable
definitions, but it's also just
makes it another way, chaos and
ambiguity on what products are
legal for sale and which ones
aren't and how we be enforced.
So I wanted to show you some of
the um op eds that come out,
they're usually from either a
past or present legislator, um,
a petroleum marketers
association.
The group has also um funded
quite a bit of op-eds from other
states, and a lot of them have
to do with this, um,
Uh, avoiding illegal products
from the Chinese market and as I
stated before, a number of
products are not from China, um,
and a lot of our tech gadgets
are made from product um from
parts from China, so it's not,
it's not as though only creating
a list that doesn't include
imported products would affect
your weight control over all the
products in the market today.
This one from Arizona was
extremely, to me was one of the
most egregious because it
clearly shows an intent to
demonize China, um, and show the
credit preying on.
American children. Interesting
enough, you can't find when you
go to that site stop Chinese
babes, who's funding it, what
group um industry is working
with them, um, and now it's no
longer up um so this is
happening in a number of states,
a number of news bulletins.
Newspapers, um, and news
mediums, uh.
And then this one from Nevada.
Nevada is expecting a registry
as well. We talked to the AG
there as well. Um, so I want to
give you an idea too if you move
to the next slide, you can see,
um, it's kind of an onslaught at
this point. A number of states,
um, in uh 2023, 24 saw the
introduction of registry
legislation, um, um, in the
existing ones, it was Louisiana,
Alabama, Oklahoma all saw
subsequent legislation to
increase appropriations to that
state.
And that's how you, Oklahoma is
one of my states and they have a
wonderful group called TSet
Tobacco Settlement Endowment or
um A, which is similar to um to
tobacco, um, which is similar to
what you do with the MSA funds.
And hopefully they'll get some
chilis.
But they have a registry that
was underfunded. And the new
legislation that was meant to
appropriate more funds to enter
to implement the Oklahoma
registry failed.
So they now are taking some of
the TSA funds from the MSA.
And giving it to enforcement
officers to be and it was
something like $54,000 but
still, the MSA money that was
meant.
To protect and go to public
health services and effectuate
better tobacco control is now
being used to enforce market
share for the big 3 that have
their products on that list.
Uh, so I just wanted to see that
you can see how it's the erosion
of existing programs, and we
fought hard in New Mexico to
retain. You would let that
Senator Hickey to retain those
funds and not have that fund
continually rated. That's 3
legislative sessions, probably
even more before my arrival with
this organization.
You can imagine what's gonna
happen when it's registered
passed. You have a mandate to
fund it.
Where's that money coming from?
And you have to get those
manufacturers to pay those fees,
and you have to have someone to
watch those things, but you also
have to have someone to be able
to vet all of that application
process, some of which stage 2
to 5 years. So even the FDA has
trouble with all the experts
getting those applications
added. Now it's your job with
somebody at NewAC or possibly
Department of Health to evaluate
all that PMTA stuff, and that's
only for those that actually
submit.
So it's passed in 7 states.
Not great. Uh, and I just wanted
to make you aware too that in
Utah, um,
Remember, Utah, Florida, and
Colorado all have evolved to
different entities in Colorado
immediately vetted.
And once they found out the true
nature of the registries, talk
to the AG there and now they
made underage um sales, meaning
a product that is considered
illegal for sale to a minor
under the Consumer Protection
Act can actually create an
individual claim. So not only do
you get fines based on the
state's T21 law, you can get
fines for selling a product in
the Consumer Protection Act. So
whether or not that actually
effectuates better change, it
may bring better compliance
because retailers may be worried
that they're gonna be 21.
Um, and I feel for the states
that have this is not criticism
of Oklahoma, Louisiana, Alabama.
They are doing their best to do
what the legislator legislature
demanded of them, and in
Wyoming, interestingly enough,
Um, it looked, the initial
legislation looked like a
tobacco retail license where you
could find retailers in a
graduated process and revoke a
license if they continue
disapproval authorization, and
yet no the tobacco industry did
not want that type of
legislation, and they just found
$300,000 from the appropriations
committee to fund the registry.
Thank goodness it failed, but it
is interesting that the tobacco
industry is looking for states
to fund implementation of a
registry that would protect
their market share because they
are
The only ones that can afford
authorization processes.
Almost done.
You can go to the FDA site,
there's a searchable tobacco
products database that can
include any product you can type
in any product, including sin,
which is not approved or
authorized for sale in the US
has yet to be.
Um, so all of those pouches.
Not legal for sale in the US.
The problem is enforcement. And
so you can see I also wanted to
give you an idea of what the FDA
has done to help effectuate
better enforcement against
illegal products, they've
created this joint task force,
the first of its kind involving
the US Marshals Service. They
created several confiscation and
seizures, um, very high profile,
however, it is a drop in the
bucket when you consider the
amount of but it is an effort,
and we're hoping that it
continues with the elections
that may change. However, um,
it's a continuous.
Advocacy recommendations. I did
want to make note of um that
cigarette manufacturer directory
is created for MSA purposes
basically are for tax purposes,
right, and whether or not you
pay into the master settlement
agreement. So sometimes you'll
hear that in testimony or the
industry lobbyists will say, oh,
we already have a cigarette
manufacturer directory, not the
same thing. That is solely for
purposes of who has to pay into
the master settlement.
The nonpartisanal settlement as
well as you'll hear about
California's legislation,
totally separate as well. That's
an unflavored tobacco list in
response to their flavored
tobacco prohibition, which is a
state law.
Because they were having so much
trouble enforcing with
compliance, they adopted a new
law last year that requires
manufacturers to prove that
their product is not flavored to
get on a list, so then retailers
know what they can sell, not a
registry, but again, conflating
those issues, they are not the
same thing. They are not
e-cigarette directories or
product um product registries.
Um, I just want to let you know
about the registry bills, um,
are not a substitute for G21
enforcement, if you have a good
TRL this could be part of that.
You don't
like those products that are
being marketed to kids in your
underage inspections, you can um
excuse me, raise the number and
you can look and do the same
enforcement at the same time you
do your underage inspection and
you can inspect for those
products that have packaging
attractive to to kids. I know
it's not that simple, but I'm
saying is that you can also um.
Combined efforts if this lots
are being used to circumvent the
ADADA office, and yes, the FDA
process is slow, it's
cumbersome, but this is the way
it works, and right now this is
what we have. So New Mexico
would be challenged for
challenging federal law and
saying that they now get up and
it opens the market with
expense, and I will say,
The group that killed it in
Arizona or the Independent uh
lobby Associations because they
knew that the number of them,
uh, that a number of them would
not be able to go through that
PNT process. And what's funny is
their argument is, we're already
selling products that are not
legal for sale. Why would you
stop us by creating a list that
makes it very aware, um.
A few other things is it, I
covered that in the emerging
products again they'll see
tobacco products that are heat,
not burn, you're trying to
re-categorize them, you're gonna
see that and this legislature
just keep us on your radar when
you can. I promise I won't be as
long, um, but I think the
details are important
specifically for registered
registration uh legislation, and
I'll stop there unless you have
specific questions. Um, and
again, my, my, my presentation
was much longer and the previous
meeting because we covered all.
Thank you very much, um.
As I said, not one in. I have a
much better understanding. Thank
you very much. I will go to the
uh
Committee for questions and
we'll start with Representative
Thompson.
Thank you so much for your
presentation. So, um, I mean as
scripts and a Ferrari just said
to me, damn, if you do, damned
if you don't, essentially.
So
What a bill to give RLD and the
AG or whoever, um, more power to
oversee.
I mean, is there something we
could do as a state?
To kind of not pass this for
sure, but then to kind of
counteract.
What, what's currently
happening.
Yes, um, a number of
organizations have
recommendations. Um, one of the
things that I've seen in other
states is when you have local
authorities with the ability to
enforce, meaning you grant local
um cities, you see greater
compliance because the state
can't be everywhere or fund
everyone. And if you have a
local tobacco retail licensing
program or something equivalent
in Nevada, they're preempted in
Oklahoma, they're preempted, and
yet they have novel ways of
allowing localities to assist in
enforcement where they either
get.
Grant funding or they're allowed
to collect retailer fees, and
that goes directly to the state.
The state then gives them money
to enforce, so there are a
number of provisions. My
organization, of course, would
love to see you clarify
preemption so that cities can
just move forward, adopt their
tobacco retail licensing
programs. They can help with
both density and tobacco
disparities because the greater
the use earlier onsetation.
Grant funding or they're allowed

The state then gives them money

organization, of course, would
love to see you clarify

tobacco retail licensing
programs. They can help with
both density and tobacco
disparities because the greater
the use earlier onset of
education. So preemption
clarification is one, even
without parental clarification
because I realize that's a big
ball of wax is enforcement and
funding. However, we have talked
to the.
I went to the National
Association of AGs meetings and
um I was very open to those
discussions. Do we need with the
AG's office. He's very aware of
registry legislation. I think
she might also have some good
recommendations. Um, but yes,
they're all alternatives. And
what I do think is interesting
is that when you see good
legislate that's terrible when
you see public health advocate
legislators, looking at this
registry legislation, and they
look at TRL licensing.
This chance to adopt the same
structure where you pay a fee,
you that fee goes into where you
can be revoked. There's a
graduated penalty structure and
the minute.
That is discussed in committee
that provision is removed and
funding is is generated
elsewhere. So I do think that
that's something to watch out
for is why are they so afraid?
Of tobacco retail licensing. Why
are they so concerned about the
possibility of losing their
license based on illicit product
or underage sales. It's cheaper,
it's more efficient.
And it's more effective.
So I do think that there's,
there's something to be said
about having an open forum about
their motives and their
evidence.
Thank you for that and then um
I'm kind of confused that, but.
I mean, I know getting the PMTA
makes you legal, but from an FDA
standpoint, doesn't guarantee
safety? Does it, I know. So it
basically it's just, I mean,
what does it involve to get
that?
You had the little chart, but
what do you have to prove? OK,
so there are a number of things,
um, and again, a lot of it is
technical, but there are
clinical studies in terms of
use, um, some of them, a lot of
them have to do whether
traditional tobacco, depending
on the product that you're
trying to prove traditional
combustible use either those
consumers were more likely to
switch or to consume less.
Or if those products were likely
to be used by new users, right?
That you were going to attract
new nicotine or tobacco users,
and they have a number of
definitions. I'm happy to put
together just like a one pager
about that process and send it
to you because there are a lot
of technicalities, they have to
prove their manufacturing
facilities abide by certain
regulations in terms of safety,
as well as just worker safety,
but the product safety, right,
that they go through undergo
safety inspections or chemicals
manufacturing probably the
hazardous materials. They
also have to go through
marketing studies they have to
have demo, they have to show.
Right that these marketing
studies have been targeted at
any specific type of vulnerable
group like kids, um, and again,
I, I don't want to speak out of
turn because I, I, they are very
technical terms and trying to
give it a general overview, but
there is a reason those
Those processes are in place,
and mainly it's to make sure
that you're not creating a more
addictive product or more
dangerous product at least, but
particularly products are
attractive to new users under
the age, I'm guessing 21. They
don't, they say youth and young
adults.
Seems like that would be hard to
prove or disprove. I totally
agree, um, and that's why that
process is, is quite um
rigorous, uh, because of what
happened previously and the, uh,
with respect to the combustible
tobacco market and having been
marketed as healthy alternatives
or non-addictive, they stood up
in Congress and testified
nicotine is not addictive. And I
did have a um uh a
representative, excuse me, a
lobbyist in Arizona, we were
talking about the specific and
they.
directly asked him, do you, so
you're still dealing with this
kind of mentality. I'm not
holding everybody accountable to
that, but that is what
legislators are here. So, so
essentially license.
doesn't mean anything in terms
of safety.
Uh, no, I mean the, the marking
granted order means nothing. So
the license is a retailer, OK,
so it would be like a brick and
mortar or a convenience stores.
They have to have a tobacco
retail license tobacco FDA gives
you a granted order that says
you're, you're allowed, you're
given permission to sell this
product, even though it might
not, you know, I, I can't, I'm
not gonna work out because it
makes me sound like I'm just
making false claims. But this
product is appropriate for the
protection of public health with
respect to all sorts of
standards, one including that
it's not attractive.
To you. Yes, many people, many
are public health organizations
disagree with that standard, but
that is the standard, uh, I
mean, among others, by which
they tell the NGO why that
marketing granted order is so
necessary.
It's, it's just kind of funny
that they have to prove that
it's not
when everyone knows it's
harmless and like upside down
world, but so just out of
curiosity, um,
the big 3 do a lot of clinical
studies and amazingly they
usually come out in their favor.
So it's the FDA.
Actually
Um, demanding.
Nonpartisan, non non whatever um
research to to
I think that you, yes, they,
they use um quite a lot of,
they, they use several studies,
not just those that have been
because what they can do is and
then they can counter some of
that research well here's a
similar product or here's some
similar, um, uh, results, but I
do think that those, it's sort
of like a peer review process in
which they peer review the
research, and if it's not up to
par, if it hasn't met certain
standards under peer review
research or the FDA authority,
then it's thrown back or they
get a marketing denial or this
is not sufficient.
Um, so again, I have not worked
with you, but there are a number
of now,
not just attorneys, but medical
officers. That
Then leaving the FDA because
that process is so rigorous and
some of those regulations are
difficult to follow. However, it
is the process we have in
You know, currently, and that
is, I mean, the standard is the
FDA regulates those products and
if, if there is a better way, I
would love to see how they
expect states to evaluate those
same products under new revised
or existing FDA guideline.
That's just
And one of the reasons they have
that is because they have the
full force of the federal
government, National Institutes
of Health, CDC to help
supplement that research, um,
and look at unbiased research,
because the number that then and
it's, it's out there, you can
look it up online. Yes industry
funded research station advice.
They are not, no e-cigarette has
ever been authorized or approved
as a cessation device, um, so
the idea that somehow this would
help alleviate the problem of
those smokers trying to quit is
just, you know.
So again in,
in upside down world. There's a
rigorous process, Mr. Chair.
To prove a falsity.
That, that nicotine products are
not.
Addictive or dangerous or
healthy or whatever. So yeah, so
just to be clear, because that
would be approved, that would
mean like a treatment diagnosis.
So the FDA process evaluates the
product and one of the best
standards is appropriate for the
protection of public health,
meaning that it's no longer
attractive to minors, but it's
not intended for use by minors.
So I just want to be clear that
they do not say it's healthy.
They do not, they do not go to
safety and efficacy of the
product used as intended.
So, and
The other piece of that, um, is
that
One of the problems that has
created this chaos is lack of
FDA enforcement because they
used the terms we are
prioritizing enforcement against
those products that do not have
a PMG in the process and this
was with the advent of
the rats in 2016 when it kind of
blew up.
However,
They failed to
Reps failed to continue with
that paragraph and read the
whole thing and it says,
Even so, any product without FDA
authorization is subject to
enforcement. So there's this
sort of like caveat that these
industry reps are safe. Our
products are safe. You see what
happened with Joel that did not
go through the PMG process, and
now you're having states having
to litigate spend their own
money.
To backfill all the problems
that schools are having, and a
lot of that joint settlement
funding one of those states is
not going.
tobacco cessation research,
education, it goes through a
general for, it goes to state
roads in North Dakota, um, and
it's not sufficient really to go
to reverse the trend that has
now cigarette epidemic, although
we do see some, some wins, some
gains with respect to lower you
percentage percentage of use of
these products over time, there
are still millions of kids that
use it, schools are still having
to submit their own litigation
number.
Districts against Jew to get
money. So the idea that we're
safe and sound, just because you
use rates have been reported to
go down, does not mean that this
isn't gonna start a new trend.
One second uh Representative
Jay, uh, would you like to
introduce yourself? Thank you
for joining the committee.
OK. Um, so I'm so sorry I didn't
make it from the beginning of
your.
Um, presentation and but I did
know it was going to be late
today I G Jy, my district is in
Albuquerque.
Um, I have an area that includes
the University of New Mexico's
main campus. Thank you. Good to
be here. Thank you, Senator.
Representative I think that's
all of my questions for, I mean,
it's, it's.
You wouldn't tear your hair out
and scream into the wind and
everything else cause the big
three are always.
light years ahead of us and
It's sad. Thank you. Thank you,
Mr. Chair. Thank you.
and for
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank
you, Megan. Um, you always are
wealth of information.
Reliable scientific research
based and we appreciate it. Um
I should note this, but um you
know um how much money or what
we spent our jewel money on.
I know we got, we've gotten
reports on that.
No, I don't recall that we have
gotten that report and this not
in this.
Yeah, could you, could you see
it where that report is.
And send it out to the committee
members.
That senator, we, we have SAG
about the description of those
funds previously, the, the
group, the national partners or
coalition partners, um, so not
that we haven't looked into it.
It's just it, it's not.
I, I
So, Mr. Jeremy, um, that's
something that we need to make
sure is going to our community
for enforcement, um, and you
earlier mentioned about some of
the AGs uh across the country
were sending letters to um
Uh
Procedure?
Can you explain more about that?
Yes, thank you.
the
Um, so,
In light of this introduced uh
registry legislation across the
board. The AGs and states that
do not seek registry
legislation. And again,
That's all preface that it could
be just a simple response to the
idea that they're tired, the
number of volume, uh, the volume
of illicit products that are on
the market, so the AGs who are
in charge of enforcing retail
licensure, meaning point of
sale. They have sent letters to
all of the tobacco retailers
either have a license or tax
permit because Arizona does not
have a job put them on notice
that you are
Responsible for this sale of
legal products in the US and we
will be enforcing against all
products that have yet to be
seen.
FDA authorization. I'm happy to
send you those letters as well.
Um, but this is kind of a
pushback in that.
If we're going to keep
continuing to address the idea
that there's an illegal market,
you're responsible for making
sure those products are not on
your shelf, and we're gonna come
after you if you do. So whether
or not they've actually taken
action since those letters have
been sent. Many of them are
worried about their signar as
well, because their sign our
rates get variable and those
products that are illegal for
sale are generally the most
popular among youth.
And so they know that they can
kind of get two birds with one
stone, Mr. Cha and Megan, um.
Uh, I don't know that we've
asked our attorney General to do
that.
I, I don't know either. Um, I do
know he was very receptive and
um.
Do the
AG's office to discuss, so they
are aware of this and um they
are also aware, and again these
are ongoing meetings just for
informative purposes. There's
no, you know, it's just a
national partners are doing,
whether they're looking at
Rossinos or looking at
registries or looking at tax
legislation, they'd like to have
open conversations about what
the department is looking at.
Um, they're all well aware, and
I think they were receptive to
the idea of localities being
able to have the authority to
enforce, whether it's underage
sales, commercial marketing, or
I do think that there's an
avenue for you though, when
you've already adopted the the
legislation with respect to the
packaging because for the most
part,
The
Beijing is also is key. Now a
number of organizations like uh
Jewel or Puff, they just simply
change the packaging to be
colors, right? Like, so instead
of pink cherry, it's a pink
cover and they think that that
would allow them legal authority
to to market. However,
Under the state law.
You can make sure that that law
is enforced through
administrative rules and however
way you want.
So the idea that you could be
enforcing against these illegal
products.
That tend to be the products
with the illegal packaging to
find under state law.
You're already a step ahead
there.
You just need
The legs to get those products
removed from the, the shelves.
Now they will adapt. They always
do. They'll they'll figure a way
to package those products so it
complies with your law, but at
least you have a chair and thank
you, Megan. Um, and
Another thing is, um, it goes
along with that I think is
clarifying of the preemption so
that we can
Take the funding
But from the jewel money to
expand.
Grants to local enforcement.
So, that's, so two separate
things, but yes, that's my term.
Thank you, uh, sure, uh.
So, clarifying preemption.
It would allow separate from
jewel money.
If you were to clarify and, and
it may be that that localities
already have the authority. One
of the problems is that they are
reluctant to adopt licensing
programs at the local level,
meaning they issue licenses to
retailers in their jurisdiction,
they get a fee that fee is used
to fund inspection so that they
can look at whether they have a
list of products or they're
selling to minors, and that
That violation go against their
license. The license can be
revoked if they have so many
violations. That's separate
because as the tobacco products
Act um stands now, it's not
clear what cities can do. So as
long as the as the cities are
consistent.
With the tobacco Products Act.
What does that mean? Can they
raise the minimum of sales age?
Well, yeah, because the minimum
legal sales agent the Tobacco
Products Act is 21.
Can they
enforce the tobacco retail
license. I'm not sure, so like
It can clarifying that piece,
localities can adopt.
Local licensing or enforcement
protocols that could tackle both
issues.
Separately.
money or how whatever grant you
want.
The estates that have
preemption, say we're complete
preemption.
They can give cities money to
conduct enforcement activities
that the state already does with
respect to the state tobacco
retail license. So they may not
be able to implement their own
license or they may, depending
on what legislation or
administrative rules you enact.
That money goes to those local
cities to have an enforcement
officer in that city, effectuate
enforcement against both
underage sales.
And illegal products. You get to
decide, you get one, the other,
or both.
And then, when you think about
it, it's like having, I hate to
say armies, but it's having
little minions in every city, as
opposed to having a state say,
OK, now we have foreign
enforcement officers, they
conduct all the inspections for
underage sales. Go conduct
inspections for all the tobacco
retailers in the state.
Now you have ing in every city
that seeks to adopt that program
and use funding that can help
with enforcement, and what we
see is non-preempted states who
let cities adopt enforcement
programs.
Have better compliance rates
that are sign our rates, lower
youth use rates, those states
that are preempted that have to
do it on their own.
Very difficult.
More challenges.
So, I think those are two
separate great question because
it is, it's, but there is a way
to settle it. If this doesn't
work and you
You can't get through that
preemption clarification because
I'm gonna move forward with
local cities and encourage them
to adopt and see what that
threshold is, because in most
cases, cities can do things, but
you'll have something you're a
little worried about.
But then you could be working on
this side and saying, hey, we
have money for enforcement
activities we'd like the AG or
the licensing and um I'm sorry
licensing regulation department,
um, we'd like to assist them and
we're gonna give.
You spread the wealth and you
spread the burden.
It's not so simple, but we do
have a lot of allies in public
health around that are working
well willing to help.
Exactly and um
Yeah, that's um
The the funding and the ability
to enforce is going to be, I
think, really important.
And working with our attorney
general, I'm glad he is, um,
also continuing conversations
with
OH and how this could work
through them too.
Thank you.
Representative Jason.
Mister chair and, and thank you
again. I was looking up your
organization, uh, because I
missed the first part of the
presentation and I was wanting
to try to bring myself up to
speed.
But I got kind of interested in
the map that's on the website
that grades the states.
For their implementation of
tobacco 21, we've got an app,
yes, I'm just wondering, have
you told this committee why we
have an F?
So we met 2 years ago,
um.
But the problems is that
preemption piece. Um, the, the
preemption piece in which it's
not clear what cities, whether
they have the authority to, uh,
affect your weight local
enforcement. Um, it's also
At the time that grade was made,
there wasn't even a date, so you
had a state law on the books
that required a tobacco retail
license, which retailers were
getting licenses and very, um, I
would say very confident and um
open uh departmental uh
representatives we're able to
share information about the
difficulties and challenges of
not only just identifying the
number of retailers in the
state, but it was implemented to
post COVID. So during COVID, you
try to find those retailers to
conduct any type of.
inspection. Um, also the
administrative, um, the protocol
in terms of license suspender is
looking at the number of
licenses that have actually been
issued versus the number of
licenses that have been
suspended, um, and what that
adjudicative process is not very
clear. So all of that goes into
the grading process. And um I, I
live here.
So my hope is to get my estates,
Greg, up, um, we were able to
get Kansas up and um Arizona,
um, even though they don't have
a tobacco retail license, um,
but, uh, there are various
factors and I'm happy to share
that that with you as well.
Uh, thank you so much. Um, I
remember the days back when the
MSA was just when we were first
preparing to receive the
funding, and we had a very, very
hard time getting the
legislature's attention to um
The, the level of enforcement we
had to demonstrate.
And because
You know, I'm trying to think
back about the lobbyists who
were
Um
challenging.
With whom to deal at that time,
and it seemed that they weren't
so much the big 4.
But the um
They represented.
Maybe later became participating
in manufacturers. Um,
It was just really hard.
To get the um
The house tax committee anyway
too.
Say, oh yes, we have to do this,
but um actually those things
that make a preemption clear, we
have preemption for a lot of our
state laws, or, you know.
We have
Definite provisions that
This can't be preempted at this
at the local level.
And uh it seems like this might
not be too bad a cure for at
least uh
Something that that's
accomplishable in the future.
Thank you.
OK
Presentative, I'm sorry,
senator.
Mr. Chair, thank you just a
couple of comments and kind of
did with what Representative
Chasey was sharing, um.
You remember
the challenges that were
Um, run of the legislature at
that time.
And we still have challenges.
A different, from a different
perspective.
But um the whole show and
preemption.
That's another conversation for
us to.
And I do.
I do believe that.
Well, I'm always hopeful. Yeah.
We need to move and strengthen.
And I think just offered the
opportunity.
To me.
To make up their own, especially
our children.
So that the axis is very.
So
Which is not like.
Uh
Again, thank you for
download, um,
the
If I were to have a a couple of
takeaway points.
With all the complexity in the
law.
Where, where do you get the
biggest bang for the buck, and
um what I'm hearing today is
that potentially the biggest
bang for the buck.
Given all these other
complexities is.
One
Now
Following down some other states
in this registration law. I mean
it's just, there's, there's not
a benefit in fact it's.
confusion, and it takes money
away from where I'm hearing you
say, particularly of the
Attorney general getting
interested in this is working
with the Attorney general and
the Department of Licensing and
regulation, you get a much more
robust and um that may do more
than anything else we know
raising the price, which is what
I'm gonna ask the next speaker
two.
Talk about a little bit, uh.
Um
And uh
Um
But I, I think we have a much
better understanding of the
registration process, and that
was what I was hoping that you
would provide for us. Thank you
for driving up here.
And, uh, and continuing your
work.
So
Well
We'll take it from here, we
don't have any other further.
Meetings for this year, but that
doesn't stop us in looking at
maybe some way.
leverage and preemption piece
once again, although we know
where it gets stuck.
Um
Where's that?
Yes.
Judiciary.
And yeah and um yeah.
because it opens a can of worms
is is uh.
is the idea, but still looking
at that and then also looking at
What it can do around the
Enforcement area in doing it
with those two entities I just
mentioned, and then we'll hear a
little bit about tax and then
we'll hear briefly on what we
are, what, what stage we're at
in a new pack being able to
become fully functional with
the. So thank you again. Thank
you.
Excuse me
I request a copy of the letter
that the other AGs have sent for
sure, yes, I, I'll send that to
you. Yeah, if you could send it
to, you can send it out.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
OK, next I would like to call
up.
Ma
Sita and Linda Siegel.
Thank you. And
Um, we're not looking so much
for a formal presentation, but
from your perspective.
Where do you see?
Under the concept that the more
expensive the product for use.
The less uptake by you, we, we
did get information earlier this
year that
Bathing and bathrooms is now
detectable. Um, so, there's been
a phenomenal switch in young
people over to the pouches.
Um
And
had to your organization's head.
perspectives and what we might
do to
Lessen the use of the pouches,
the uptake of nicotine, and in
general.
Is there a role
To be played for attacks and
that, and what would that look
like?
Mr. Chairman
I think our, our position is
very clear.
Research and
studies that
If we want to
taxes on tobacco
It has to be
Across the board
Because
Just raising
Taxes.
e-cigarettes.
You know,
There's a studies that have
shown that, you know, people
will
Switch back to combustibles.
That
that
You know
Some of the
e-cigarettes. So, I mean,
That's a big concern.
So if we just raise taxes on
e-cigarettes just.
Address the issue of
You know,
the.
I think that
Concern is, you know, maybe.
Pushing some of those kids.
To combustible.
Yeah
So
All our position.
It's like raising.
across the board.
And
Raising
You know, combustible cigarettes
and also bringing
cigarettes on par.
With those, so that way like you
know.
And pouches, yes.
delivery systems, cultures and
and
synthetic nicotine products,
they are not.
tobacco products in our
You know
Macro Control Act.
I think we tried to change that.
And
products are already
are not being taxed.
As tobacco products.
Or
To
Include
these products.
You know, synthetic
Otherwise
as tobacco products.
Because there are nicotine
products.
And tax them as such.
And
Revenue can be

You know, prevention and
education and schools and like.
As Megan was talking about.
You know,
Some of that money for
Helping cities and counties are
of course very good.
Thanks Linda Seal for an
American Cancer Society Cancer
Action Network and that's,
that's pretty much the agreement
of all the national
organizations is that we try to
have all tobacco products that
are comparable price level.
So that there's not switching
back and forth to find the
cheaper product.
And of course, we've, we've
tried to add the languages
synthetic products to um the
statute, and we
And we need to do that so that
we
That we, um,
Make sure that we've covered
everything, any kind of
synthetic tobacco.
grown tobacco is covered by um
statue with the
Equitable, um, even tax or
comparable tax.
Very good.
Um, and you have come up with
some potential model
legislation, I believe, am I
correct in that or incorrect?
I, I understand the concept. Mr.
Chair, we always have.
Of the graph, the chairman, and
then, you know, on, on, on the
subject of, you know, tobacco,
you know.
Other tobacco products.
No
Yeah, I mean, uh
On, on, on the legislation.
I think
Last year we did
Thank you all for
guessing that
You know,
OK

Uh, one of our, you know,
Recommendations, uh.

You know,
To a
that
Legislation to say.
You know, at least, you know.
So sunset.

You know
This

Solely

sunset and you can
Study the issue how.

The rates are going down.
Because right now that money.
just
You know
So we're
I don'
Ever gets to.
What
So I think that that's something
you know.
We
consideration because
Legislature doesn't like to.
Earmark
funds, but at least if we can
put a sunset on this.
Maybe that
3 years and 5 years and see if
how well.
uh questions from the committee.
Um, thank you, Mr. Chair.
So we're talking and trying to
do um increase all nicotine
products.
Um, we don't have to, um,
Say that nicotine products and
raise that to.
Uh, tobacco.
Uh, level.
Is that right?
Or
is like, you know, raising all
that.
say for example, you
Cigarette tax $1.
And then
E.
You know, taxes and other.
product
Include them into the tobacco.
acting as such, so all those
products will be also.
You
On.
So, um, Mr. Chair and we're not
talking about raising tobacco.
Um, taxes that we have already
$2 a pack.
to raise all the other nicotine
products.
since, you know, we

You know, kids or
e-cigarettes to combat.
s
So in order
like that, you know
cigarette taxes and rain.
taxes on raising.
Oh
Because I mean the the studies
were doneless couple of.
he said, look, we should raise
it.
But they're like
You know, studies that conducted

states that we
Cheaper
to the combustible, so.
Cigarette smoking rates have
gone down considerably.
10 years. I think it's right now
it's about.
4 or 5%.
So we want to go down
But
Like
is by raising just e-cigarette
taxes. You may see an increase
in combustible rates like
smoking cigarettes.
So even though Mr. Chair and
Even though they're
considered high. We need to have
them higher.
Right.
You know, that's weird and then
bring it, OK, I got it. I just
wanted to make sure, um.
Thank you. And
I
I think making sure that we have
the funding.
Uh, going to the appropriate and
Um
Would we
Like we were considering, but I
don't think we're going to do
anymore sunset or alcohol excise
tax, if you
reach a certain level that your
sunset.
You're saying no sunset or you
are saying we should sunset it.
Um
But if we reach a certain level
of non
Smoking or non-vaping.
Given the history of the
legislature, not to earmarking.
Tax revenue
program.
You know, given
problems we have.

So we're suggesting at least,
you know, try it for 5 years or
3 years.
And your
That money exclusively

Maybe
I
cities are are the.
No
For
can study that issue at least.
35 years and see how it goes,
and if the legislature feels
that.
You know, this is a good
solution. It's working.
And
Uh
You guys explain some other
revenues to offset that.
You know
That
We will have like something.
solution, it's working on.
Right now we're not doing any of
this.
So some is better than none.
But then we have to risk whether
or not.
Yeah
have to fight it again, um.
But there might be a change, but
a lot of new legislators, um,
Or
More open idea that, you know,
something that is a tax going
toward, you know, reducing the
harms, um, would be OK.
And to keep that going instead
of.
Having it drop off, so we would
love to get all that money
towards tobacco prevention,
education, every, every penny of
it.
But
is, uh, you know.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr.
Represented Thompson. Thank you,
Mr. Chair. Thank you, Linda.
So this
Out there, so.
We, we do, we do, you know,
cigars and
Chewing tobacco and cigarettes.
Is there ever been any talk
about
ing based on how much nicotine,
you know, those really, really
tough high nicotine products
being taxed at a higher level
than
And some of it is that even, is
that crazy?
Mr. Chair Representative
Thompson, I think it's a great
idea, but it's probably
impossible because we don't
know.
How much nicotine is in many of
these products, uh, and to find
that out.
I doubt that we would, it would
take, you know, mandating
corporate.
Entities to tell us what's in
their product and
you know,
No
So just kind of it's a federal.
And a lot of
I
OK.
And then, um, my second
question.
And I'm afraid I know the
answer, but um.
I'm hopeful.
So
Tobacco is always ahead of us. I
mean they in turn every time we
change uh uh definition, they
Tweak their formula so that it
doesn't fit.
Is there anyone who's come up
with the definition that would
include all current and
hopefully future products so
that we that we don't keep
leaving these big gaping holes
for them to run through, you
know, we think we've caught
everything, but then there, you
know, then it's not called this
anymore.
could not got this ingredient or
so is, is there anything
nationally going on in terms of
trying to come up with a
definition that, well, if not,
get us ahead of the big tobacco,
at least on a somewhat level
playing field, no.
Um, I think that we could tweak
our definitions of other tobacco
products when we add the
synthetic las.
Um
an addictive substance because
then we'd get into drugs, but,
but I think we could broaden our
definition so that so that we're
in the definition of other
products, it's anything which
contains any amount of nicotine
is, is ingested sniff.
Swallowed, you know, whatever
the topical,
topicals that just so we try to
cover every aspect of the new
products. I would work on that.
Not giving you a task, but just.
They just, thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you.
Any other question including
Um
I would be interested in
You are true organizations
coming forward. I, I mean, you
have, we have.
Through email we've had some
discussions uh a year ago, I was
very focused on
Used in vaping.
What was eye opening as a drop
invading but they.
used in the synthetic and also
to now today hearing about the
cheapest way.
to combustible and combustible
is definitely more destructive.
Uh, to, to the lungs, or is it
just a nicotine product. So,
I would like to be able to meet
with the two of you to come up
with what you think would be.
The appropriate language
covering out of this whole
concept rather than where I was
focused last year.
And
reduced vaping and and youth
alone and got caught up in some.
and uh
Um
That
So it's, I, I understand that
it's much broader than this, at
this point.
So, uh, that's my concluding
comment.
Essentially why I asked you here
today.
I will, and I will then whatever
come up with.
circulate to the committee
chairing.
Yeah
Uh
It's been a while. Um,
So thank you for coming today.
Thank you.
OK, and now we're going to hear
from uh
Public health and new pack.
Um
If you could
I'll come forward, introduce
yourselves.
And
what we're trying to learn is.
Uh, where is the new pack
program today in terms of
staffing and uh what do you
think you'll be able to do, and
is there any legislation that
you think you need if we are
successful in getting some uh
additional tax revenue like to
devote that to prevention and
education and so forth, but
Where are we today? and what do
you think you might have in
place by next July within the
next fiscal year.
Thank you both. I just wanna
introduce myself. I'm Josh
Sloptek. I'm the uh policy
manager with DOH.
A apologizes today. She's
feeling unwell. I like to
introduce uh Doctor Jose Acosta.
He's the public health division.
director, and we will be
for misty day. Uh, my apologies,
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, uh, we had some
handouts for you that we're
going over with you and
discussed or asked for
unfortunately or uh
The back director got caught in
traffic, so.
I apolog actually maybe be a
blessing, so OK, all right, I'll
take it, so doctor, I'll let you
go ahead and take it away. Yes,
good morning, Mr. Chair. Madam
Vice Chair and members of the
committee.
A my namesota. I am the director
for the public health division
of the New Mexico Department of
Health, um, new pack, the
program falls under one of our
heroes, um, the bureau chief
acting like Josh said, appears
to be caught in traffic, so I
will be more.
glad to provide you an update
from my perspective and answer
any questions that you may have.
And so, um, I'll start off, Mr.
Chair.
She has.
Mr. Chair, this is this um
Alicia Ortiz. She's the acting.
I'm director from PAC.
Hi, good morning. My name is
Lia.
I am the bureau chief for the
populationunity Health Bureau,
um, but I'm acting direction. I
do have some handouts.
OK.
Uh, good morning.
Ready?
There are 2 documents that are
gonna be provided to you. One is
our tobacco settlement revenue
oversight requests the funding
request, uh, this goes back from
prior years from fiscal year
2023.
Through fiscal year 2022. The
other document is our brief
summary of program contractual
updates on our quit line
updates.
And programmatic updates.
And
OK.
And, and you can hit high
points. You don't have to, don't
read through them, you know,
just, just, OK, but we mostly
want to know is that
There's someone there and things
are starting to work.
That's, that's what we wanted to
know, and when do we look for a
uh a permanent position to be
an individual who is permanent.
OK.
I appreciate the clarification.
So, if I jump straight to the
last page of the color document
or pager, um, we talk about
recruitment and hiring.
So our director position we've
gone through two rounds of
interviews for the program
director. We have found a
candidate, um, we are going
through with a formal offer here
as soon as we get one from our
human resources bureau. This
decision was just made Friday.
of last week.
So we have a wonderful candidate
we hope to get filled in the
next.
weeks as soon as we get an
offer.
Um, that is for the director
position.
They've also been conducting
interviews for the program
manager position. The program
manager oversees all of our
program outreach, um, that we
were a little unsuccessful. Um,
we had completed some interviews
for, but we did not find a
program manager. We did find a
health educator or community
outreach specialist, that one we
hope to have filled in the next
2 to 3 weeks as well. You still
have those 5 vacancies, but of
the 5 vacancies, 2 will be
filled. Uh, the other three will
be posted.
And are those
Physicians
Being compensated at a level
that would be attractive.
Yeah
Uh, experience competent
individuals.
Mr. Chair
Let me give you just a little
bit of background about the
director position.
We have a very good candidate.
Um
And probably about a month and a
half ago, we made a very
as high in offer as we could for
that position, and the person
Their current job decided to
offer them more.
And so we lost that opportunity
and then what Mr. Ortiz is
talking about is the 2nd round,
um, we have made an offer which
is.
In line with the comps at at the
department and
If possible, if necessary, try
to make a a higher offer the
person doesn't accept.
But what we didn't want to do is
have the process wait to go
through many wickets. They got
approval for a higher amount.
And then sometimes lose the the
candidate.
So the answer to your question
is
We had a previous candidate, we
made a very, very generous
offer. They didn't accept it.
This time we said let's make an
offer as soon as possible, um.
It is in line with what we
offer.
And your other positions,
it's since I've been in the
committee for 40 years.
po s ition s
may be filled, not filled, not a
lot of programmatic work getting
done because the positions
weren't filled, and how is this
a priority?
Or
the Department of Health.
Um
So there be leave here today
feeling that we're actually
gonna make progress this year
because we have people in place.
I think that's what we're
asking. We know that you have to
deal with
PS and and
Or whatever we call it.
Personnel management and that
that's uh.
That's a whole another issue
that hopefully someday we get
addressed in the state, um.
Maybe next century.
The hope that it would get
there, but again, it's, it's
filling the positions. I think
there's a lot of work to do.
That's really what we want to
hear that it's gonna happen and
so that when we have our
hearings next summer.
You're actually saying, well, we
got these people, these are the
programs we're doing, and
they're working.
So it's, I'll take a crack at
that. Um, what we're doing for
the director position is we pull
down a list of candidates every
Friday.
So, instead of waiting,
For the, the
The posting to come to an end.
Every week we pull a list on
Friday and then um we look at
this on Monday, we interview on
Tuesday and then we, if we have
candidates, we, we make offers
so a little bit different that's
what happened in the past. We're
looking at this every week.
Um, and every week I, I update
the secretary because he's asked
to be updated and where we are
specifically on this director
Mr. Chairman and
where we are specifically on
this director Mr. Chair may add,
we have, um,
The candidate that we've
selected in the previous one was
from out of state, so getting
the move and all of that did add
into the component of individual
not deciding to come. This
candidate that we have chosen.
We are basing our questions on
retention, um, future plans,
goals for the program of finding
a candidate who fits the
position um that we can retain,
not just those, so, um, the
candidate, um, that you're I
guess waiting the 2nd round, um,
You mentioned that they are from
New Mexico, so do they have a
really good understanding of the
tobacco, you know, um, programs
and
Yes.
Yes, for sure. We are very
confident in this candidate, uh,
has a long history with tobacco,
um, to include Hawaii and
Illinois. Um, so we're very the
background in tobacco control,
but they do understand New
Mexico too, but have they had
any experience with New Mexico's
program.
Um
indirectly, not directly with is
probably Mr. Chair.
probably a better
match and so you know.
works out.
Um
I see you, you have some other
besides the hiring, there are a
few others.
points on here.
the
Working with the MCOs, um.
Uh, and any other key points
that you want to point out them
all.
Um, I'm gonna continue forward
just at the beginning of the
document going over some key
points. Um, I will touch on the
NCOs that's towards the end.
Um, our program goals have not
changed. That's part of our
five-year action plan. We have
not changed those, um, at the
last hearing we discussed what
those goals were, um, our
objectives, we did discuss the
decrease in prevalence of the
nicotine use products, um, both
in our youth and our young
adults, um.
Where
Happy and excited to see it go
in that curve, that direction.
Um, our program contractual
updates, we have
Are are
those are request for proposals.
We have an environmental
strategy request for proposal I
discussed this last time, but I
wanted to go more into details.
So this RFP has 6 categories. Of
those 6 categories, all have
been awarded contractors all are
fully executed and they're all
4-year contracts. They're all
moving. We are near to of each
one of these. So category one,
we have rescue agency that's a
fully executed contract.
Um, that's our prevention
strategies for youth category 2
is for young adults. Um, that
one is also awarded strategies
for smoke for uh multi-unit
housing.
Category 4 secondhand smoke in
Native American community
category 5 advisement and
outreach, and then category 6 is
our capacity development. I
wanted to focus on category 5
and 6 for you all. I know that
that's been in question a lot
and that's with our contractor
Constellation Consulting. We
have contracted with
Constellation Consulting, um
category 5 for a few years.
They're not new to the new pet
program, Constellation
Consulting has been doing this
work for multiple years.
Um, at least the last 4 or 5
years. The new category that
they were awarded this RFP go
round this category 6. This one
does touch on the coalition that
is being
built, not rebuilt, but they are
structuring it.
Um,
That is part of category 6. So
constellation Consulting has two
contracts that they were awarded
through the the bidding.
Um
And that I believe is on the
last.
It's not. I will, I want to
touch separately on that one.
You guys may have questions
about constellation and the
coalition we'll touch after.
Um, that's all the contracts, so
we also have the contracts we
have an evaluation contract that
one has not changed for the last
10 years. That's Wyoming, a
survey, that's what we callISA.
University of Wesack provides
all the evaluation services.
They evaluate all of our
contractors, um, across NewAC.
Our health communications.
Um, say like Paris agreement, we
in the past had a request for
proposal. The state of New
Mexico now has a statewide price
agreement for all media and
marketing. We're going with
real-time solutions. This is
done through our marketing and
communications team with
Department of Health. Um, that
is
Are your lamb and Chris Harris,
you met them last time, um, but
that contract is still in
progress. We do not have it
finalized, but we have the quote
from the vendor.
Uh, we have a hospital and
healthcare exemption. This is
also in our health
communications. This is our
youth engagement.
Uh, with rescue agency, it is
not complete yet, but we have a
provider agreement in progress.
This is for our evolvement, um,
our outreach for you pro
process.
Our cessation services are, are
under an RFP. This is our
nicotine addiction treatment
services.
This is the one that goes into
the MCOs that I'll talk about
next. So consumer wellness
solutions, also known as RVO
Health.
is our contracted.
Uh, nicotine quit line, vaping
servicesation services. We also
have a healthcare exemption that
we're working on through the
University of New Mexico for
cultural culturally appropriate
communication, that one is not
executed yet, but in progress.
That's all of our contracts.
So I want to go into the MCO's,
uh.
like you were asking, so we are
partnering with our quit line,
RBO Health, who is our uh
contracted, contracted nicotine
cessation services. We are
entering into a partnership and
agreement uh with our NCOs, our
managed care organizations.
This will allow them to have one
quit line across the state of
New Mexico. So if you call that
number, no matter who you are,
how you're funded or insured,
they will get those bills sent
back to Department of Health for
us to collect that revenue from
those NCOs, uh, for those
individuals.
Um
Hi Mark Highline things that
also be marketed by RBO so RBO
does all of our quit line
marketing across the state. They
have a huge campaign and you
guys are interested. I actually
just got some of their materials
last week at a conference, um,
but they have liate free, which
is targeted to our young adults,
uh, and this is a huge campaign
that they are, they have a
national campaign that they have
done.
And they are doing now in New
Mexico with a free.
That's what we're doing in
partnership with MCOs. We don't
have the agreement executing.
I think that was mostly that
nothing at this time, uh, Mr.
Chair, but we're open for
questions as anything that we.
Thank you very much for
will be checking in with you,
uh.
uh early next summer.
So open it up to
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just
have, uh, I was glad to hear
that the MCOs are gonna be
billed instead of, so is that
gonna be a fee for service kind
of thing, is it, how are you
gonna determine what the NCOs.
Correct, a feed for service. OK.
All right. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank
you. Um,
have a document that has all of
the different contractors' names
or is this what you're
Um
Telling us in
In your presentation.
Yes, but I'm sure it's, it's in
the 4-page document of the
contractor's names are below as
well as component of contract.
OK, and the contract for quit
line.
Um, is that?
We heard
That
Kind of
Stopped or there wasn't a
continuation for it, is that
Um
Ongoing now and getting
Calls and
Respons for people.
It has not stopped.
Uh
Madam Jared the services are,
are ongoing so consumer wellness
solutions is our contracted quit
line and they are great. And um
What type of um nicotine
replacement therapy or the NRT
um.
It's being offered and for how
long?
I need to find the information.
I apologize. I don't have it
right in front of me, um, are we
talking just adults or youth, so
they're providing uh NRT for our
youth in this new live bait free
campaign as well, um, depending
on
The MCO, it could be 6 of any
NRT or it could be 8 weeks, um,
it's gonna depend on which SCO
that the color.
But I don't have it directly in
front of me. I apologize. Well,
6 to 8 weeks is that long enough
as research showed that it needs
to be longer for people. We have
had discussions uh
Madam Chair, we've had
discussions with RVO about 10
weeks, um, as well, right now, 8
weeks is what what.
Most NCOs and we are providing.
So in your discussions, are you
able to expand that, correct?
OK, yes, to 10 weeks.
Uh, we have the option, yeah.
So, are you taking that up?
Are you going to expand it.
10 weeks. It hasn't been fully
decided yet, um.
I, I know that other states
utilize more NRT uh weeks, and
what MCOs have already put into
place.
But I, I can, you can let us
know also, Mr. Chair and uh
Alicia, um.
What
You know, expanded funds you
would need.
that
There are funds, but you just,
you know.
haven't allocated for that.
I think um
It's really tough to, you know,
start and stop and need longer
than just 6 or.
Um, and I don't know what
determines that.
Um
And
So
Oh, I know what it was, we, you
know, last, um, year or two had
problems with um constellation
getting
Funding they need and they don't
pay their contractors until they
get their funding.
Um, is, has that been resolved
where it's on a continuous basis
where we don't have, um, you
know, subcontractors to
Constellation.
You know, uh
Not getting their funds and
Not being able to, you know,
implement their programs,
correct? Yes, Madam Chair, um,
they are fully procured, uh,
with tobacco settlement funds
through the new CAP program.
They do have to procurements
because of the two categories
fully procured, um, and we,
they, uh,
OK. And does and their invoices
are paid under.
A reasonable basis, yes.
So we don't have that problem
happening anymore.
Uh, so, um, madam, vice chair.
I, I wish I could tell you it
was perfect.
It is not. We work on it every
day.
And so we are working through
the
Healthcare exemptions and the
provider agreements to make sure
that all the all the contractors
have purchase orders in place
and get that moving, but I, I
can't tell you that that 1 or 2
or other contractors may have
not been paid just yet, but
we're working very hard to
change that way of doing
business.
If I may, on that point.
Last year funding was cut
because the procurement that
came in.
Through
Settlement money.
Did not have enough funding.
Continue
With
We still
face that risk.
In years going forward.
Mr. Chair, I, I
I don't think we will
I don't think we will. so many
versions this year of funds, we
want to make sure that all that
money is now um
Relegated to the to the to the.
So
Um
If we come up in the
Like
it's kind of a bad afterwards
way that we have of doing the
accounting because we're.
We're projecting we're gonna get
money and then
Something happens in the
settlement.
don't get the money.
Is there a reserve fund that
would fill that gap.
Or do we need some sort of
legislation so that we don't
enter into that kind of risk
again.
There, you know, there may be
things in the tobacco settlement
fund when it spins off more
revenue.
And so forth, the complexity of
it, but I'm, I'm trying to find
a way, and maybe this is a
discussion we would have with
LFC offline that we absolutely
minimize the risk of program.
Um
Minimize the risk of disruption
because of the way we do
projections. And so,
I'll leave it at.
Um, I'll be happy to interface
on that conversation, but would
like to get assurance that we
have some
Find somewhere.
To come in and pick up if we
face that loss, and it's a very
complex set.
Mathematics
So Mr. Chair, at this point we
are predicting that we will be
able to cover our requirements
with the funding we have.
Uh
Um, it's
We look at projections on a
monthly basis.
And um we're projecting that we
should be able to cover
everything, but as you said, if
the funds are less, it would
make it much more complex
conversation.
Haven't been on that point again
then.
That maybe the way that we're
finding this has to have some
different formula.
Associated with it and we need
to go to the LFC to figure out
what it is that it's not so much
at risk funding. I mean, I know
the government always has a
bailout.
If the funds aren't there, the
funds aren't there too bad.
Um, but still, I think there's a
way to to.
But in more assurance that the
funds will continue to be there
and we don't experience this
again.
I'm still not sure.
Um
Mr. Chair and uh.
Doctor Acosta, um.
So,
I'm looking at the health
communication, um, I take it
that's your media.
Tell me um how the program
Media is purchased and kind of
walk me through the process, um.
You know, for like, um,
How it's approved and, uh, that
is our media contract.
They are in progress right now
trying to get the contractual
instrument.
Approved. This is our website.
So they will maintain our
website, our quit line, um.
Promotional.
swag
In there as well.
Um, I don't have all of the
information on how our media is
done, that is the process of Ao
Lamb and Chris Harris, our
Department of Health, media
marketing or marketing and
communications team.
Um, they are in charge of
approving every item that goes
out media wise from any of our
contractors, not just internal
documents. So these are also
through our contracts.
Um, through the quit line
through
Our 24, all of those go through
our marketing coms team, um.
So the quit line.
Information.
is on your website, but it's
other, I mean like do you have a
marketing media campaign that,
you know, has the different
messages that need to go out,
and is that what you're saying
has to go through this approval
process.
I'm sure that's what's being
developed through uh real
solutions. It, it is an approved
just yet, but that is our um
ideal situation is using this
utilizing this IT contract.
To ensure that they are all in
one.
Does that include with all of
your contractors like through
Constellation, have to go
through a, correct, yes.
So, that seems really cumbersome
and and doesn't allow them to be
able to
their
Their mission or their market,
their target market.
So my the the goal is rather
than having 3 or 4 different
campaigns.
that looked different, is to
bring in all under one umbrella.
That's, that's the goal. That's
what's happening. We're in the
process of doing right now, but
rather than having
Contractors
Each do a little bit of a
different campaign. We're trying
to have 11.
that is uniform and that's what
we're in the process of right
now.
Mr. Chair and
Costa, um.
Does that make it, do you think,
so that
When you're trying to reach your
target market that if you have
one consolidated message that
you're missing out or just that?
Campaing food different target.
Markets that the contractors can
use those materials and things
like that. I know you want
conformity, but if there's too
much, you're going to lose out
on some of the niche markets
that
We need to reach.
Um
Mr. Chair, Miss uh.
My, I agree with you 100%. So it
is
More of a look and more of a
Um
It looks similar, but certainly
we have to make sure that we hit
those niches a little bit
different in each place, so that
that's the goal.
Um, I don't know if we're there
yet, but our goal is to have
something that looks similar,
but certainly focuses on the
different niches thank you Mr.
Chair. Um, I hope that works so
that
Um
We can at local levels, you
know, still, and with all the
different um contractors with
Constellation, um, is there
enough going on around the
state, um,
Like empowerment group working
with youth, um, I know if they
had more funds, they could
expand.
And um do a lot more.
Um
That would reach
You know, in the schools and um
You know, right to students
instead of, you know, something
really broad.
I
Mr. Ortiz.
Thank you.
Uh, Madam Chair.
Like I was discussing, so I have
a little bit and I, I do want
you guys to have these cause
they're just hot off the presses
last week. Um, but this is the
campaign that is around the
state right now. This is through
our RBO Health there.
elevate free campaign and, and
this is not developed by
Department of Health. This is
just approved by Department of
Health.coms team has seen this
campaign, um, told the
contractor RBO Health Consumer
wellness.
Go ahead, you know, get this out
it statewide. Um, this is being,
uh,
Given to schools all across the
state, our contractor last week
actually just got 3 to 4 more
schools down south that she's
gonna go visit, um, and table at
their uh parent nights and
events with these uh live free
so
We are going statewide with our
youth, um, our baby.
campaigns, we
question. I was just so excited
to show you guys all the big
recapping because it's new, um,
But we are aren't limiting our
contractors to just utilize the
Department of Health marketing.
We are asking that they
Continue to collaborate with us,
show us their campaigns, um.
To ensure that we are getting
the same message out across the
state, not just our message, but
we are.
collaborating with all of our
partners and we know what our
contractors are doing for all of
the state communities.
OK. um, thank you, Mr. Chair,
and, um, Lia, um, this, this is
great that, you know, to stop
vaping, but as we're finding
out, um, students are now going
to other synthetic nicotine
products that um
They don't inhale, but still are
seeing the effects, is there any
way that, you know, live free
could also say um
But don't go to other products.
How about nicotine free, um, and
then saying,
Or maybe it can be in the
support tools that they think
that.
Do you include in
This, um
Website
to stay nicotine free.
Yes, ma'am sure, we do it. It
also includes the pouches, any
nicotine product rate.
Um, but it's not real clear if
they don't go to that website.
Do not go to something else,
they go, oh, OK, I get the
message that they free, but, you
know, and then go on to the
other which is what we're
finding, uh.
So frequent. So it might be
something you consider. Thank
you.
I think that's all.
Thank you, Representative
Chasey.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank
you very much.
How, how did you say these are
being distributed?
Throughout New Mexico.
Uh
They are being distributed in
the actual schools, high school.
And are you working then with
the Department of Education
with, with, with public
education department or with the
individual school districts.
Um, charter schools within each
district and so forth.
Um, right now it's as they uh
push forward into RVO to PED
though we do have connections.
So, um, just
Help me understand, Mister
Chair.
You said going into the school,
so you're dealing with
individual districts.
To get them
To there.
Correct.
And are they letting you know?
I mean
I mean, obviously they don't do
the private schools, but all of
our charter schools are public
schools. So I'm just wondering
how
How
When we have such a large state
and so, um, sparsely populated
and
geographically diverse. I'm just
wondering, I mean, this looks
really good. I just want to be
sure everybody's getting it.
So Senator Hickey and committee,
um.
With the hiring of the director
along with our community
outreach specialists, our
community outreach specialist is
going to be that person who
takes the lead on these
projects, um.
It's something that the health
educators that we currently have
in place have attempted to do,
but there are only 3 of them,
um, and they can only meet so
many needs of the state. But
that is our goal, the community
outreach specialist is to get
all of the campaigns into the
school districts, no matter
where they are geographically or
otherwise, we want the messaging
out.
And but out and available, but
no, there is not currently have
that is.
Consistent enough.
Thank you so much, Mr. Chair,
um, and I, and I appreciate
that. It's just occurring to me
that you do have 112 legislators
who represent all of these
districts and you may want to be
sure that
Um, you know, really target them
and say,
Are, are these getting to your
schools and uh how can we help
you make sure that of that and.
And especially we have new
people who are coming in and
we'll be anxious to, um,
Try to be helpful and visible in
their districts, so I think that
might be an idea as well. Thank
you. Representative Thompson.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I started
small but.
Things have come to my brain, so
in terms of this, it seems kind
of milk toast to me. I mean,
there's no.
Nicotine is addictive, there's
no, it's bad for your health,
it's just kind of, you know, oh,
let's let's stop vaping and and
and besides that, it feels kind
of like as has been stated, you
know the youth are strongly
going to nicotine.
pouches and this this doesn't
even.
You know, even and, and I feel
like that's really a missed
opportunity like we're trying to
close the door on vaping after
everyone has gotten out, um, so,
um.
And I mean, not everybody, but
we're this is, this is to go uh
for our youth, I mean, there's
there's people who vape who are
older and uh we, that's a whole
different ball game, but I'm
just a little disappointed in
this, and then in terms of um.
Let me see, I got too many
things going on here. Um,
But it feels to me like and I
used to chair this committee
years ago, um, that there is a
pretty good um tobacco.
Um, coalition. So why are, why
aren't you instead of building a
new coalition working with the
coalition that already exists.
Uh, Mr. Chair, uh.
And committee, um.
I want to start by talking about
the livedate free so.
The card is meant to be
discreet. I know it doesn't talk
specifically about pouches.
But we were intentionally
discreet for our youth and young
adults, so that it isn't uh as.
It doesn't draw attention to
their peers and classmates
whenever they pick one up and
put it in their backpack and
walk by, so that it was meant to
be discreet, I know it doesn't
talk about patches or tobacco,
but it was meant to be um.
A Little low key for our youth
and young adults.
Um, this is only one campaign of
many though, so this is just the
newest campaign that we have
out.
Um
To answer your second part, um.
So we
I sorry, I apologize, I should
have had this out.
Constellation consulting isn't
built rebuilding the coalition
from scratch. So they are taking
partners um from the previous
coalition.
They have changed the name of
the coalition just to nicotine
free New Mexico, but they are
not rebuilding it, they are
reaching out to anyone that was
on the coalition representatives
to gain a better footing in.
Our advocacy leaders. Um, so
it's not that we dismantle that
foolition.
Um, it's just with the awardee
of this new bid, they went
through the competitive process,
constellation consulting was
awarded, so they are to take on
a coalition. The previous
holders of the coalition, um,
Still have that.
So is the the new coalition
gonna be selective and or is
anybody welcome to be part of
it. Anyone is welcome. They are
reaching out to statewide, um,
arms wide open, if you have
suggestions, please give them to
us.
Um, but they do have a plan, and
I apologize, I may not have
enough copies, but I actually
have in can send it out to you
guys, um, for how they're going
to get their advocacy committee
is what we're calling it, not
just a coalition. But thank you
for that, Mr. Chair. So why are
RFPs just going out in November.
I mean, we've, we've had this
issue with so many other um
things that we've been trying to
do. Oh well, you know, we have
it, we haven't put him out for
proposal yet, um.
Uh, healthcare authority is one
of them, um, you know, oh well,
you know, we started working on
it and.
September, when it should have
been, you know, worked on and
ready to go in July, so I'm just
wondering, um, why is
everything, why is it so slow?
So, so, Mr. Chair,
Representative Thompson, more
than the RFP, the HHEs, the, the
um health and healthcare
exemptions. I think those are
the ones that have really been
delayed and um there are
multiple reasons.
Um, that they've been delayed,
um, but I
I know for a fact that one of
them has now been completed and
we're in the provider agreement
phase and the other is um moving
and should be approved soon. So
these are the HHEs the Health
and healthcare exemptions that
allow us to contract
specifically with companies that
have services that are not
available um through other
means.
So Mister Chair, so that, um,
that's one of my questions.
Hospital and healthcare
exemptions means that you can
contract with them without going
through the process.
That is, that is correct, but
it's not that they're
pre-selected is that they have
services that um are unique and
can be provided by that group
specifically for the services
that we need. So those are the
HHEs.
So, Mr. Chair, are there not
other um organizations that
could do the same that could be
competitively. So, so that's,
that's the reason for the HAE.
The HHE we've gone out, we've
looked. These are services that
are unique.
that can be provided by this one
provider.
Mr. Chair, so you'd know that
there are no other providers
that can provide that. Mr.
Chairs, Representative Thompson,
that's part of the HHE process.
OK, thank you for that. And
then, um, let's see.
And and I see on on the the
colored paper that um there's
money going to UNM for
culturally appropriate
communications, is that strictly
around tobacco or is that
broader?
Uh, Mr. Chair and Representative
Thompson, that is strictly. OK,
good.
Um, let's see.
Um
And then, yeah, you talk, I'm
going back to this, you talk
about low key.
Nicotine use in youth.
Should not be low key, I mean,
we're house is on fire and I'm
not exactly sure why not saying
anything on the card makes it
easier for someone to be
discreet. I mean, if you pick up
the card.
I, I, it's, I mean, we've spent
decades trying to get things on
on cigarette packs that say what
the dangers are, and I don't
know why we're being so timid,
um, I, I just.
Think we need to act like it's
the emergency that it is.
Um
And then, uh, I think that's uh
that's all I have. Thank you,
Mr. Chair. Thank you.
Anyone else? If not, I will
finish up with a just a couple
of
Next steps, um.
What I'm hearing today, uh.
Sounds more promising than
In the past, it sounds as I
mean, there's accountability and
people are really focused.
And this is the department um
one thing that I am still
concerned about is the ability
to follow through in
collaboration with other
departments, the Department of
Education was brought up. I
mean, how do we, how do we, how
do we get that there and I know
we did have a meeting of key
people from those departments at
one time and and the desire to
work together it's there, but
how, how is that going to go?
And I'm, I'm not gonna ask you
for the answer to that. Um.
When we meet again next year
and, and maybe even some of the
health committees, there may be
some follow-up as we're learning
as a legislature, we need to do
that much more than we have in
the past, would like to hear
about how you're collaborating
with the other departments. Um,
the
We're we're talking about
attacks and money from that
would go to education, uh,
prevention.
And um also to enforcement and
we've had some good ideas.
This morning, so I just want you
to be aware that no promises
around that. It's going to be a
tough, very, very tough hill to
climb, but uh there's a good
deal of logic behind that. And
then finally the point that was
made, um.
The, you know, and, and far be
it for me, I'm not sure.
Are we in degeneration A yet,
uh, now that we've hit Z,
um the whoever, I, I mean, I
know.
This wouldn't appeal to me, but
I know.
There are different appeals and
so forth, but the key is getting
across and it's hard to say,
hey, nicotine is bad when
somehow
People who a lot of people use
it to like it and all it does
actually is put you in more
depression in mood after its
effect, uh, kind of like
alcohol. Um, but
We really need to focus on these
other products, and I'm, I'm not
sure, but I would hope that
When we meet again.
In early summer.
That you've made some progress
and how, how, how do we educate
about that? I mean, I don't
know.
Uh, I don't have any
preconceptions, but I'm hoping
we'll see that being taken
forward.
So
Um, if anyone else has any other
comments, otherwise we'll.
Mr. Chair, I'm sorry to go after
you. I, I thought of a couple
more things and then um one of
the people who was who was here
suggested a couple of things,
and that is that um.
I was, when you mentioned other
departments, I was thinking, you
know, maybe early childhood too
because of the home visiting and
if there are.
Young parents who are smoking at
home, it would be a good thing
for um
For them to maybe have something
about um secondhand smoke and um
asthma and, and that sort of
thing and then also, um,
The um.
Well, the early childhood I'm
visiting as part of it, but
then, uh, the other suggestion
was, um,
Some of the sporting events or
areas of interest and and
participation, um, maybe the New
Mexico athletics Association,
um,
Some of the the soccer groups
and, and, and so forth. I mean,
I would think everybody who
wants kids to be healthy would
appreciate.
Um
Joining hands if they, if they
had something, and I know uh
Representative Thompson brought
it.
Uh, maybe this wasn't snazzy
enough, but I'm sure that Miss
Siegel and
But in the hash might remember.
Where was it? And this was a
long time ago where they had
something in the urinals at the
high school where upon
activation by water, there was a
message.
And I mean that that grabs
people, you know that something
like that. Now this is, this is
middle school, but you know, one
of the most powerful tools about
countermark, uh, regarding
counter marketing, um,
I was the.
The media literacy at at the um
middle school level. And so when
kids can rebel against big.
Big advertising instead of their
parents telling them don't
smoke, um, that was effective.
So, and I, I just don't think we
should ever give up on the media
literacy part. It would be nice
if, if our entire population
were a little bit.
More illiterate
Regarding the media. Thank you.
Sorry, Mr.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and um
that was a really chasey, um, I
used to teach media literacy um
for alcohol, um.
Underage use
And mostly for driver's ed
classes, but um, yes, that's
really important targeted and
things like that, but um also
um.
In on your website, I was
wondering if you could include
more.
Research based, well, the
research based information, such
as from your epidemiologists on,
you know, uh, different things,
but also, uh, some of the
research on tobacco use and and
how to.
Use uh marketing.
And what messaging is really
important. I hope you're
including, um, not just people's
ideas cause um telling kids, you
know, like on the card that it
lowers stress. That's why they
they to lower stress, so telling
them it'll lower their stress,
not to vape it and.
Not sure goes over really well
or um.
And, and to also let them know
that they're under 21 and it's
against the law, even though we
aren't going to.
You know, arrest them or
prosecute them, but we are going
after the people who supply
them, um, but, uh, using
consider, you know.
Research and evidence-based red.
from across the
Mr. Chair and members of the
committee, thank you for your
recommendations. We will
certainly discuss them with our
marketing team, um, the.
The ECECD visits like what a
great idea. So thank you for
that, for that recommendation.
And certainly I, I hear you.
There's
Ideas and then there's evidence
based and what what I hear you,
um, Madame Weiser saying is.
Include uh incorporate the
evidence basis as part of the,
the campaign.
So thank you.
You're welcome. And Mr. Chair,
just as we're talking about
evidence base also for how long
uh people should receive um the
NRT.
You know, if, if it says you
should give him 12 weeks. Let's
do it. Let's find a way.
Um, so that we don't have people
attempting and going off.
So, thank you for considering
that. Thank you. Um, I have to
get to another meeting, but I
want to thank you for coming
today. I want to thank everyone
for participating, particularly
those of you who made long
drives, um, and I want to thank
the committee for participating
in the meetings. I think it's
been a very informative year and
we will be able, I look forward
to hoping uh look forward to
building on this as we go
forward in the future, more
experience.
Different legislature coming up
and maybe we will be able to get
some of the things as but we get
smarter all the time, and I want
to thank my vice chair for all
of her input and help and the
other committee members who have
pretty much made it to all the
meetings.
Well thank you very much. We
just need to do.
Uh
Public comment and minutes. Um,
and it has everyone on the
committee been able to look at
the minutes and do have a motion
to pass.
Second
All those in favor by saying I
thanks and their past and uh the
vice chair will finish out with
public comment, and again, thank
you all.
And also um to think um.
Majority Leader Tracy for her
years of being on this committee
and
Do the diligence of um working
with.
As as as new members come in.
Helping us with the
Historical. I think, I think
gradually we've gotten to the
point where the body believes us
that we have to get these laws
passed if we don't want to lose
it mediation.
In the future, but, uh, I mean,
sat in front of the house tax
committee and the chairman's
going, I don't know you. I know
him and speaking to AG that was
with me.
So we, we have, we've come a
ways, we have more, more to do,
but I think the reward.
for me this year is for the
fund, the permanent fund.
To have become a revenue stream.
That's been.
We thought it was gonna be in 20
years and it's maybe it's just
been 24, but.
It's not too bad.
So that was my
Madam Vice Chair, I just wanted
just to say, again, thank you,
Representative Chasey leader
Chasey, my friend.
Um
You will be missed
But I know that we can still
call you.
For any further guidance and
such because um
You've given up and just want to
say thank you.
Boom my heart. Thank you.
I guess since we're doing a
tribute to uh leader Jay. I
won't tell some of the stories
about how she is as a game
player, cause she's vicious, I
will tell you that, but she's,
it's been someone I looked up to
since before I got into the
legislature, um.
And she will be greatly missed
and not left alone, I promise
that.
So I, I wanna thank you, Gail,
for everything you've done for
this place for the state of New
Mexico for all these years and
uh.
Enjoy your retirement, yes, yes,
but that's this week. I mean,
that's right. It's the next 4
days,
we'll see you, but I just wanted
to publicly say you're
wonderful.
Um
I soon we didn't have anyone
sign up for public comment here
in person. We don't have anyone
online. Thank you.
Erin for checking on that.
Oh, OK, Nat.
Miss Dean
And Buddy.
Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark,
bark, bark, bark, bark, bark.
It's a
I was just making a joke for
since you named Buddy. Um, my
name is Nat Dean. um, I'm a
disability advocate and I'm a
person with multiple
disabilities and in a former
life, I did have a career in um
advertising public relations and
communications. Um.
I
Maybe feel like I'm 16 or 20
years of age, but I'm way past
that at this point, nearing 70,
but to reach an audience where
the audience lives, where the
audience, um.
Uh, connects where um the events
that they will attend, someone
may not attend a tabling events,
and how do we reach that
audience at a place where what
is their currency?
What is the currency? What is
the meaningful piece that will
reach the desired end result and
what does that communication
tool. And sometimes we think
about, well, what would create a
version like.
Uh
The commercials with the.
permanent trach where you, you
know, make sure you tell people
you love them before you no
longer have a voice. Um, but
also kind of meeting people
where they live of do we put the
candy cigarettes and the
cigarette box and the cigarette
box when you open it up, shows
you what that's going to look
like as we're moving into
pouches is the pouch, we don't
want to create the pouch
connection that it's candy, but
create the connection that the
pouch is gonna be delivery
system that.
may not give you exactly what
you want. And so I look at the
connectivity of that and I also
think about the diversity of
communication bases and the
literacy. If we have a literacy
level reading of say 5 or 6, and
we're communicating in a
literacy level of 21 or 30, are
we reaching the demographic that
I want that we want to reach or
are we reaching a demographic
that might not see, that might
not hear, that might communicate
in a different way or utilize a
different language base, so that
cultural competency.
Which is much further than we
might always think about that
avenue of um communication and
thank you, Leader Tracy for your
years of service, um, I did not
appropriate address Mr. Chair,
uh, because he left the room,
but Madam vice chair, and thank
you to everyone for your
generous service and your
generous commitment and um
See you around the roundhouse.
Thank you for
always being there and on on
Zoom or here. I appreciate that.
Um, I
Uh, public comment, but I was
just going, I forgot.
OK.
Thank you,
um, I um forgot to ask. I know
we got a list um and Josh, this
is directed to um DOH, um, the
contractors that are under
constellation.
I think that would give us an
idea of what programs and
marketing are happening, um,
within those programs and we
don't know exactly who all of
those, um, the contractors under
constellation are.
And, and what they're they'll be
doing, um, will help us give it,
get an idea of how broad um.
The outreaches around the state
and also what their uh
accomplishments are.
Would that be all right?
OK, thank you. Yes.
