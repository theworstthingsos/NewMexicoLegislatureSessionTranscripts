We will fix that.
00 we have one now now.
Now you have 2.
Thank you
Thank you so much,
um,
uh
to uh present
uh land
currently, um,
Land has been.
Uh,
as agricultural.
Uh, several,
uh, criteria one is a status and
residential property tax,
uh, currently with this bill is
just clarify and to also
authorize um uh the ability
to maintain a status.
um.
So currently you cant status if
you
uh if you are.
Y.
Because then you were generating
enough revenue your business
could be the statin and you not
only
struggling.
Um, because there's a status
saying that
right now has the right to say
that this is part of the drought
the water management,
um, the MRCCD
Um, because there's a status
saying that
right now has the right to say
that this is part of the drought
the water management,
um, the MRCCG.
Yeah.
I represent
um,
and so this is a community,
um, uh, increase the hardship by
agricultural status.
authority to
to be able to drought to
infrastructure failure.
Um, I have Martin Fisher
he um he is only to talk about
the legal technical aspects of
the bill and
I.
Thank you.
I'm in.
For those who are.
Raise your hands.
He
now
um we'll have those that are in
favor,
uh, the mic, right, right, you

if you are in favor of your hand
so we can get this mic over to
you.
Thank you.
State your name.
Good morning.
Sure.
Good morning,
I'm
John
and um
you know, uh,
you know, we do
do
we go into
with surface water supplies
are going to be instances where
districts
may not be adequately
represented in the USA.
so
in programs
to
uh certify
you.
On Zoom would like to speak in
favor of.
Montoya.
Hello, good morning.
Thank you for hearing me.
Thank you for hearing me. So I'm
Rudy Montoya with the New Mexico
Asequia Association. I'm also a
registered lobbyist. I'm also a
parente in Rainesville, Norte
Sea, and I just wanted to note
that the New Mexico Ase
Association supports this bill.
Thank you for your time.
Thank you.
Mm.
OK, now we're gonna go to uh
positions so you can speak.
Not district.
I commend the sponsoring this
issue.
The
drawing is problematic in the
state of New Mexico because we
have a limited weather
monitoring stations around the
state.
Cred leading to create
monitoring
and then that'll give us a win
is occurring within the area.
Or you know if you lived here a
long time.
11 line will have
on one side and the other fields
is dry on the other side.
So it's it's hard to determine
whether or not you're having a
real condition
and then there's two factors.
Uh-huh
OK.
I
we do appreciate that sponsors
the divisions have the staff
expertise,
um, we really are very
non-regulatory programs and um I
8% and
help with improvements,
uh, even dry land crops things
like that,
but we did
get a lot of the state's still
going on,
um, at this point, um, we just
really would prefer to not be,
uh, that that kind of um
responsibility. Thank you.
Thank you.
Anyone else?
OK, we're back to the sponsor.
Would you like to respond to any
of the public.
Thank you
so um
this is the authority to the
water
systems if
they are um there are so many of
them because we are so many of
them
have both.
We already have archy.
on
the River and was in and you uh
you're still under the authority
of the
district. So, um, they would
have the authority to determine
the drought. I appreciate a more
on
the River and was in and you uh
you're still under the authority
of the
district. So, um, they would
have the authority to determine
the drought. I appreciate
that
this is dealing with drought.
use
our information,
which is an act of God,
environmental and so what I'm
concerned about is we have such
a
we have a great irrigation and
historical
failures and that
we are not getting our design
you very much.
Thank you. We're gonna move on
to questions.
you representative um I have um
I have a few questions for me
because I I
first time I'm
just trying to trying to learn
here but um I know one of the
biggest things that stood out to
me was the authority to so many
entities.
Um, do you have the resources to
take on this I mean that's
that's full employees that that.
you know, you know, they have
the resources to be able to take
this on.
Thank you for your question.
So we're not requiring them to
provide a certain type of uh
data. What
we believe is
the damn they don't need to
provide that's what we're trying
to do is we don't want them to
have to.
that burdens of providing all of
the data to
the
data to tax
the
water
that is required,
um, is there like a specific
able to do that is it, is it
like you said,
is it they
they see that there's a
different issue,
um, you know, um.
Can 11.
Kind of kind of negate the
others I don't see any rules in
different entities the ability
to do this, but there isn't any
specific way they're supposed to
do
to navigate that?
Thank you for your question.
I just wanna make sure to
clarify, are you asking if one
another.
Or are you asking what is the
measure what are we measuring to
determine route.
Um, I'm a little 1st 1st
1st 1st let's um let's go with
is there is there a certain set
of rules these boxes and then
then this can happen or is it
just like one person's
interpretation, which could be
different depending on.
because there are so many
entities and they are
not as um our public comments
whether or not one
of them and they all have their
own set of rules to determine.
G.
Um, thank you, that, that, that,
that's what's what concerns
concerning me everybody has
their own set of rules, um, and
so it's kind of like, um, you
know, depending on the hierarchy
if I don't like what I
because my mom might have a
different set of rules like
those kind of things in order to
get what I want like the fact
that they're not.
A set of rules that all these
entities are gonna
really process especially
there's so many um chef chefs in
the kitchen now. It's not not
just USDA there's so many,
different,
um.
Are they they um have you spoke
with um the,
the USC or the federal team was
sitting back and letting them
what they need to
um as far as far as on the state
level, like have you, did you
talk to them to them at all?
I think my I think my
I think, I think.
my I think my,
I think, I think.
No,
government is turning a drought
for reasons
only assessment. So this is not
being
eligible
as well and I would also like to
address.
They're not just
how they were depicted
and it's not just,
um, are in charge of delivering
to,
um, I
the
engineer's office
the
engineer
um
and so these are,
um,
offices and agencies.
Um, thank you, Madam,
I definitely uh experts, but
what
what so what you're assuming
we're saying is that they all
all the time.
could you repeat the question? I
said,
um, I agree that they are they
are the
the,
the experts in this experts
sometimes don't agree 100%. So,
um, so, uh, what they want
because you're giving it to
to a bunch of people. It would
be responsibility to the
engineers or to
like that's not really,
but you get to essentially over
5050 different
that can um that can
you know, I'm expert or not, I
can still.
So you representative
so we already have a structure
of management and our
state and where what
what this is doing is boos on
the ground I know he has
collapsed and that's why we need
that.
But the
uh.
Creation.
Um,
thank you Madam, you, uh, you
mentioned the state in here?
OK, so I,
I did,
um.
Um, I don't um.
So what happens exactly when
land is designated um in a
drought, um, so, so
that of course is keep it
agriculture, right?
right
that is that we're trying to do
it if it's in that rough status,
um, you're trying to keep it in
the assessment
and
the
There are many criteria to
qualify as agricultural property
tax status. And
one of them
is
the yield of the venue.
That
um the law
and
That um the law can be
yours.
salt on the you have a you have
an infrastructure failure.
OK,
so you are trying this whole
thing is to keep certain
properties that are affected
by an
OK, so you are trying this whole
thing is to keep certain
properties that are affected by
um status, right?
Um,
is there uh this you know this
and that kind of stuff that that
we do do we know if it works
well with all of these.
Thank
you a lot of um.
research on this type of
program.
I don't say that it's a you know
we have a very unique historical
thousands of years irrigation
system
in the state that I don't think
you're always in other states
have found other communities.
OK, thank you, thank you, Madam.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Like,
like the first water always
interesting and.
We have a lot more members this
time around, uh.
and
the congratulations.
Uh
Madam, uh.
But what is it that brought
brought this bill forward what's
the issue that
Is it, is it a.
One particular issue.
Uh, issues that pertain to this
bill or what, what brought this
bill in layman's terms.
what
you.
Thank you Madam Chair, and thank
you thank you for your questions
for clarification,
and so I just wanna make sure I
thank you.
Um, I, um, so
it was originally inspired by my
district. We had wooden
district and it collapsed and we
we realized that um
that some of the property had
been threatened status of crops.
found out that
And we also know that
in the
delivery
we're getting to that.
So
why you do not want
our agricultural community
and Madam.
I'll get it straight.
So
This law that you're saying that
the fact that the sat at us.
I thought it was that would
affect your land.
And.
Madam, there's anybody in the
audience that could verify that.
Uh
And then.
I think we can't ask that
question.
Yeah. Is there any one DA?
yeah.
When
So
So are we saying that
The yield won't take you out of
agricultural status.
If you have a yield.
I think I think we're trying to
determine if it exists right
now.
If you have a little lower.
Are you still allowed to keep
your lands
that you can keep it,
so I believe that you have
to lose that. Am I correct,
um, so currently it does
it absolutely
is.
and
um we have some that are
interpreting the current
status and
there is criteria.
You were only allowed to
follow or
have a low yield one so
3 or 5 years adequately,
um, that is, that is
what you and I
were 20 years ago
What
that you will.
Uh
that
if you could do that. We, we
don't know how to do it right
now, uh.
But I would like to see that,
uh.
I know that in the state of
Mexico.
We have suffered drought for
years now.
And
I just don't see farmers.
I, I haven't seen it. I haven't
heard about it.
This is news to me, so.
that
we see each other you could get.
You.
And
Madam,
so I'll go to another question.
So
we're gonna value.
owns.
So that we can that
that does?
No,
no.
So.
they don't have that.
I,
I don't understand how you're
phrasings the question. So, so,
so
does this does this bill
I,
I don't understand how you're
phrasings the question. So, so,
so does this does this
representative yes
OK.
clarifies existing law.
Um, and
if you have a
So you maintain
your status.
The
criteria to revenue
not able to.
And and
and you don't have
the water.
So
Ma.
this bill.
You.
Thank you and thank you the
authority
to
drought
a certain amount of land that
they lose their
repairs.
OK,
thank you for that, Madam.
So.
So when we
farmers
If you
or anything like that.
Because
you can control.
The amount of water that you put
on your.
So the only way you can.
I
Through, through
irrigation.
not.
Why should
has the potential to irrigate
their land.
definition
of drought.
We're we're we're this
definition that
You're in if,
if you're down or
broke down
and, and, and I felt bad for the
people because we've heard about
this.
and
We testimony
About the issues with that with
that section there.
What makes us able to go in and
change the definition.
And how is that gonna affect
policies throughout the state.
If, if, how is that going to
affect our policies.
Right now you
Right.
And if
you're insured you have a
history.
Of what you've been producing
and will insure you your your
history
because he's gonna have.
You get to pay that on your
insurance.
So why, why are we manipulating
all that.
I just just there's there's a
system in place that's working.
And if those farmers are having
problems.
With this one section of the
land.
Why should we change the whole
Mexico, I just don't.
I
I don't understand this.
But I think it could hurt other
people in other parts of the.
Do you,
do you agree that the systems
that are in place.
I.
And, and, and, and, and Adam
sometimes I wonder.
You know, none of us are experts
on one particular thing and
I think sometimes the public
looks to us
as experts
and laws.
But, but
I just think
and hope the committee is
testimony.
And
We take a look at a bill like
this and not.
Not the whole state with
with the issue
that's right here in this
particular area which is
relatively small compared to the
state.
What, what, what, what, what,
what's the outlook on fixing
this system hasn't been fixed in
the past 5 years.
The history.
I would be 45 minute story.
And that is not what this is
this is about and it is this is
not the this area.
I
I just that
that is starting
to move across the state. I do
understand that it may not be an
issue for
family farms.
Thank you,
Madam, thank you Madam. Thank
you, Ramona.
And my came out.
I have a couple of technical
questions and then I want to
move on to.
Partly.
Why are they left out. I'll help
you.
Is it.
I think it's a great question. I
will go back to my.
Um, I, I have been because
there's another.
I don't like
in in
in
um.
I remember there are.
astricts.
So that would mean not including
those that could have access to,
but not all our water use water.
Um, I, I think we've also left
out
in turn besides we don't have it
would be like,
uh, and
and it.
I am.
There are no more.
we have.
The the the
the um and at your gate telling
you where you open up and when
you shut down that are around
with boots and is leaking and
raising it so that is something
that I
appreciate.
more on
um.
I want to talk a little bit
about construction because they
missing
section,
page 3.
some of the questions that our
colleagues have brought up about
the consistency across New
Mexico
as current law,
the department here we were
talking about I'm assuming that
the Department of.
responsible for adopting rules
determining whether or not
totural purposes.
Is that the
RDE?
What's our.
OK, so.
Um,
section and
you can be
Um,
section and
the next I think would would
still through many of these
points.
But specifically when you get to
5.5.
The responsibility to have seen
throughout the state.
So that uniformity is where
you're having questions. I
appreciate the intention. I
understand. I am
are production capacity not have
water
in my.
that is going to depend on the
outcomes of
the US
in Texas and New Mexico are
trying to figure out
what our settles look like when
I think about whether the
I.
small entities
making their own decisions
and then we use the uniform,
now my rights aren't under
consideration the water
up a system where
you could be different from one
to the next, um, so.
I responsibilities.
I think much more comfortable if
it was an entity
like
the bag that was
across the water.
Um
So they'll be,
um, vice chair just my last
question generally is about the
referrals and of course not, uh,
this isn't on our but it is
concerning to the second
referrals
and
um
and then of course as we figured
that out, it is responsible
and he thinks this is.
that
should be carried on in the
taxi.
Thank you, thank you.
Thank
you, madam chair and thank you.
this bill.
I,
I just wanted to address one
thing on page section, that's
already in the statute, yeah, so
that's that's that's not
a change in responsibilities is
to
administer tax code with
uniformity across the state.
It,
it would be in contradiction
with that, so what I'm saying is
that
by allowing conservative
districts.
they are determine the drought
status or something else
and it would district, then
we're contradiction with the
poly.
The, the
General
with unity.
So responsibility is to
determine rules.
to determine whether that is
within that and we have to
address that we will no longer
be able to do that.
So yeah, yeah.
That, that's the I'll move on.
Thank you
And uh uh.
No.
I
I appreciate the questions, uh,
uh,
several of them are very very
specific.
With respect to
tax and
making these decisions,
but then.
Uh,
the authority to the
winds up with 477.
Different
Servants district pardon me,
um, to write our own rules.
And then their own
completely unfunded.
Um, and that
that will create.
exists.
I,
um.
problem
questions
with respect to the
law.
And
back to work.
and expert Martin.
next to you.
As you should be able to.
from the
for you.
And,
uh,
the disclaimer.
At the end of the day.
You were the writer of the.
How affects.
from a standpoint.
Because you should be details
on statute, not opinion.
Yeah
Absolutely,
uh.
The way that I understand this
this sections.
for purposes
And
so what changes.
to
The authorities that can
designate a drought moderate.
And is used for
the purpose of determining their
use.
property
Uh.
And so
it
is
You know
If
we have all these.
Under.
Her.
not
the production of the products
that normally
because of the conditions and
then.
and water.
And so there isn't yield.
To be determined
to land,
but in the past,
the year was
and then they can
um.
Thank you, thank you Martin for
that.
I will say that with each other.
In the very very beginning part
of what you talk about whether
or not a piece of land.
And then
Martin to
Um,
statute about a few other pieces
of that.
I'm trying to get at is
we look at this as whether or
not
PC property should not say.
dough.
Which is a very
well monitored agreement with
respect to what that
that status.
Um
Let's look at the reverse side.
And I
reached out to a few across the
state.
And I
actually have situations
where ours are wanting to go in
was
producing one last year.
And
the drought the ability to
remove the drought.
several different ones.
After this because their income.
Is
that actually attempting to
increase their property tax.
Input to their county
Within that that creates some
sort of problem.
We are.
With what we're doing here.
We're trying to move it to the
district and we had a few.
in opposition to this.
Um
We ask them
to come in and make decisions.
With the preempt the
requirements.
And
That should be in the room.
We have, we have, we have in
place.
University.
some of these issues
The
2 on page 3 that
in Mexico districts
inside law to achieve this.
What's that.
Maybe
we rely on on
and
on
about this.
Just the side of the state we're
still.
engineers that
that do
properties for
um required to do water
analysis.
Or you know, you know, let's
let's look.
Let's.
And
that way we're required to do
water evaluation. Unfortunately.
doesn't.
calculate.
What water is for instance.
one.
I remember, I remember
a long one.
Whether or not.
So I I struggled with the intent
of this
and I question whether or not.
The intent
This is truly to be able to get
to keep
something in an exemption.
Or give give to our stors to get
it out of
property within the state.
Or within the county.
I think there's enough
information.
Between
All the documents
that actually contain.
You also have
You know, uh, you know, you
know, um, there's, there's
carrot and stick.
I think the stick is the carrot.
of us right now
and
we're
so different.
Different contingency.
$1.
And that creates a problem for
me. We have
Really
inside
Really
inside
of definitions us an explanation
on
um
whether or not this would
improve
our capability versus the
negative impact it would have on
land agents,
um.
If, if I want to insure my
property.
has the ability to.
The, the impact on the
landowners is significant.
And that creates a problem for
me.
The consequences of this.
are
Really, really, really
significant
and I can continue, I think
we've heard from both sides of
that
may be something that we need to
do.
This is get it done.
Thank you.
OK.
Did, did
Thank you and thank
you.
I just had a question based on
that for her.
I
It.
Based on agriculture and,
um, you know, I can't.
Um, presumably stand.
Um, I, I, I question as well and
because it was referred to them.
I would strongly um support any
efforts to change.
Um,
but it had it.
that
And then if, if
we,
um,
you, you, you had talked to you.
I, I,
And then if, if we,
um,
you, you, you had talked to you.
I'm I'm not part of that
for you
real quickly.
Real real quick.
Yes.
This is just about the agency of
department it does look like
as per usual procedure at the
community, whoever it is for the
legislature. That is completely
separate from the processes
that revenue
for an analysis that they did
not provide that doesn't have to
do with the mama.
Matthews.
Thank you. uh
and.
Um
local government.
And,
but then underestimated

It says that the fund.
And

I I I don't.
To avoid your question uh I
certainly is a very good
question.
I just.

Thank you very much. I'm here
to present
Thank you very much. I'm here to

Um, uh,
and 24 we um all of our.
Um,
uh, as you know, we,
uh, letting us know that we have
2 to 25% in 50 years.
So something that we are always
looking at,
um, and I know this is the
leader and his efforts
to make sure that we are
managing um our water.
Um,
80%
of our water is used by the
community and so we tend to look
at agricultural community
conservation
uh for you I believe
um.
other communities to also.
It is requiring all state owned
or state funded buildings
that have nonfunctional.
That are not using recycle
water.
Um, get get rid of their
nonfunctional.
landscaping.
Obviously all of the university
systems are
turf on university grounds.
Um, any, um, any, any function
such as soccer fields and
and uh you know you know play
playgrounds or
uh school function
such as soccer fields and
and uh you know you know play
playgrounds or
uh school functional
we are trying to aim at the
little
little grass around.
Residential and commercial
property
and nonfunctional.
Thank
you.
Thank
you and those who opposed.
We're gonna go
for one minute on record.
coming your way.
Uh
Good morning

that
Good morning
and spoke with about uh
ensuring consistent with
promoting and uh so happy that
I some
some questions from public
education and
I think in general um.
I think Services
but uh.
Good morning. Morning.
My name is Beni.
We work with providers
throughout the West to expand

Any more comments?
Thank you Madam in Mexico
districts
like this.
Says
it. Thank you, thank you.
That public comments.
Uh, uh
Good
morning Madam Chair, um, and I'm
one of the things I want to say
is one of the first things I do
do I moved to the state of
Mexico 30 years ago
and I'm really proud that I did
that. I'm not wasting all that
water
that I blowing sprinklers that
have that have um that have,
uh, you know, grass.
and I'm really happy that our
government will be um
we'll be leading the way and
showing us how are.
the.
My
Ma'am, ma'am, can you state your
name for the right record
Thank you. We're gonna move to
the committee for questions.
Uh. Thank you, Madam. Thank you.
This is
the entity
that is going to monitor, um,
like, like, um.
What what who's if they're
they're following this what what
what what is actually gonna be
the agenda. I don't see that in
here.
Uh, I think that that
is gonna be because there will
be so.
To.
Um, it is, it is,
um I would also.
be,
um, um, Madam Madam Chair in
that states that specific thing
like who's in charge of making
rules that kind of stuff. I
don't I don't see it in your but
I
No, it doesn't. Thank you, thank
you my manager.
OK, um.
Now this is a representative
this is um.
so we have a choice.
Um and
Um
um.
that includes all the.
The correct.
Thank you and thanks to all
properties, schools are
funded by the state,
you have a
field
for recreational purposes
to be changed.
Um, thank you, um,
do you have any idea of what
I mean, I understand that um
recreational stuff is exempt and
there are many
across the schools that that
what you're talking about
decoration type of stuff. Do we
have any idea of what it is that
that is going to cost.
The
school district
I mean for me that
that's so, so I know the very
very limited amount of money and
it's able to get that um
that
money to the schools and um many
places for that.
So do you have do you have any
idea how much it's gonna cost.
Just specifically.
I
I think my school
and also to
I I think my school also.
So um so those would be a cost,
um.
Expense
they would have to do
individually requires
I understand um that
you think that
that's you know reality is we
have schools that can't because
of the process,
so I I don't I don't think you
understand the the the way that
money functions in the school
system
and now that they that it is an
extra cost for all who
don't have the resources that we
need in order to be doing things
we're doing now.
But now you're adding them to do
something else. Um, so that,
that alone I have um issue with
this because again our
our systems and process
for schools is um it's it's
crazy like I said we we have old
schools can't get replaced
because of because of the being
able to not being able to match
um what
what they're they're supposed
to.
So, um, so.
I can't support this because of
the it's it's.
It's a system that is
sing every dollar they possibly
can.
Um,
sorry.
And.
Thank you.
Um.
there is there is no mandate
if you
are replacing,
um, that's not.
And, um, and then I will, and
what we have done is depending
on what kind of kind of,
um, you can actually.
I,
I, I prefer eating
so.
I'm, I'm gonna take down the
road.
Um
If I fight with the definition
owned property.
construction.
Rebuild.
We are required to.
And we are required
and to um
cover in such a way withdraw or
or um
A chemical way to make that.
This law does not exempt the
DAT.
The rule I complete question,
Madam Chair before you go.
I want to. Yeah.
A state.
company.
right.
You have to go back and do the
same thing.
You just increased.
The
construction right away.
And.
I'm giving you in the background
I can go to that definition of
her.
I can I can bring up the
details.
And then the potential all
agree.
The legislature doesn't get to
review.
So whoever's the right whatever
they want.
We've got examples of
We've got that
down.
legislation
And then in the department came
in.
They bypass.
arms.
I give
you.
go through that.
With the base definition of what
I have to do with respect to
designing road.
Bridges.
Uh.
and put back in.
Actually falls under the
concept.
Of
feeding,
which is violating
property.
cost
Would be exponential
love.
Thank you and thank you
So you are correct in
our
lands,
yes it will.
not,
Um,
it does not require you to go.
there are areas.
That are irritated.
And uh not
not necessarily that does change
the impact of those
would be design projects that
are in
that process.
The same thing
on land.
Where
The state has given easement
through a piece of property
leased out by
former or.
by the state.
Now you're saying no, it has to
be.
and thank you
that land,
and thank you
that lands,
horses or
doing whatever it is it is a
patch of DOT
and uh I I it is yes this will
require them to,
highways.
it looks like grass Mexico
Mexico
that
that would require that.
would
bring it up because I do
understand and
we do not have the spot.
from.
And um.
Don't don't know
from the I couldn't.
So it's things that concern me
when I look at the impact
of this conflict with.
Just the opposite.
So, um,
There are questions and problems
are much the same as the
problems that
and then 20202024.
I'm not gonna get
those
singing for.
Um
I don't think ready for this.
And um,
truly.
concerned.
We don't know.
And.
Thank you.

OK. Thank you, Madam. I,
um, where indigenous

um, as in the test and um
to address public health and
environmental concerns.
Um,
we believe legislation in places
like
we're witnessing the adverse
impacts to public health and
environment and sacred sites
that are important to indigenous
communities,
um, and especially during such
time and gas development is very
cent to the new presidential
administration.
Uh, we need our state to take
action to protections for
frontline communities
and future generations. Thank
you.

I'll be brief. I just want to
say, um, my name is Alejandria
Lyons. Um, I support the bill.
Many of our um coalition is here
and I just want to thank the
representative for your work,
um, and please thank you all to
help us get this um rule passed,
Thank you
Um, jurisdiction over these,
these issues already, but I want
to point you to two things based
on Ms. Evans' testimony. Miss
Evans said the OCD would have
the authority to consider.
Um
Public health and the
environment. It's actually a
mandate to to the division cause
it said the division shall
consider.
and protect public health and
the environment. So it's not a
way that it gives them an
option. And the other thing I
would refer you to is she talked
about buffer zones or setbacks
in rule.
You might recall that we've had
a couple of discussions
legislatively about setbacks of
the past past couple of
sessions, we're likely to have
those discussions again. We
appreciate the sponsor she met
with us over the interim. We had
a good discussion. We didn't
agree necessarily on the
outcome, but we think setbacks
is serious enough that that
should be considered by the
legislature and not deferred to
rulemaking by a state agency. We
think that's what's in your
purview and urge you to keep it
there. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee. My name is JD
Bullington, and I'm speaking to
you today on behalf of the
Greater Albuquerque Chamber of
Commerce, um, the chamber
members, of course, want clean
air and water and the
environment protected for
generations to come at the
greater Albuquerque Chamber of
Commerce favors clearly defined
regulations that provide
specific guidance instead of the
approach being taken with House
Bill 34. The bill is obviously
well-intentioned, however, the
chamber believes this bill
expands the responsibilities of
the oil conservation.
Division in a manner that is too
broad and too vague, although I
will say I do appreciate the
explanation from the sponsors
about some of the ambiguities
and lack of definitions in the
bill. Um, however, we believe or
the chamber believes that House
Bill 34 unnecessarily will
duplicate work that's already
being done by the Air Quality
Bureau and the New Mexico
Department of Environment.
Thank you.
Thank you, Chair, members of the
committee. My name is Alison
Riley, public policy director
for the New Mexico Chamber of
Commerce. I'm here to express
our opposition to House Bill 34.
We support reasonable efforts to
protect public health and the
environment, and we're on track
to meet the governor's 2025
climate goals. However, we're
concerned with this bill for a
couple of reasons. The first is
when you don't define terms like
health and environment, that
creates uncertainty for
businesses, and it risks
inconsistent enforcement and
unpredictable compliance
requirements, which undermines a
business's ability.
The plan for the future. Second,
the bill duplicates existing
efforts, and businesses in New
Mexico are working very
diligently to comply with the
EPA regulators and laying a
state level on top of that will
create confusion and
inefficiency.
Finally, the bill constitutes an
unfunded mandate imposing a cost
on state agencies without
providing the necessary funding
and support for compliance.
We urge the committee to
reconsider this approach and
work towards solutions that are
funded and feasible for
businesses that drive New
Mexico's economy and vote no on
this bill. Thank you. Thank you.
Hey, anyone else in the room?
More.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is TJ Truri.
I'm a registered lobbyist and
we'll be speaking to you today
on behalf of Occidental
Petroleum and enduring
resources, um.
I'm not gonna repeat what other
uh individuals said. I will tell
you that the fundamental problem
with this bill, uh, is the
difference between like a, a
general grant of authority
versus a specific grant of
authority.
The language that it looks like
a very simple bill with just a
few words added, there's
existing language also that
talks about what needs to be
protected, those existing
languages, there's a whole
statutory scheme in the oil and
gas Act that talks about what
needs to be done to deal with
waste and.
Correlative rights
The new language, there's zero
guidance.
Oil and Gas Act. That's what,
that's what the problem is, uh,
in addition to the duplicative
regulatory schemes that others
have talked about.
Thank you members of the
committee.
Thank you so much. Now we'll
move to the Zoom, we have, I
think one person on.
Jim Winchester.
Thank you. Is there any other
public comment?
We'll go back to the sponsor. Do
you have
You know
that you can.
Um, my, uh, expert.
Just briefly, thank you Madam
Chair and members of the
committee. Um, first of all, I
believe Mr. Haran was reading
from a prior bill and doesn't
have the committee sub in front
of him, um, and there was
confusion with the word shall
that was in a prior bill.
Have a committee.
I thought this stuff had been
sent out.
Are we, let's, can we read out
your committee sub to make sure
that we can pass you a copy of
it the 202 number at the bottom.
It says, um,
Section A, the division is here
oh I'm sorry, 230080.1. Yeah, we
don't, we don't have that, we
don't have that. Um, no, it's
too late.
We can't hear them because we,
nobody saw.
It's just not possible to, to
vote on this bill right now and
hear this.
Madam Chair, I have a question.
So
Means that we have sat here and
listened to the wrong bill all
morning.
What would, what's gonna be the
correct motion to
We're gonna move to table this
bill that we just listened to.
How can we roll the bill if this
isn't the actual bill that, that
was reg.
But we did hear a bill, and, and
it was in committee.
And this is the original bill.
Representative, uh, Zamora,
we're not going to roll this
bill. We're going, we're not
going to table this bill. We're
gonna roll this bill till
Thursday, and I have, I deeply
apologize to Representative
Sareana.
Uh, I, I, I thought it made the
binder. I thought that we were
reviewing the, the proper bill.
We will have to
Hear this bill again. No.
Madam Chair, just one question.
Can I have the committee
substitute 202 number?
Like.
Go ahead, it's 230,080?
Point 230080.1. It does not
change the meaning of the bill.
It just clarified. Yeah, we
can't roll.
A 229297.
It is now a 230,080.
That's
not possible Pettigrew, we are
going to hear
The bill that was just read, and
we will assemble again on
Thursday. We'll get everybody a
copy of the committee sub so
that we can review that.
All at the same time, we will
all have copies of that, Madam
Chair.

And um chair or.
No table.
Uh, that here to the proper.
Madam Chair, I have a question.
Madam Chair, so will that be a
New bill introduced in or how,
how is that gonna work?
No, it's just a committee
substitute.
Because we already voted on this
bill.
We heard public testimony on a
version of
uh, that tabling motion failed,
so we're not gonna vote on this
bill.
We're going to hear the
We will not do public comment
again. We will go right into
questions from the committee for
the committee substitute for HD
34. That's what we will do on
Thursday morning. Thank you.
I don't know. Um, this meeting
is adjourned.
We will reconvene again on
Thursday.
