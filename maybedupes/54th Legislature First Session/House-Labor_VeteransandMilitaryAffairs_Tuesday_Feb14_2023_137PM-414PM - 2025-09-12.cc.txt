Representative Martinez.
Representative right here
Representative get us your.
Representative incentive here.
By two.
Affected chair going you.
Eight.
So Representative do you.
Representative.
One of those days okay.
Except the as of here.
Okay.
Okay.
Thanks for the by the way Mr
chairman before we start you
have no idea how much do we love
you.
In the hot seat you are ready.
We.
We know that.
I am pleased to bring to you
house bill one fifty one which
is a field that allows
eligibility for them.
For unemployment to not hit your
car faculty at the university.
It's a very simple does it just
helps these folks who are
working.
The agency
to try to continue to access
because there is a place between
sessions and they have no other
source of income to get the
employees have access to
unemployment so this bill will
help access.
To my left is my of extra this
Mr Shane you and I will do for
him as we begin Mr.
Chairman members of the
committee at the bill
essentially modernizes New
Mexico that employs staff from
the federal law and the rules
have created a situation so that
had just professors can collect
unemployment between terms in in
the eligible for that there has
been a amazing shift in
America's colleges and the
university of New Mexico are
called systems have followed
suit and that changes that.
Messrs tenured professors no
longer classes at our
universities there primarily
taught by.
Professors but they're they're
they don't they're not on the
tenure track this bill in
conformance with federal law
would make them eligible for
unemployment during the pre for
example in the summer with it
where they have a reasonable
expectation of re employment
offers them that opportunity my
understanding is that the
University of New Mexico and the
other colleges are in favor and
have endorsed disability it
provides a budget that is there
the language of the bill simply
adopts federal rules into the
New Mexico unemployment.
Mr chair Senator.
All right.
I will go to the audience is
there anybody in support of this
legislation.
Everybody in offices provided
the.
Of those to the.
Screen over here is in the in
support of this deal on this.
Is there anybody in opposition.
The.
As a those include support that
want to speak up.
The front in the back going to
this.
Very to me if you are.
Think of those opportunities Mr
chair just about see I just I
the challenging also these with
the faculty for the at job
circular country New York Texas
human them for about seven years
trying to find preposition and
so I'm the poster child of this
right now on this point.
Because I was for for for the
state legislature that was the.
But we are the need for many
years to come check us lease
which I will keep you full time
but I don't I mean I'm getting
rental assistance on getting
unemployment the other component
is.
In terms of the quality of the
education that students are
getting into Mexico provides
benefit you're gonna alleviate a
lot of people hundreds of people
from worries stresses.
Postmasters disorder maybe and
providing them with benefits
that they would think they're
not getting out like myself
which I'm very fortunate I.
This is because well in many
cases I come from a family that
my constructs Mr for voting
rights activist and one of the
local decisions these this is
the other components you're
getting quality educators like
myself that are making the
sacrifices to do that.
Thank you for your time thank
you.
This is.
Chairman members of the
committee.
I'm sure.
Department if you an opportunity
also representative of to a UNM
are back to you.
I started my teaching career in
one thousand.
Ten years ago I was assigned to
teach generalities fall
semesters very excited this
opportunity and I was told that
I was going to be able to teach
it again in the spring.
Within days of spring semester
starting the course that I was
expected to teach and given to
another full time faculty member
there was nothing for me to
teach.
It was too late for me to find
another job and I was unemployed
that's right.
This was a stressful time for me
I was trying to start my career
I have no children at home I was
worried about our financial
stability.
This story is all too common in
higher at it's not just my store
this is a very common story
alright how does have little to
no job security and this kind of
plan that they'll we help buffer
the effects of that uncertainty.
We strongly support the self
and.
That our legislators are
recognizing the need to protect
our address in higher ed and we
thank you for your support.
Next yes.
You Mr chairman members calling
president New Mexico I think in
terms of what is the reality.
Representative apple
verification and this
legislation is a necessary
perspectives on the respect you
deserve thank you thank you
else.
Yes.
The committee members with the
Representative Munoz.
Oh oh sorry well there is
somebody on I thought that was
what it okay I am one hand up
there live chat.
Thank you Mr okay thank you Mr
chairman members of the
committee John the feuds with
The New Mexico federation of
labor are we stand in strong
support of this measure we
certainly believe that all all
workers should have the right to
unemployment certainly those
that the lake are adjunct
professors who have put in so
much work educating our students
and have to deal with
uncertainty in the workplace
they certainly deserve this
right so for all the reasons
stated previously once again we
stand in strong support of the
measure thank you.
But.
It they were the.
Okay members of the committee
representing Munoz.
Thank you Mr chair
representative thank you for
bringing this forward.
On.
My first question.
Percent of why they're not
getting unemployment benefits or
whether you all for now why.
Is there a reason why Mr
chairman for twenty.
Chairman representative Martinez
that the short answer is that
that that the statue is not
really a way to allow them to
collect unemployment because
they may be employed the next
semester or they may not be
employees next semester in the
language that we have proposed
clarifies the law in terms of
what we work under what
conditions they would be.
And there there there is that
many many states happen
under federal law in this
legislation language proposed
resolved that that used to exist
in our state.
Mr chair representative.
For a long time of I think one
of the conveniences for give up
institutions of higher learning
as you already know.
If they hire non tenure track of
non tenured faculty they don't
have to pay.
They don't have to pay insurance
and all those things and it's
become one of the issues that
creates problems and actually
start mission wages and
starvation issues for these not
that you know sometimes employed
sometimes unemployed faculty and
I think this which is why we've
got the support of all the
University.
They recognize
the error of their ways.
Stood up and supported my
previous committee and.
To support no it's.
They did the error.
Sure Representative is that what
is as workforce solutions taking
a stab yes this.
Chair representative or is.
So the more the newly appointed
chair and spoke.
Thank you this is something and
then the committee I don't
believe that she could be here.
Mr chair
Senator also he's testifying.
He would be here if she were.
Mr chair representative.
I think the I think the concept
is a great concept.
Makes sense.
But here's the problem that I.
Thanks.
What
six seven.
The special line seven point as
that is written or or implied.
A lot of promises for leave
that.
Been.
Did not.
I like the red ones if I have
been writing somebody's name to
it I can take that anywhere in
the state.
This is the office.
Mr chair
representative I I have a
problem with the world for
employees.
To me that's just a statement
following.
You just hang your hat on
something for drugs or and I
promise because what I think is
implied maybe very differently
different from what you think is
and.
Mr chair representative somebody
the details we you'd be great
for this job I walked away
thinking implications that one
work actual like.
Full.
Two words.
Really.
All those.
Like I said Mr chair.
Representative I think the
concept is a great point.
For me it's make sense.
Those two are going to cause
problems if this bill passes
signed into law.
We're gonna have to defend those
words Mr Chairman representative
Martinez may respond please do
that's why I have made some
great witness because we
responded to this question.
This committee.
The answer that people.
Sharon Representative Martinez
it it's for questioning don't
certainly like happen like that
in staff.
This that the language itself is
far from federal regulations and
the reason that it needs to be
in the statutes to go first the
nature of the relationships
between the universities and the
agent professor are accurately
right here they're not always
right sometimes their oral
agreement sometimes their plight
remains in the standard
reasonable assurances the
standard by which they determine
whether or not coverage is
provided to individual what what
we have now in the statute is
the phrase reasonable assurance.
Which is it is part of a seven
for eight we have no definition
or explanation of what
constitutes reasonable insurance
assurance so what we have done
is we have borrowed from that
the federal regulations and
inserted this language in there
I would prefer that it not be in
there but unfortunately because
of the need to point
relationships between our
universities and are at gentle
festers it has to be in there to
ensure that there is full
coverage for unemployment in the
act.
Mr chair representative with all
due respect to your expert on
maybe a twenty five year career.
All fighting the federal
government.
Exactly like this.
What I will do it K. for veteran
before the VA.
I would say that this when they.
The low point four pool from
the.
On I am I am not comfortable
with this language the concept.
I am all for.
I will I will listen to the rest
of the debate Mr chair
representative but.
I really have issues and and to
on this with the federal
government says.
Federal government is a lot of
these Mr chair Senator
skepticism would suggest.
The way it is now.
Obviously the.
Some of the one thank you Mr
thank.
Chair representative again thank
you for that makes sense to me
the concept.
All listen to the rest of the
city.
but I I'm.
Really have all that.
The roof.
Thank you Mr chair and
representative so I I did as
best actually was for the last
three years
and so I'm kind of understand it
a little bit what you're saying
and I'm just trying to wrap my
head around the so I don't know
if this is how it is for all all
universities are community
colleges or whatever so I wasn't
education for us from a lot of
on line and the every.
Like the semester before.
Contacted and say we need to use
you know law whatever whatever
question is this a like a book
you know for them to rules they
can see it's me so I I see a
sense that you you are talking
about your next semester pretty
early and it is preset styles
because people are taking
classes obviously the semester
before so I think I see a little
bit of that but can you tell me
like what percentage
of your ads are professors
across the state are not
employed any other way what
doesn't cause I guess if an
officer fired a little bit Mr
chair representative I had this
is a obviously I did it because
I love to do it was a part time
gig for me except one or two
classes semester and that was
pretty much the equivalent of
every action professor did want
to classes yet they had outside
professions so when it came to
the summer or whatever it wasn't
so much the issue so how many
people are talking about that
are fully in no other form or
fashion but the statute.
Mr chairman and for.
I don't have those.
boxes but maybe alright what
surprising news.
Of the secretaries of their the
question was do we have any
numbers for unemployed
In the state.
Correct and.
Madam chair representative Mr
chair side of any additions
my question was is I I was not
just for certain when you walked
in so basically most of that are
professors that I worked with
literally just pop one or two
classes a semester and had
other.
the it wasn't so much an issue
such trying to get a number of
how many people of the state
actually our abject professors
at the universities with no
other employment with our.
Here Representative.
Do
you identify yourself please for
the.
She is brand spanking new immune
to shiny new.
of share Calhoun have members of
the committee answer required
the secretary for department of
workforce solutions nine years
started burning.
I have my I. T. we do not have
numbers on that and I think
there might it might be a little
bit cyclical in the sensor to
circular problem.
In this bill is that people to
part because of these I'm here
requirements the University Park
in better position to happen.
Okay Mister chair representative
so what we're basically trying
to do is is open for when the
summer rolls around or are they
basically at magic professor
doesn't get the.
Opportunity for a job the next
semester that they would get.
That is my understanding
correctly
basically so and with all due
respect Mr chairman
my expert witness just stated
that University of New Mexico
fifty two percent of the
instructional staff is
contingents that I'm not sure
about other universities.
Mr chair representative thank
you that so that's a lot of
people I guess of that.
I guess part of the problem I
have is when you do take these
type of jobs you know hope that
you basically are going to
probably be working in the
summer and let's see bandwidth
institution quite a while and
the guy was needed for three
years to two classes in the
spring classes in the fall after
getting the money and
and so as.
Yeah I just I start with the
just because I've done I do
understand what you're saying
about the previous semester and
that was how my contracts work I
did sign a written contract
until I actually started
teaching my classes they go in
and sign a written contract I
was process classes and I saw
them on the in the lot the book
basically so I understand that a
little bit more I think.
But okay thank you that question
thank you Mr chair.
Something.
Many of them.
The.
So you hide you know I always
budget Mr chair.
So.
Thank you for bringing this I
mean the the intent is is nice
to hear what trying to.
But let me ask some questions
here and I'm sorry Mr chair
representative what what is it
that I think catcher your
position or what you do
Representative sorry Chairman
representative taxes I'm a
lawyer here in Albuquerque New
Mexico have as practiced
employment law for over thirty
years Representative labor
unions Representative ploys in
context and.
Have become familiar with that
labor employment laws in Mexico
today.
Thank you Mr chair
representative so my question of
would be Mr chair
so this add some professors to
the root are they do they
receive.
The W. two ten ninety nine.
Jacquelyn back Representative
**** I don't know the answer to
that question I have no clue
what form I would expect any
soon that they received up to
yes formal.
Both.
Representative said generally
what happens is at jumpers
compressors and like other jobs
throughout
the state.
The intro.
Representative before long.
When that they're contracted
positions rather than full time
employees would that be correct
chair representative traffic on
that Representative says that is
very date date sign employment
contracts and our employees.
So the defined that's the thing
Mr chair representative in your
you know this
They would normally get a ten
ninety nine in the from my
experience I could be wrong but
I think that's what the receive
because technically
Representative
they're not employees.
This consider that they're
employed there but there is a
special class because it
contracted for specific time.
Is that right Mr chair
representative.
Chairman Representative **** I
would respectfully disagree I
they are considered as employees
and as I just assumed they
receive W. twos so they are boys
rather than independent
contractors which is what would
necessarily in that order and so
Mister chair representative of
them but that's a case of want
to clearly explain to me why
they're not getting
unemployment.
So the question.
Chair of the Representative ****
is right now we have the
employment laws which require
there be reasonable assurance
that ambiguity has created
uncertainty as to whether or not
the act professor qualify for
unemployment for example over
the summer camp because the
language doesn't have any
specificity as to what
constitutes reconstitute
treasonable assurance I believe
that some of these claims have
been denied because the language
there doesn't support that the
employment relationship that
currently exists that didn't
formally.
The language that we have
inserted to define and specify
what constitutes reasonable
insurance provides them with
that those guideposts so that
the unemployment department can
find unemployment insurance
coverage under the standards set
out in reasonable assurance in
the language in the proposed
legislation so Mister chair
representative.
that I think that.
Are based here you're gonna find
on this bill I think Madam.
Yes.
Thank you Mr chairman.
So there's no set clear of
anything patterns so you can't
log and jumped teaching
assistants for anyone this non
tenure track you can't look at
any particular pattern because
each one this is generated
differently by the time that's
been part of what the problems
are so some individuals Mr chair
representative received ten
eighty eight which are
particularly teaching assistants
right graduate assistants others
received after the two which is
of comparable to whatever their
particular work status is so
I just wanted to clarify you we
can't make those kinds of
assumptions in this particular
case because everything is going
to be different depending on how
your particular higher
department and you have entered
into and it's also common
practice there the the written
oral or implied.
Of the work
For work agreement depending on
how it goes I just thought I'd
let you know for sure there
there.
Ten ninety eight and W. twos
most cases so.
Thank I think I attempted and
that'll levels okay with that
so.
The condenser Mr chair
representative of what of what
we're I'm going with that
agreements the reason that you
see all these different
treatments is because they're
hired under different
contractual agreements otherwise
it be all held under the same
standard but that be true Mr
chair representative.
There Mr chairman and members of
the committee I'm not going to
speculate going to okay.
Defer to my sure.
Mr chair representative for us
we just question so that the
questions chair representative
who is and I'm sorry to use for
use is in publishing K. J. how
are all these contracts the same
but we rephrase the question Mr
chair representative assets of
course not okay so.
Back to work out what what I was
trying to say is are not the
same so they can't fall that's
why that's why you have this
this is not a discrepancy there
read more how the contract was
put together that makes sense Mr
chair representative of course
they contract in this matter so
falls under this category or
doesn't and that's part of the
problem that we're that you're
having is that's why you don't
have there's no uniformity
because the contract itself of
the wage right now there's no
doubt of that position on.
Make sure that it is on.
Mr chairman.
That particular fact there with
the.
They give a in order here if you
have somebody that that's going
to get us in ninety nine there
are self employed.
Some of the if you're self
employed you know get on.
Okay as you get it doesn't do
for them to get a.
So how the contract the those
are doesn't go doesn't matter
what matters is we're trying to
take care of those proposed
student Domingo's teachers that
are hired by the university's.
Under a salary that the a W. to
add which the university pays
unemployment compensation the
state that insurance portion of
your deductions on your checks
so we're not worried about it in
ninety nine we're worried about
the person that is employed by
the university to teach under
contract that is going to get a
salary and is the debate.
The numbers will be additional
security taxes of three years of
everything else.
So that's what we're talking
about this gonna what did not
share all is good because that
point of order Mr chair.
Order you're looking for the
ability to transfer up to the
committee thank you so much I'm
trying to explain to you the
field about.
Mr chair it was above and beyond
to be applicable to the self
employed here the self employed
I'm trying to figure out it's
not they're not all the way to
go ahead with the.
It's so I'm just gonna go out I
was trying to navigate through
the site make a good decision
and there as a co chair said Mr
chair representative some people
are not received W. two is not
everyone receives ability to
some get to ladies which set so
they're not under the same
category.
and there isn't
There isn't a real.
I guess reasonable assurances
part ways there's no exact
office as opposed to be exactly
the way things are are formally
this is why susceptible to a to
a employment judge Mr chair
representative to to assess that
and determine that is that true.
The chair cone Representative
**** I tend to agree with your
outcome with regard to how this
question falls down.
If you are an independent
contractor not eligible for if
you are an employee you are
eligible for unemployment this
bill is directed at only those
persons who would be eligible
for unemployment as a W. two
employee I I just I expected
there there does exist at job
professors to operate as
independent contractors but I
would say that that would be the
outlier because they qualify
generally speaking as an
employee because they they they
have to be at a certain place at
a certain time and therefore
wouldn't qualify as an
independent contractor under a
flood it that is not even the
subject of this legislation.
Representative to understand
that would be through it so
please please I'm not trying to
be roughly because I'm just
trying to understand because of
contractual things interested
can have a bearing on what how
unemployment's rate and that's
most likely what's happening
here so Mr chair representative
so doesn't can you tell me have
how do the universities are all
the universities lined up at
this cause might might receive
definitely
I don't have an answer from them
but I would think they would be
concerned with how this would
affect the budget Mr chair
representative Mr chairman and
members of the committee in our
previous.
Mr most of it represents all the
universities stood up and
confirmed that all the
universities are behind this.
so.
I look at my
And I texted my president the
the present from my university
and he
he respond Mr chair
representative of the sort
customer two hundred four
million dollars for unfunded
mandate on his universe on my
little small university small
okay so I'm getting the strictly
for my for my for my president
so that's what worries me is
some of the
Mr chair representative is it
does affect their budgets I mean
it does affect their budget.
On another note Mr chairman we
consider back and forth Ingle
weather's W. two I don't want to
automatically.
Usually gets unemployment I
don't know all the details of
these contracts I can't answer
to that Mr chair representative
but that's generally what
happens is that as long as they.
We want to certain circumstances
are going to receive a time
something's get a a fall out of
that out of that category but
but on another note.
I just I think what some of the
other representatives were
thank.
I always want to help someone Mr
chair representative.
But in my whole life I've been
out of work two weeks now so I
move from from Silvercity to
college in Dallas.
And so
I always I feel that we also
have a responsibility to fill in
those those those countries
especially when you know we're
gonna have time to time off
I think it's important I think
that's important I just like you
we've okay
and so that's very important for
me to see that you know we're
trying to to fill in those those
gaps with the
I do have my biggest problem is
where I was going with some of
this was I knew that there was
gonna be a problem I University
just just contact me text me
because I know that it would
because of those highly probable
that would cause an unfunded
mandate on the university and so
and and so that's that's really
my problem.
I do have an issue also with
what is Representative said of
the uncertainty of the language
in defining verbal whatever
level.
I can Mr chair.
Thank you Mr chair.
Representative.
I as well as for universities
for our I have twenty.
And the.
Most of the people that I talked
with.
That we're going to do a
contractual.
The job.
Usually did as a second job.
Never as a full time position
and I don't even think it's
intended to be a full time
position from that and
Mr chair representative.
You know everyone was was
Representative are also says is
I've been reading about a
particular university.
That is.
Kind of in a bad way as far as
as money goes and I think that
it would be a huge impact of
that particular university as
well and.
Is it a common is it a common Mr
chair representative of COVID
standard for us to.
For a university get to give a
W. two.
Four of ten ninety eight Mr
chair is yes I doubt that they
could just work with.
without any kind of information
that is that show that they have
to tax their employment but I
just want to go back to the FIR
is a specific there's a specific
Paragraph that says.
Regarding.
Regarding the.
Issue for you and the cost to
the universities it is.
That all of universities that
have a good costs that's
student.
Of.
Cities are within the
representative of they all stood
up in support of this because it
recognizes that it's a
reasonable of cost to their
universities.
It is on page two of the FY FY
are this is to the extent spill
result in additional placements
receiving unemployment benefits
educational institutions that
there unemployment insurance
assistance will bear the fiscal
impact as well the state's self
insurance unemployment
compensation retention Fund at
the present time the budget
appears to have sufficient
assets to cover increases
replace expenditures next year
FY I for FY twenty five schools
the premium assessments adjusted
based on actual playing creams
expenditures the the goal here
is that.
Not everybody's going to be in
the same situation what we're
doing is trying to rectify an
issue of employment so these
folks are con artists we.
Paid to work with the budget or
I need some kind of unemployment
support because up there within
of sessions to the college
that's all it is it's not to
kind of take money it's not to
do with those things of this.
By the way the law to make sure
that they have.
Reasonable sure.
To get employed that that just
have some kind of a.
Which is
Mr chair representative would it
be fair to say that going into a
contract school job.
That there's not a whole lot of
stability there is you know
you're going into a contract
with job.
Mr chair.
Terrakom Representative into
the.
Educational community has in the
last generation been turned up
today.
People who wanted to be
professors took the rap F. as
becoming a professor becoming a
tenured professor America's
colleges and universities have
largely abandoned that system in
the NMAA and so what we have is
even in New Mexico thousands of
people who are looking for
tenured positions but may have
to wait five ten fifteen years
teaching full time as an adjunct
professor for the that offers
the to take a spot that is a ten
years slide the bill provides
them with unemployment insurance
during those periods it's just
reflective of our change change
Kanemi of education in the
United States thank you Mr.
I mean chair representative.
So all I want to give you the.
If I go to a college like my my
college and I work for eight
weeks was that look like.
So I go in there and often I'm
offered a job and I work for
eight weeks.
Then how does it look whenever
at I don't get picked up the
next eight weeks chair upon
Representative it's eight with
all due respect the hype that is
being completely do you have
another job are you eligible for
unemployment otherwise what is
your work history which would
and and.
The staff there would have a
better answer this question but
there's a number of variables to
determine whether or not you
would collect unemployment
insurance this bill would simply
make you eligible if you are
eligible under a that other
circumstances where is now and
may not.
Okay Mister chair let me let me
pull that back around so say I
will I don't have another job
and I want to work for the
university and I want to work
full time one one day but all
they have is that some slots
right now just to pick up eight
weeks at a time how does that
look.
I work eight weeks and then.
How do I get paid whatever
Lloyd's.
This Secretary nighters would
like to respond.
Mr chair representative incense
you would still have to matching
the bill is that it just
verifies one of the many
requirements to receive
unemployment benefits you still
have to work the required number
just takes a year and I am
friends they can use the minutes
not guessing that gets twenty
six and I'm tired short so you
still have to work that in for
hours if you had full time
employment somewhere else as I
did as you did when we have when
we acted as actions you may not
be eligible if you did certify
on a weekly basis the U. R. L.
people in available you would
not be eligible C. this doesn't
in my understanding really
expands the availability the
benefit except to clarify I
pieces the task.
Okay one one last thing.
Mr chair representative so with
the example I just gave you.
State I'm gonna hold on to like
get picked up and it takes me
fifteen years to get picked up

questions do I have to work to
be eligible for that benefit.
Both.
The.

eight weeks of the thirty two
weeks that application to.

that four eight week period
specific thirty two weeks but
then again you know you're
seeing that.
Hypothetical there are job
another job at.
I'm sorry to see what Mr I was
fired for years some of
procedure guide on how to use
hypotheticals for you to walk me

explain.

basically because of what I'm
getting from my
Because.
Is this comment and certainty of
that
the budget on what happens in
between now and then I'll study
some more this point is
respectfully ask support but if
things change we change my
decision thank you very much Mr.
This.
Do your closing of the
university already paid

legislative.
That much this.
Thank you thank you
Representative here on the floor
thank you for sharing.
Very good stuff.
You Representative Martínez.
The hot seat one eighty six.
What.
Right goals.
To
check out.
The technician.
These are great.
Thank you Sir.
Mexicans the agenda.
So it's up to you folks in the
state after the floor session
or.
Yes Representative.
I
make a state Mr chair members of
the committee on.
Appreciate your time.
This rigorous process.
This bill clarifies
staff.
Under current statutes if you
were if you.
Qualifies for the disabled
veteran property tax.
And you sell your home.
You cannot take your disabled
veterans benefit with you.
Your new house.
So that means it will provide
your old house.
Can take advantage of that this.
Well you pay property taxes on
the new.
All this bill does is allow that
disabled veterans to take that
into the new house.
Mr chair in front of you I
believe everybody has.
The amendment for special
problem.
Why the state voted for the
amendment this.
After talking to on the
assessors.
in Albuquerque is just
clarifying language of.
Of a very specific exemption.
So on page five lines three and
four.
You would strike for an
exemption.
On line six you'd strike that
tops.
In certain new there of this
current task.
And on line eight strike taxable
and insert in lieu thereof.
So as I.
Stay with the this.
Lower the risk of.
The house was well but it would
be one of the five eight three
or four strife with excessive
number two one nine six packs of
or to lose their a tax
University online expect that
suppose insert.
Mr chair I believe they did that
because of all deals with one.
The difference okay.
The new city but it was a
problem with the.
With the amendment I have a
motion with fifty minutes.
And then also come up.
The opposition up in the
emotion.
Of.
See this is.
Do you have enough to.
The bill.
Thank you Mr chairman members
with that I stand for questions
the audience uses of support was
provided.
The.
I see another hand which create
rate in opposition.
See none okay here in the
audience Sir.
Morning Mr good afternoon I just
just a morning meeting good
afternoon Mister chair.
I work with the assessors
billion I had earlier founding
the assessors minutes later
there and we do a survey on
these tax bills within all the.
And right now this is as it was
originally written we were at
fifty fifty supporting or
opposing so we're in the neutral
categories because of that they
did have an exemption so that
you know could be perceived as
the four thousand dollars well
with the new language I believe
we would be in support of that
of New you know as the bill is
currently amended the advantages
to this also it benefits from
the shows up after the deadline
June.
And would be able to apply to
the property for that tax year
payment because we have a
deadline is thirty days
following the mailing of the
notice of value the veterans so
that one day after that is a
hundred percent disabled.
They would have to wait till the
following years so they would on
taxes for the remainder of the
year no matter when they would
fill into that slot and that's
on the new fly on the transfer
there is some language in there
that allows a transfer very very
complicated we believe this but
also clarify that as well in
that it belongs to the current
tax years and not the tax year
is the year is presented so I I
think this is a good
legislation.
Officer for bringing forward as
it helps clarify what we're to
do with the budget for time and
the.
Mr chairman thank you for your
happening of that bills as we
discussed earlier this week

This bill is similar to a bill
that we introduced twenty
nineteen requesting the
department of workforce
solutions to study development
clean energy workforce Mexico
and to really essentially begin
the conversation of what
workforce development should
look like heading into the
future on this bill will begin
same conversation.
It could entail when it comes to
workers are currently be
excluded from receiving
unemployment insurance benefit
or something similar such as
wage replacement when they lose
their job at no fault of their
own other proposed research and
analysis will also look at the
potential providing weeks
differential for workers
transitioning out of extractive
industries we know at some point
oil and gas workers will have to
transition or there will also be
a potential that this is a very
old Thailand the streets will
also at that when it goes down
that economic assistance will be
available to them while they
retreat into a new job until
their job is is it comes back of
being able to find wage
differentials workers will be
training could be a powerful
Economic Forum for that worker
and their family but the local
economy and the local economies
as well but we have to study it
would cost to provide wage
differentials and how to
administer it so the study will
identify the categories and
included in the expanded state
based on employment program it
would identify program and
administrative costs of the WS
they would identify statutory
changes would also call on the
west work with impacted group
from excluded workers from the
state the business the policy
became community based
organizations we have talked to
folks in the WS I also will be I
will also let you all know that
this study well it hasn't
appropriation I requested that
my junior money pay for the
appropriation if it is not
appropriate so

pandemic that inclusion you why

Thank you Mr.

The state.
Just the ten times.
One day to the media.
Afternoon Mister chair and
members of the committee my name
is Lydia parking I I'm research
and policy analyst with New
Mexico voices for children
forces for Children stands in
strong support of hospital to
fifteen the state must explore
ways to find unemployment
unemployment benefits.
To exclude workers so they can
support themselves and their
families during a transition
period after job loss is also
the first thing to do to extend
unemployment benefits to
impacted workers from a system
that they're already paying
answered we ask for your support
of hospital to fifteen thank you
for your time.
The.
Thank you Mr chairman members of
the committee my name is fairly
big about a and I'm a workers
rights attorney for the New
Mexico Center on Law and Poverty
we think the sponsor for
introducing this important bill
we stand strong support of HB to
fifteen because it starts down
the right path and exclusions
from unemployment that hurt
workers in our economy
unemployment benefits provide
assurances that workers will be
able to feed their families if
they lose their job and services
and economic stabilizer when
recession hits providing
stimulus where it is needed most
the COVID nineteen pandemic
expose that thousands of workers
in New Mexico do not qualify for
unemployment assistance when
they lose their job to address
this unemployment was
temporarily expanded during the
pandemic to some categories of
workers who were not previously
eligible like those we're self
employed and some relief workers
with less earning history
several states created separate
programs provide similar
benefits to other excluded
workers in particular immigrants
studies have shown that these
federally funded benefits
provided vital support to these
workers their families and local
economies workers were currently
excluded from receiving
unemployment assistance pay
taxes and contribute to our
economy what what that is that
has been and always is essential
such as workers with health care
with our grocery stores keep
open during the COVID nineteen
pandemic several states have
taken steps to set up state
programs to fill the gaps left
by the federal unemployment
system for these reasons it is
critical for New Mexico to
understand the impact of these
solutions that prevent all
working New Mexicans from
receiving financial assistance
when they're unemployed by doing
this we take the right steps
toward ensuring that workers
their families in our community
are protected and supported when
you mess is unable to work for
these reasons we support this
bill and there's a committee to
pass it thank you.
We would.
The body of the body.
State
of.
Well that the sponsor hello
there is a lot of.
One of.
The leader of the militant.
The government.
You know
Mr chair representative the
statement that you'd be willing
to
And the some of your junior
funding.
To
match The appropriation.
but what if
what if this measure doesn't
make it through the Senate.
What the department still be
willing to implement seeing that
they have the money to do it
from or what have you kind of
on.
That that possibility.
Are any kind of
shared those spots with the
department in case the measures
on the S. and.
Madam chair representative thank
you for your question we have
been in communication with the
department workforce solutions
the of the appropriation that's
in that's in the bill is
obviously are something that I
would love for the legislature
to to.
On the use that as part of HB to
the chances of that happening
are are pretty slim at this
point
and so last week when the junior
funding deadline was was need to
be submitted the two hundred
thousand request was was
included in my in my junior
money
at as as part of a project that
I.
Am I about located major money
for this project.
Then the Mr chair
representative.
Uniformed question what have to
do with what if this measure of
this bill.
You know house bill two fifteen
does not make it.
Through the Senate does not pass
the Senate.
What the the department still be
willing to kind of.
Unfold the study is considering
that they have the funds to do
it madam chair Mr chair
representative from the
conversations that we've had
with DWS if the funding is
available
Whether it's through this
legislation or the junior money.
I mean they will they will do
that and we've been in
conversations with good that's
good to know Mr chair because
this is several significant kind
of
Effort to address some really
profound issues with our
workforce especially our
immigrant work force
your question I had
Is have other states been able
to.
Mr chair secure.
Budget four of the document the
Mr chair representative all at
the end of speak more explicitly
on that but as far as what yes
as far as I understand other
states are actually leading in
in this area.
Mr chair members of the
committee Representative Rubio
is exactly correct as I
mentioned in the intro Colorado
has already established a U. I.
type program specifically for
its immigrant workers who can
submit some documentation and
show that they lost their job at
no fault of their own similar to
you why and there is a state
fund that provides those
benefits and other states are
looking at something similar
looting course California
Washington state and New York.
Well that's good to know that Mr
chair that there is.
Kind of a presence.
in terms of are on full the
of unemployment benefits to all
the undocumented.
you know another you know when
you're presenting this Mr chair.
And representative
What was flashing through my
mind.
Was this initiative that
Former representative of funding
to fund.
I think you replace them Senate
Bill School says.
And myself we carry for the
longest time.
The measure.
That would
Qualified
Farm and ranch labors for a
workman's comp.
And actually when he are retired
to Josh.
I think the fund the bond ran
with it and actually we we would
get nowhere with that initiative
so and
But thanks to the efforts of a
combined effort that involves
almost.
there was a the lawsuit.
Filed
in a length of the for the.
The courts that ruled that
exemption.
Of the ranch and farm laborers
that that they would be exempt
from workman's comp insurance it
ruled that as unconstitutional.
So Mister chair even though the
law in the books still has an
exemption.
Basically it's unconstitutional
so.
The farm and ranch operators you
know if there is an injury that
qualifies in the criteria
workman's comp have to kind of
address that compensation issue
with the that with the the
injured worker.
So my questions.
Under workman's comp.
Statute.
And with the with the court
decision regarding the
constitutionality.
Of exam team ranch and farm
labors to undocumented workers.
All I workman's comp.
Mr chair representative I am not
internet sadly but I will hand
it over to governor.
Thank you Mr chairman members of
the committee Representative
Garcia so following that ruling
you're exactly correct that it
was ruled unconstitutional to
exclude
those workers immigrant workers
from workers comp now they do
have.
Access to workers comp my
question was specifically was.
Based on the on the structure of
the Courts Mr chair striking
down the constitutionality of
that exemption this app also
allows the document.
To qualify for workers comp
benefits.
Mr chair members of the
committee yes so Mister chair.
Via.
So we have a program in place.
That addresses.
You know in this case injury.
To.
Any worker Mr chair including
the undocumented.
That
I think these credence Mr chair
to.
Initiative that
House Bill to fifteen wins
thanks for.
So we have a foundation on which
to kind of a catapult.
into the study I think we kind
of also be fine the real
intricacies of what that would
entail in terms of of the
undocumented qualify for.
Fund
so on thank you Mr chairman
thank you Representative
Representative.
The most competitive market I
just I just have a couple
questions Mr chair
Chair representative.
I'm sure is there any other.
Group that would be considered
ineligible other than the.
Thank you Mr chair
representative yes and I can
have that be allowed to go over
and specifically I know that
right now one of the the the
community that we've been
working with particularly on a
separate piece of legislation
our oil and gas workers in the
southeastern part of the state
specifically who lost their jobs
during the pandemic in March of
twenty twenty when the oil and
gas numbers went down many of
them did not qualify for
unemployment insurance.
Mr chair members of the
committee representative
Martinez it's yes the study will
also examine other types of
workers who are currently
excluded and I believe we heard
from some of them in the
audience that includes
individuals who are self
employed or independent
contractors but perhaps work in
the home or is there home based
health aids and their technical.
The contractors and excluded at
the moment from receiving you it
is.
Thank you for that very clear
answer it
It helps my second question Mr
chair representative.
Is similar to what
Representative Garcia yes if
this does not pass all the way
through.
Your appropriation.
In the junior bill to workforce
solutions as that agreement
already been worked out.
That Mr chair representative yes
I mean we've been in talks with
the WS throughout this entire
process we did not proceed or we
can forward with this
legislation and delegate
specifically putting the two
hundred thousand dollars
engineer money without talking
with them so they are in the
loop of what's happening.
Mr chair representative.
His.
The decision I'm working class
from houses to fifty.
Hello from.
Eurofins Representative shook up
thank you.
We want to make sure.
I just talk normal problems.
I just
Mr chair representative I'm
gonna tell you
I worry a little bit of military
first law worry about how on
this would increase
worker participation.
gives the deposits but I really
appreciate what
Representative Garcia brought up
which is important I thought it
was very important to to include
some of the same I I think we
have a.
Turmoil in and throughout the
state and and
Some businesses.
Or industries that are
struggling with.
All this all these compression
issues and reduces our person
possibly offs and other things
we will make sure things are
called incentives.
And and you know
I I really respect you Mr chair
representative I'm gonna be
honest with you that you want to
put your money to this this
shows your lawyer you're willing
to to do that that means a lot
hello I have some apprehensions
over the whole thing
not because against people more
for added security but.
Because I think we just have so
many issues that are causing.
It's like
This is the ingredients are you
do put together between
employers.
Employment issues if there's
there there's these binding
problems whether it's raising
raising up.
The minimum wage or all these
extra
Requirements that are
inadvertently thank you for.
your worker participation as
because a reducing hours
and for cutting job for not
replacing jobs and so it isn't
it is a problem
I I think they're all kind of
hold in in some ways have
responsibilities with one
another I think it's good to see
what you can do it I also
I just I just was one question
was this is a specifically for
just a pandemic situation or is
is important there are thank you
Mr Chairman representative no
also this is for here on out I
think what has been said in some
of the COVID is in the public
comment is that when the
pandemic first started there was
we saw a lot of gaps in terms of
he was getting a budget was not
getting benefits and and it was
it's just a system that needs to
be reviewed and looked at this
this is ability study will will
do that it'll it'll not
hopefully it'll not only
identify all the things that I
laid out but that it might even.
Discover other things I think
that we we as I mentioned before
twenty nineteen we were able to
work with the department
workforce solutions to do a
study with the university New
Mexico to look at what the clean
energy economy could look like
here in the state of New Mexico
we feel that that was a very
successful study that helped us
to really look towards
establishing sort of is a stable
economy task force that we
worked on and and a lot of the
bills that I've introduced this
last this next this year round
economic diversification
this bill this specific
feasibility study I think can
really inform the rest of us
when it's completed that once
once we have a job to do but
also that our agencies like the
WS they need the supports that
that they think they.
Funding a lot of that's what we
need to understand that a lot of
our departments the funding but
they're also they the funding
needs also
illustrate that and and I can
address the needs of our
community and so we hope that
this feasibility study will will
help us address that.
Hi Mr chair representative right
I hope that you know and I know
the study on the broad scope of
the testing as of be honest with
you but I hope it shows how.
Of the.
All of the ingredients of what
what are happening causing some
of the layoffs and reduction in
hours I reached out to one of my
first one of the reporters for a
small business support in my
district and asked a lot of what
are your numbers he says I
reduced by force but twenty.
From two hundred fifty workers
to one ninety eight.
And and the cost of my business
was five hundred fifty thousand
dollars which meant in
additional fees for him and then
you have to share that with.
Well focus client reviews
clients what what purchasing
from and registration hours and
taking a hit on on his of his
body also everybody hurts in the
whole situation so I I I I I
think it's great that you're
willing to stand up here try to
find a way to fix this and I I
just hope that you're you're
you're study expands to other
causes that are doing this we
can find a balance of all that
and I will concern is I is is
still why we still have such a
non participating worse
workforce now.
stuff everywhere and I tell my
kids Mr chair representative
said anyone who works today
anyone who lives works and
shells and the bright light in
any employment this is going to
skyrocket along with kids that
it would opportunity now that
you'll be you'll never see you
may not see for a long time
because employers are looking
for people that are hard workers
honest respectful and want to
know what the work hard and so I
I I I think this is the right
time for people to get back into
the workforce I hope to see that
thank you Mr.
And the workers good employers
teacher I agree.
Okay I have a proper motion and
I have sent to do.
Second.
Representative market is that
the opposition to that love.
Show all members present voting
in the.
Thank you.
Yes.
Now we.
Yeah.
Because we.
Time.
Thank you.
Thank you Valentine's day.
Is.
Missing.
Representative LA use.
Did you.
This
call.
That the governor's outside.
Martinez.
Just to make sure.
The less than yes here the.
Is
that correct.
But
we're really.
Program for the.
Additional public judge.
S. C. is years we are ready.
Okay Mister chair members of
the.
We are all on house bill two
forty five this is actually the
substitute it should all be
your.
Folks.
It would be is
number.
I'm sorry to.
Eight two two five.
Two four three five one.
Really go thank thank you.
All right Mr members.
Right this is a little move this
up for.
The second that.
You know opposition to that if
you receive thank you Mr chair
this is a pretty straightforward
bill the bill prohibits
compulsory attendance of
employees in both the public and
private sector
and what that means is that
employees have the options of
attending or not attending of
meetings called by the employer
that are in a political region
they just or you related matter
it is important to know that
this bill is modeled after the
Oregon law which is been in
place for thirteen years and a
Connecticut law was enacted last
year and I do want to point out
that both of those bills have
sued
the constitutional or survived
constitutional challenges
to each of those bills the
language in those bills.
I do have an expert witness with
me.
Again.
Good afternoon chair out from
members of the committee my
machine use that as an attorney
here in New Mexico have practice
plan in labor law the bill is
exact street for right now under
the law an employer can force
its employees to sit down and
listen to whatever political
speech the employer wants those
employees to listen to what this
bill does is for tax invoice to
say I don't want to listen to
governor Lujan Grisham speak at
our business state or I don't
want to listen to Donald Trump
speaker business today without
fear of retaliation it simply
prohibits the ability of
employers to force it to their
employees as a captive audience
to listen to whatever the
employer wants those employees
to listen to so it just to be
clear it has nothing to do with
what we for affecting the first
amendment an employer may
continue to say whatever it
wants it protects only those
employees who do not voluntarily
wish to listen to political
speech in which.
And Mr chair also have the
Representative Janelle.
Thank you.
And in your.
Okay.
The guy that.
So the question this is the
we all use the bodies for this
legislation.
Okay everybody in the
opposition.
One okay resulted in opposition
go ahead.
Thank you Mr chair members of
the by race some of them general
counsel for the New Mexico
counties I have nothing to build
but based on the constitution I
think of our locations continue
the.
Reflective of
Mexico already have.
Amendment protections and
protection the first amendment.
Protection that applies to
public.
And put in an actually sue if
they feel like they've been
violated under section nineteen
eighty three at the federal.
In addition it appears in Mexico
Civil Rights Act was passed is
house bill four.
A couple.
And that is working for you
protections others.
For again protected speech and
then.
That.
For.
Also.
Protections for
in addition that the thank.
I.
State and local government
employees whose salaries are
paid in part federal funds.
What what it says is that they
can use their official authority
or other influence to is here
with our fact.
Election workers or.
We
contribute to art.
And so there are there are
protections like I said state
law protections protections of
the private public.
This law it may be
straightforward but it's very.
It.
It's email it is communication.
One.
Definition of of public matters
is
matters relating to this parties
rules regulations change that
changes the whole year right now
we're in the legislative session
I myself this came from a
meeting with a lot of county
employees asking them you know
how with this proposed bill not
this particular one one that
would affect jails how would
that affect you hello you know
what can be so the source of
political communication also
take actions happen every day
and the in the house use work.
In retaliation is already
something that our public
employees are protected from and
so what this would do though is
find you know sweeping
protections for any sort of
discipline which is defined to
include things like changing
your schedule you don't like the
schedule that you've been given
your hours reviews and I think
the real
Problems and I'll also point out
by for politico for punitive
damages which no governmental
entity has insurance for you
know so important details.
Policy what is that this would
something that would have.
between public employees.
and it would.
What in seventy years over
seventy years.
Of.
Zacks presses that into a very
recently was very.
Years.
Funds to
There for that and.
Four eight to hear what their
respective.
Back to.
We propose.
Early on this screen it wants to
speak in opposition.
Those who have their okay of
those support affect right here
on this side and work my way
that way thank you Mr.
Chairman members the committee
jobless youth with the New
Mexico federation of labor just
the last year I I don't think we
see the committee substitute but
it sounds like it's something.
And not into the port of this
bill attorney's office
testifying on until all I you
know this is Sir the the view
this as a a worker protection
bill for all workers not just
public employees but all workers
who could be forced to attend
meetings that would threaten
their right to collectively
bargain regular right to
actually form you
really take away rights and this
is just something that is
unacceptable in any form even if
there are protections clearly
this bill is necessary to highly
give protections and and really
codified so for all the reasons
that I'm sure you'll be hearing
me very much thank both of the
Sanchez for bringing this bill
off and you're you're thank you.
Thank you Mr chairman members of
the committee job searches
American federation of teachers
and all we are the
representative public employees
I there are many privately I
institutions that if you
representative cross the country
I think go more importantly the
of this bill has been all over
the news is following any of the
first organized organized
Starbucks organized now just
this morning yes.
Organization are we see the
lakes that forced to throw to
work
Buyers use our some of the
things that that we grew from
previous tests on it's well
documented these are tactics
being used to intimidate us
specially young workers you know
workers workers of color and get
through the partially use
protecting the workers
themselves when they take that
courageous opportunity you the
workplace and we do urged
committee support today thank.
Good.
As soon economics of US
officials.
This is the beginning of
creating a level playing field
in terms of understanding the
history of sociology discussion
of which I understand expertise
involved also being in is caps
working in the cotton fields
Texas working construction work
in a variety of areas in terms
of seeing this especially in
Texas thank you from the our
folks and being coerced and
intimidated the various ways for
very long I I've seen it happen
here in the of eight U. N. M. as
in other places.
Thank you.
Go ahead.
Good afternoon Mister chairman
members of the committee writing
interest I Representative had
twenty five hundred graduate
student employees that
University of New Mexico New
Mexico State University standing
up in support of this bill
really want to thank the
sponsors of the sponsors for
bringing it and this is a really
important staff not just in in
protected workers rights rating
protecting that fundamental
right to collective bargaining
in guarding against what we see
from the players national as the
previous speaker mentioned the
kinds of you busting that we've
see in terms employers across
the country providing employees
faced with that you must in the
right to not have to listen to
it right this is not about
whether their employer conceived
by doctors.
Them but they don't have to
subject themselves to listen to
it without fear television.
There's a lot all the time we
know that right there's a much
higher percentage of support for
you in this country than there
are workers are actually you
guys because the process is
incredibly difficult and at
every turn people are faced with
you know risking the the job
that they have mounted you know
to improve the the working
working instead of taking a
small step to guard against a
worker you know doesn't want to
this into a political speech and
high end coming from their
employer whether you support
unions are opposing it seems
like a really fundamental piece
of living in a free society to
be able to say I don't have to
listen to my employer speak
political speech at school I
want to thank everybody for
considering the spelling thing
encouraging I will support.
But Mr chair members of the
committee Josh and asked me
thank you for yes no support
thank all of our sponsors for
history in order to support.
Yes that is.
Mr chairman of the committee the
straps I twenty five here to
stir UPS drivers and just I want
to let you know that we thanks
for your support this because
we've had
Google is just where the hell
captain said we just would like
to have the freedom to choose to
attend these meetings without
disciplinary action so thank you
sponsors and thank you all.
You.
St Onge street.
Okay back to the US secretary to
the sponsor.
Those questions.
Who is the market is.
Mr Chairman representative.
I think you know first in the
read through all of this bill
about.
This makes sense.
I thought it was simply.
Wanting to protect.
Not having to sit through of.
Government iterations of New on
rations speech or.
So we're talking about Trump or
whatever and I thought that
makes sense to me.
I will be able to make that
choice well then mile mission to
your.
Witnesses in the problem it
seems to me now that this is
more of a veiled.
Protection of.
And people were trying to build
the unions.
Mr chair Representative is that
a fair interpretation point what
this is.
Mr secretary and Mr of chair
will be for two years Jericho
Representative Martinez faire
the state it accomplishes both
goals.
Mr chair representative isn't.
Are these protections already
covered in the Civil Rights Act.
Mr chair representative Martinez
no.
Under the current Civil Rights
Act an employer can force its
employees to listen to eight
hours each day for eight hours
of explanation as to why they
should inform you there are no
protections in the law currently
which is why the bill is for us.
Thank you Mr chair
representative all of which.
The thank you Mr chair.
So
How does the bill address
employment scenarios involving
organizations that engage in
political activities as part of
their core mission.
Chairman representative there
are sixty sections and if you'll
look and.
Section D..
Section three rather there's six
except for and we can go over
those sick exceptions but the
one in particular today that
would provide instances that
employers emitted from
communicating information
earmarked by the water
communicate the second exception
is that they are not prohibited
from communicating information
that is necessary for such
employees to perform their job
duties so in this example you
provided those are that that
information is necessary to
perform the job in the Senate it
would be prohibited from
communicating that information I
would also point out that fifty
exemption which is casual
conversations are not
prohibited.
The sixties action also I think
is germane to your question.
Managers and supervisors under
this proposed legislation would
still be subject to a captive
audience speeches from their
lawyers so if the owner of a
company wanted to talk to these
managers deserve our managers or
supervisors about the subjects
those conversations with
protective case for tax regular
workers and the workers who are
not supervisors or who are not
managers and don't don't have
the ability to say no no this
is.
Thank you Mr chair
representative.
What is the definite I'm looking
at the definition of political
matters it's on the bill it's on
page two.
And it's lines four through
nine.
Just go back on my his job was
to support.
And.
The thing that come up was
legislative proposals.
And I'm just thinking back to
all of my employees in that.
So that would be no.
Chair representative budget I
would disagree the employees
could choose if they wanted to
be involved but you could
terminate them if they didn't
want to be called.
Do they have to be in the
meeting or not they do not have
to be the.
Thank you Mr chair
representative.
Thank you Mr chair
representative.
Rating this initiative or
You clarify.
Committee with the difference
between the original the on the
southwest.
I am able to F..
Is that I chaired the only
change are you added on for that
I don't for.
Elaborate as to why that once.
Jerebko Representative Garcia
there were concerns that
religious organizations good
because of the situation they
didn't want to be caught up with
and so there we need to the bill
a religious section so that
religious organizations
religious corporations entities
associations educational
institutions are not subject to
this law they are exempt from
all.
To avoid any first amendment
concerns of these.
and the other question I had.
Is on the current page three
nine eleven.
Maybe this is a matter for the
judiciary but.
Usually
We're talking about because of
the action.
the
We.
All of party is entitled to.
Once or twice.
The amount.
And that you have on here
Be awarded reasonable attorney
fees.
I never seen that worded that
way not when there's a the
nation having to deal with
because of the action.
The reasonable attorney fees
into the spelled out that it's
it's it's it's it's twice
of the matter or.
For quite compensation or crisis
compensation why why the
reasonable there's a severe is
elect short reasonable terra at
Representative Garcia is the
practice in the state of New
Mexico to provide generally
speaking that each party payers
of their own attorney costs but
however in the context of labor
law for example New Mexico's
minimum wage violations of
minimum wage act provisions of
the whistleblower protection act
those sorts of claims brought by
employees we have provided
provisions in the law in the
state of New Mexico to allow
those employees who are Dan who
prevailed two other attorneys
fees paid as well ease universal
not just in New Mexico fact that
for example the fair labor
standards act or civil rights
claims under federal law
provides for attorney's fees for
the employees because they don't
typically have the means to
bring an action and those
provisions that many claims
though.
One it the just continue to
happen is this give the worker
an opportunity to bring those
claims and have more of a level
playing field.
But it's it's standard here in
New Mexico.
Sure that in recent that
sentence and I can see why.
You're looking at the
reasonable in terms of line of
attorney fees.
Not so much.
The the the damage espectadores
for drugs so I I understand
that's all I have Mister chair.
If you read.
Thank you Mr chair
Representative you might okay so
I guess I'm looking at this from
the darkness of by the
government to right so and
maintenance falls under sections
three hundred twenty general and
my goal and mission is to
already a is to prosecute
criminals and I'll hold
criminals accountable health
crime victims and in those
offices you are constantly
talking to your employees not
just supervisors about
legislation that point the
office you send over your
turkeys to testify it's that's
not a request thank you you know
once you go yes for this
legislation
we talk about civic
organizations that might the
like involved in this and I was
that we you know like our place
to be involved in all this to
your benefit the office now with
that fall under exception two.
Or not.
Because of that and I had this
very specific organizations that
have.
But missions I guess you could
say.
Chair up on Representative
rebate the answer your question
is yes it would fall under those
exceptions in some respects but
some elements of your example of
probably would for example you
do in the future you would be
able to force employees to go
testify it if they didn't feel
comfortable testifying on a
political matter you could force
them to do it any could
terminate them for refusing to
testify heads okay Mister chair
Representative an expert so it
it would change in the sense
that I couldn't save her want
you you need to go over yes I
this bill and you know support
our offices position on it
because I'm the Attorney General
this is my position on this bill
on behalf of the office you just
could and usually Senator
attorneys to go do that as you
probably know so that would not
be allowed in the city chose our
work.
Check on Representative believe
that they would have to redo it
they could be forced under the
penalty of termination to do
that even if it's in line with
the office's mission and what
their job and what they're hired
to do.
Support let's say private
legislation or whatever it might
be chair of phone Representative
review yes you could terminate
employees if they didn't want to
support the legislation Mr
Chairman but what I get sued.
As if you terminate if I turn to
read into that what if I need to
go over to talk on that bill.
Chairman representative reef
date the employee would have the
choice that the employer could
refuse under the law they can't
refuse now under the bill as
proposed they could say I I
decline.
And if you let them decline
that's the end of the matter if
you said well because of your
declination I'm going to
terminate you then they would
have cost act.
Under this bill because no other
state attorneys are at will need
DA or AG can fire any attorney
for any reason that would change
that this bill let's say in that
scenario share our own
Representative read the
employees who are government
employees are employees of will
Act they they have a property
right in their continued
employment there are some for
example the public defender's
office who are you and so they
have additional rights above and
beyond those employees will
rights but the answer questions
yes you can.
You would be able to terminate
that for not wanting to testify
all right and Mr chair
experiment a and I expansion
we're saying but like these
attorneys are at will and she
made a call to action if you're
caressing them someone.
As a DA I could I could let go
of the internet for any reason I
want to pretty much under the
law because they are at will so
it just seems to be this bill
would change that for situations
like that but I appreciate your
answers and I just wanted to
clarify if it applies that
situation so Mr chair.
Representative.
Mr chair representative
I find it is conflicting to see
that you can hire someone.
You pay them to represent your
company or whatever.
And if they don't like what
you're come in the direction
companies going in they can
refuse and tell you know and so
we and the.
It just.
That's.
We on the line for the first
chair representative.
I think there are three
companies.
that sometimes there are
political stances that do affect
companies across the board.
And the way I'm reading this is
if something was affecting our
all my miners the cessation in
my area modest.
Estimate this legislation can
affect my miners and my job was
to inform my the sales from a
working there and exceed what I
needed to know how this truly
affects not just our company but
could affect your jobs.
In this time my hands because of
political stance.
That's that's over the line for
me.
I just I don't understand this
what what do you consider.
To me having freedom of speech.
Is here.
There's no definition for
political matters what happens
when a group text Mr chair
representative somebody says
something on on a group text and
and they're not happy with it
little wonder if.
You know it this can lead us
into the litigation issues this
opens the door for a lot of to a
lot of those things can you
define exactly what.
Political matters we.
Chairman representative Cadena
is yes on page two that section
to see political matters means
matters relating to elections
for political office political
parties legislative proposals
rule or regulation proposals in
the decision to point or support
a political party or political
organizations civic
organization organization
fraternal organization or labor
organization and just to be
clear there is no cause of
action to the employer
terminates the employee for
refusing to listen to the speech
okay very well Mr chair
representative so you say you
know so how many to call of a
person to meeting.
And this is going to affect the
the our company.
My ability for a person's
ability to hire and keep someone
hired that's going to alter the
affect my ability to pay our
bills to make that happen and I
can express it as this may be
one employee refuses Mr chair
I'm not initial expenses you
know what.
Really do show up after the
initial.
Then bill says you don't want
those guys issue of journalism
under sure.
Pretty soon you can have a
meeting to discuss those things
because they don't have to
thousands on fire than than.
Everything is fine.
Just realize they need to get
your point across you want to be
able to express to show here
that you restricting the of the
the freedom of speech of a
person four and that is
invested.
Thousands millions maybe they
have all of maybe they're
they're lean because of that
they've got off of mortgage on
that business.
And this legislation could
affect not just the not just
that but they're million points
people and so as long as they're
tolerate you're not showing up
to medium you want to listen to
that if it it basically I'm not
going to be litigated against
laws are partial you know the it
just has a the hands of the of
the employer.
His ability to communicate with
their staff.
And even the good in different
ways in terms.
You're giving the you're giving
basically you're given all the
rights off balance.
To the employees just to refuse
to do whatever notes whatever
some things that you're asking
them to do it's so broad it's so
for a.
That I can see this going to
court.
Four four and then your and they
have been to this possible for.
Everybody.
And so this is serious I mean
this is I mean just three pages
but it's it's pretty invasive in
the in the Mr chair
representative in in the ability
to for us employer to stand up
and and expressed.
Anything it I mean if you've
been it seems political.
I mean that is so broad.
Even if you're trying to define
it was Mr chair representative
it is extremely broad and I see
this causing a lot of provided a
lot of a lot of litigation
against companies it's gonna
kill productivity issue if they
if because.
What is political to one person
Mr chair is in the sort of
political to another person that
may be a moral stance that I
have it is just political
Stafford for another person
maybe it's just
my mic fund I don't care about
politics we're gonna care about
religion but I'm trying to run
my business but the other party
sees it as political.
And that.
Because a lot of problems and
and and that's that's just
read here I can't support this I
think we already have
protections I think it's
important that is is is a bad
actor is firing their
individuals Mr chair
representative and just firing
that left to right because they
don't listen if you run a better
company in a couple years.
Mr chair if you're trying to
execute you're trying to protect
your employees you're trying to
show them love working here.
I prosper you prosper we all
prosper together there are
things we have to discuss to
make that happen.
And I think this is breaking
down the ability to communicate
and.
Non definitional political
matters and all the one person's
feeling of what is political
what another person may not
receive that as political could
cause litigation self and it's
just going to cause division
it's going to cost
Problems of between the floor
and employees and eventually and
employers so you know I can't do
this anymore.
Trying to run a company here
you're not showing up to
meetings I can't express now all
these of the all these other
employers or employees are
following suit I can't run my
company more and if I leave you
offering
if I lay you off controllers
fight you anything you can.
Mr chair representative to file
a lawsuit.
I guess you because I like the
color suit today
it doesn't mean as no bearing
but you could Mr chair

think and so I can support this

the ability for communication

In the woods Garratt.
So.
The the the go ahead thank you
Mr chair thank you committee so
for folks that are getting the
pages all pages one through
three definitions that are new.
And then page four line nine and
ten is the language in that
section.
And then on page and everything
else is already in statute
nothing else to ship the only
thing the ships is on page six
the very end line twenty three
flights to New Mexico statutes
not just percent of this of this
act.
To summarize the reason why is
is that we were able to sit down
with the office of the
superintendent to make sure that
what we're trying to do was
affected.
And so in this first sure John
what it does is it loosens
Employee leasing contractors to
be a hundred these the insurance
at and it also goes through and
leader defines how the employer
employees are included when
they're looking at health
insurance and so for context as
you there was a new agency.
Analysis that essentially said
from the agency's perspective
nothing just for the office of
the superintendent is still
looking at the same but for all
of the season and heroes what
they what how it works clarifies
who is included as an employee
and that they're able to
aggregate and go over health
insurance plans there for larger
companies it allows you to
choose to go for smaller one.
just you know we Elsie's or HR
professional companies that
lease out professionals to
smaller companies that may not
have the thank you note for each
part department and all the
Emily.
The to the the U. specialty
would bring this up.
For those of us have a motion
detector set.
Motion.
We have a problem Representative
substituted any opposition to
that motion is not an issue
thank you thank you Sir.
So that just to be clear this
includes EMTs as part of the
insurance act so that it would
be underneath the office of the
superintendent and then what it
also does it clarifies that
employee leasing contractors
that essentially so each are
providers professionals to
smaller companies that may not
be large enough to those tax
professionals on their own of
they can be included in the act
to get larger healthcare
insurance packages that may be
more important to have the same
provisions but just for a larger
all would be I do have family
Marshall was the government
affairs director for the
national association of
professional employer
organizations yield on if it's
okay by the committee she can
skip a couple words.
Thank you Mr chair for the
committee after comments so
professional clear organizations
or P. as provide needed
meaningful HR solutions to small
and mid size businesses in New
Mexico and across the country
they do that by entering into a
permanent relationship with this
businesses can be certain
employer obligations for half.
Raul Senate's tax administration
regulatory compliance assistance
just some of the many
Services appears find in there
actually refer to as in policing
contractors in New Mexico and
are subject to licensing and
regulation by the New Mexico
regulation licensing department
in in statute so existing law in
New Mexico early already
provides PO's are required to
provide even any benefits
required by law thank you for
your support he's on the New
Mexico legislature is currently
expenses explicitly recognize
pias FY years including for
purposes of providing health
benefits as employer including
in accordance with laws and
practices New Mexico maybe he is
our player sponsor fully insured
large to health plans that
provide comprehensive coverage
to the worksite employees these
fully insured health insurance
policies are regulated by the
New Mexico also superintendent
of insurance and fully compliant
Federal formals Care Act
important.
Offered their worksite employees
covered under such plans they
are not selling insurance rather
as employer sponsored the plan
appears find worksite employees
access to health solutions
please yes so so the purpose of
this bill is to codify into New
Mexico office peers can lawfully
provide police are sure large
group health plans to small
businesses they partner with and
individuals who work for this
office is just and this is
consistent with health plans
such plans operate
conflating contractors are
currently part licensing
regulated New Mexico through the
state employee leasing Act when
the bill was originally drafted
it was a two it was it was
intended to independently
releasing Act where I federally
insured health plan offered by
police contractor that was made
available to the contractors
clients would be treated no
differently than fully insured
sponsored by other employees in
Mexico so the office of
superintendent of insurance
indicated they fatally the
present more preparation and the
Mexico insurance can answer that
clarified that the rules apply
and these stances and so we had
numerous meetings with LSI
discussed their concerns and so
we are able to agree on
alternative language and that is
desired legislative solution I
need strict code instead so at
what I did want to say that I
really appreciate the
opportunity to work with Ellis I
am more collaboration said
under this bill all the
employees that in previous
contractor told police to be
advocated for purposes of
determining rather than for
these properties policy but we
subject response engine from
Mexico.
So largely role generally ties
if there's have a player has
over fifty employees and this
again is consistent with how
employees contractors and
operated New Mexico for many
years I'm and so the the group
health policies issued to
completely some contractors
subject to large people rules
all the workers in there dad
plainly seen aeration will have
the opportunity to participate
under that policy and and so
operate this way that for issues
without any issues I'm so sorry
eighty two fifty five it just
clarifies employee leasing
companies licensed in the state
of New Mexico can continue to
sponsor and offer fully insured
large group of and so the
worksite employees which will
bring Mexico in line with the
vast majority of states to
recognize changes in sponsored
health benefit plans for the
worksite employees thank you
Mister chair and committee for
the Action Comics.
For questions who will the
on his new buddy here in support
of the state.
The money in opposition.
We have somebody in support of
the screen okay under the young
man here thank you Mr chairman
Scott Scanlon registered
lobbyists for radio
and I to want to echo
acting superintendent
contentious
and her staff really worked hard
with us to perfect this bill and
and Mr chairman as you noted
point three so and so we did go
back and forth and the we've
we've done it is a good job
well as I wanted this portion of
the lawn to the insurance code
the aggregations field and
clarifying the large and small
groups all of the health plans
are compliant with state and
federal laws we've been doing it
for over twenty years and so
really this bill is about status
quo
clarifying is working with the
the size of the richer support
thank you Mr chair.
Good.
Multiple.
Right right.
Good.
Thank you yeah my name is
Malcolm Slee I'm outside counsel
in a PO so I work with miss
marsh and I appreciate the
opportunity to speak in support
of this bill
this echo miss Martian Mr
Scanlon's comments I I won't
speak for a what the period of
time but we greatly appreciate
size cooperation as they they
helped us hammer out the
legislative language which we
think accomplishes exactly what
needs to be accomplished and is
that Mr stamina said you know
this is really about just
preserving the rights of PO
simply some companies to given
what they've done in New Mexico
for many years which is offer
fully insured large for welfare
benefit plans to worksite
employees which is a tremendous
alternative for small businesses
as they try to navigate the
group health insurance market so
we would appreciate your support
for this bill thank you.
Is that for.
The lead to.
Thank you Mr Chairman said the
questions okay members of the
committee.
I
want to thank the sponsor the
experts for going back and back
and back we came into the office
of superintendent of insurance
to get the language right to get
it in the right section code to
accomplish that goal because you

our small and medium size
businesses in.
