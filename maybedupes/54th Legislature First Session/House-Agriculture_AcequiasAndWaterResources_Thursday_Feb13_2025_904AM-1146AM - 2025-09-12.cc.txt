from the project funded by
the state. So that's that's the
next year.
OK and uh and Marta
and then on the
On, on, on, on page 7, section
B.
Uh,
or B section section 3,
the adopt.
Uh
For
The money that goes out.
So those rules are already in
place, right?
Um, um,
Madam yes
that went from regulation to
nothing to do with
what we were requesting any
amount that's the program
and then uh.
On page
Page 9.
Uh,
we talked about this we talk
about disadvantaged community.
Uh
And, and, and, and, and, and I
believe this community means
having problems.
In, in, in, in, uh, also in that
definition.
primarily that definition
deals with the levels
in the community,
um, so it doesn't pollution
process used by the
priority list
and then they rank them by um uh
the need, the, the needs of the
community, particularly
the Act.
in
disadvantages.
So
let me make sure I
included in the rules is that
that.
um pollution is not considered
to prioritize vantaged
communities is is a definition
that deals with the way in which
um pollution is not considered
to prioritize vantaged
communities is is a definition
that deals with the
on the list to access that
funding.
OK, so.
Let let let's talk a little
about this Marta.
So, so you're aware
of the situation we
we discussed it before.
And
When I look this up on the
internet.
on the definition of.
Of a
Disadvantaged communities.
Or this community
uh sorry my
chair if he needs one. I think
I
um, uh, federal laws and there
is some environmental justice.
Um, I would say relative to the
project.
Um, there are, there are
separate grants solely for
emerging concerns such as um and
so, um,
it.
Hello.
I
don't really about community as
much as it does with
what
kind of project.
OK, so, so let's let's simplify
what I'm asking is there a PP
money and then this program
and there's
no, no.
coming down.
with all the funding that we
provide
That's what this does.
There are
emerging contamins
that grants that
that when we come down we can
instead of
um instead of loans forgiveness.
program.
actually
have a principle component, OK,
and the reason I'm I'm touching
on that.
is because
and we're gonna see it other
and we're gonna see it other
places we've seen
before and my concerns are.
That that these
dealing
with this pollution needs help
from the state.
And, and as you know, I've been
working.
To help, uh.
Some of my constituency.
And they need money to put in a
water. We need $2 million
for project would do
do is it would cover.
The area that
In and close
to the.
Uh,
that has been drawn out like
different.
They're people.
and
and then
then they outs have been in
and we don't what has happened
since then.
was announced.
That that we had a problem is
the people.
Uh, the wellbeing of the people
of our concern
not only mentally but but uh.
Uh, physically.
And then
There's probably 200 homes.
200.
Uh
Home Plus uh uh acreage that has
been bought by people and want
to be developed.
And
Those those plans there those
homes they value has decreased.
I mean, would you go to.
Intimidated by
or they have to.
To supply them,
home so so those homes, the
value has gone down.
Dramatically.
And then
The county.
The those people are gonna wind
up going to the county saying we
don't want to be taxed on on
what our home used to be worth
now is not worth anything and
that that's going on with the
dairy that they shut down.
The nobody wants it, nobody
bought it, buy it, nobody would
touch it, so the so the county's
losing tax dollars.
So somehow.
We need to work with these
areas.
And get get get these storms
that we can put water to them.
So that somehow that put some
kind of relief.
On all three areas that I talked
about.
So
We have a lot of money in the
state of New Mexico.
And and everybody talks about
the governor talked about it in
her speech,
everybody talks about it in
Santa Fe.
But, but how we get our hands on
this
to put it on a
On a uh project that needs to be
done.
Is the real challenges.
It is
It is hard to do and and you can
walk your shoes off in these
halls and you can talk to
everybody and you don't know
where you're gonna wind up.
At the end of the day they're
nobody nobody makes any promises
they just everybody is working
on it and I believe with all
good intentions and.
But
So, so that's why I'm asking
these questions on this bill and
I'll proceed to wrap it up
pretty quick.
Uh
And and and and and it seems
like the rules.
Uh
They they sound pretty pretty
easy here in front qualify for
these, but then we go to page
10.
On online through.
5 to 7.
It seems to tighten it up a
little bit as to as to who.
Let me see
Who who could meet the
requirements for that that
really doesn't change that's
probably just language in the
bill that's talking about how.
And then, uh
Or are some of these.
Are, are, are, are not all these
30 year loans or 40-year loans.
That, uh, or 30 years loans
could be extended to be.
Grants
And then, and then in uh.
My question is what what had
happened.
If a community because I have
smaller communities in my area.
Uh
is always struggles, you know,
and, and what happens is one of
those communities doesn't pay
back and then and then I think
somewhere in the bill talks like
The, the, the department could
go and uh.
possess that
would even think about
representing a
water treatment plan or anything
like that.
um
let me just mention that uh the
place where the law what this
law does and amendments that
we're asking you to make, um,
primarily show up in
Um
Sections on 11.
Um, we blouse, uh, maximum term
of the loan of the finance
authority will take a look at
the communities what their books
and records and we'll see what
the useful life of the project
is
is in the best interest of the
community to go out 40 years
have a life.
so we don't want loans to be
longer
than uh than the useful life of
the project because 20 years in
need to take out another loan
that
that community system so
typically we have our loans
between 20 and 30 years, but
there may be those instances in
which they need to go a little
longer and we feel it's in the
best interest of the borrower
and the the program to extend
the term and that's what this
law allows
so I'll just mention that.
With our clients very closely if
they have any difficulty loans
will work to restructure that
loan.
So this is we're not in a
position of
communities uh the original term
loan at all. We will work with
them
to make certain that
circumstance
on a regular basis, um, so
that's that again to your
earlier point right now the
commute the the the program that
we're talking about is getting
special grant dollars from the.
This if we make changes it'll
allow the finance
principal forgiveness. So it
just simplifies the term that's
all we're asking you to do.
to allow us
to simplify and beneficial.
I think that concludes my
questions.
Thank you
Matthews.
Thank you Madam Chair.
Uh, representative and.
Um.
Um.
but
looking at the
Uh, information about these
loans
and uh farmers.
talks about.
Federal law requires that the,
Federal funding
Um, he provided eligible
recipients as loans with 100% in
principal forgiveness.
And then it goes on to say that.
With this amendment
uh will be able to offer.
Right
100 principle.
My understanding is correct.
uh but this.
you're reading from our FIR
we're or maybe you're now I'm
reading from the.
Agency analysis
of what we're talking about is
represented and I just talked
about which is at the funds
uh
currently we can't makes um
clients to small community
systems uh because of our state
law requirements, but the
federal law requires us to
extend those
grant-like so this is just
simplifies it by allowing us to
actually make those.
tell us whether there's a state
of the funding that needs to be
disadvantage of it to
be
disadvantage of its flexibility
to meet those.
Um
And uh.
Most of
that's correct.
Question.
Um
And
we would be hard pressed to
continue to use the program.
Madam, that's correct.
I'm wondering.
Uh, watching what's happening in
Washington.
Uh, if there has been any
indication.
be
Changes in the program.
Um,
and that the funding government
would no longer be available.
Now we're we're all concerned
about that, um, certainly more
programs are more heavily
impacted
this laws program through the
EPA has been in place
Now we're we're all concerned
about that, um, certainly more
programs are more heavily
impacted
this laws program through the
EPA has been in
many states
or red really rely on this is
usually the sole source of
funding to help
can get confusing
but there's a number of sources.
public infrastructure program as
well as other uh
so we highly doubt that they
would eliminate this funding
because in most states they
don't have any of those other
things they just have this one
program so we think they might
maybe off the edges down some of
the
edges that deal with the way in
which we think this is gonna
stay in place as it has been for
many, many years.
Uh, thank you very much.
Great thank you.
I'd like to make a motion for
mora.
Just a quick call.
OK.
Carrera.
Matthews.
P.
Rubio
Yes, I'm sorry, I'm late.
Ran
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, you.
You have a unanimously.
Thank
you members I appreciate this
very much.
Thank you. Alright, we have up
next.
How
284.
whenever you are ready.
Why don't you grab
representative Pettigres.
We are
whenever you are.
Mhm
Um, so members of the committee,
uh, thank you for taking the
time for this bill.
Queens is a house built 24.
Um, this deals with free roaming
horses.
I'm joined today by Sutton
and
all uh protection voters in New
Mexico.
So
I, I would, I would ask the
committee to to think about.
Wild horses in Western.
commercials and cigarette ads.
And
Because that's not
for a moment there.
Um, that's what we're dealing
with that's not the real
reality.
Um, what, what, what we have is
hardscrabble life, uh we have uh
depleted range we have.
And the reason is because we
have an overpopulation issue.
This still attempts to address
that.
In two main ways one is
providing a mechanism to provide
fertility.
so the horses.
With the substance known as PCP.
We provide um uh birth control.
Uh, it lasts for a year,
but they're they're they.
In the second method providing
an avenue for
adoption.
Of
If they have some place to go.
Um
So if there is room in the horse
preserve if there is room in
equine shelter if there is a
private adoption.
If, if the, the horse can be
rehomed, if you will.
Then they can be taken off the
range.
And only then
So a third aspect of the bill
which isn't one of the main
goals but the third aspect of
the bill which is really
important.
Is a prohibition on slaughter.
So if you take a free roaming
horse off the range.
And you subsequently release it
or transfer it, transfer it.
Or take it for slaughter.
That is a crime.
Uh, it's a misdemeanor
punishable by up to a year in
prison, a fine of up to $1000.
Each horse is a separate crime.
So if you take a truckload of
horses to Mexico for slaughter
for 6 horses, that's up to 6
years in prison.
Um
I view this bill not as a uh.
Solution, uh.
To free-roaming horse
management, but that's a step in
the right direction.
And in that sense it's kind of
like, you know, the crime bills
we look at.
You know, no crime bill is gonna
solve our crime problem. We chip
away at it we, we do what we
can, we try to make things
better.
And this does that. It's sort of
a a pressure release valve.
Where the pressure is the
population.
And the release is an attempt to
reduce the size of the herds.
Through adoption.
Relocation and, as I said, birth
control.
And that ends up being.
Good for the horses there are
rehomed.
And good for the horses they are
left on the range, because
there's less competition.
Um, how, how it works is.
We create a process in the
livestock board.
To designate free roaming horse
experts. It'll be a rulemaking
process. They can designate.
Uh, educational requirements,
experience requirements, things
like that, and this is in line
with responsibility they already
have.
Uh, designating certified
registered horse sanctuaries, so
there are sort of doing that
work and so that's why we asked
them.
Uh, to step up and do this.
And um they've agreed to do
that.
Uh, we are not asking the
livestock board.
To manage the horses.
Or to administer the PCP.
So the next step is once there
are free roaming horses horse
experts.
They can enter into contracts
with governmental entities.
Perform these services
So governmental entities such as
Saval County.
Uh, where Placidas is.
Would like to be able to manage
these horses they can enter into
a contract with a free roaming
horse expert.
And then with the permission of
the landowner.
And never without permission of
the landowner.
They can um administer the uh
fertility control.
And they can um
Uh, capture horses if there's
some place to take them.
And that's what this does.
So I, I mean, I think.
In some ways I, I, I wish I
could tell you we've solved the
problem, but I'm, I don't
believe that's.
True.
Um, I will say I, I don't think
I've talked to anyone.
Mm
Who doesn't think the population
of the horses is a problem.
So if we're providing for
fertility control and
relocation, I think that's a
good thing.
Um, I would like to give, uh,
each of my experts a brief
moment to, to chime in on this.
Thank you, Representative
McQueen. Good morning, Madam
Chair, members of the committee,
I'm Stacey Kirby with Animal
Protection voters for many, many
years, our organization has
worked with stakeholders, um, on
best practices.
of free roaming horses, the
current statute has been in
place since 2007, but as
Chairman McQueen so eloquently
laid out, there are so many
anomalies and gaps in the
current law that best practices
can't be implemented. For
example, uh, currently in the
law, there's a requirement to
administer a DNA test to
determine whether a horse is of
Spanish colonial lineage, uh,
before a horse could be
relocated, um, the
Administering the test is
unfeasible for a variety of
reasons, including the entity
that is tasked with
administering the test. I
believe all the members of the
committee have received a letter
speaking to that. Um, if the
horse was determined to be of
that lineage, the law requires
that the horse go to a preserve
specifically for Spanish
colonial horses. There are no
such preserves in the state of
New Mexico and very few across
the country.
Um, I'll just speak very
briefly, underscoring what um
Representative McQueen said
about the fact that the current
law actually doesn't prevent
Egregious harm to these animals.
House Bill 284 explicitly makes
it illegal to slaughter,
transport for slaughter, and
allows
Um, the free roaming horse
experts that would be registered
um by the New Mexico Livestock
Board to use the best science
and the tools that we currently
have to bring these free roaming
horses that are currently on the
landscape into balance with
wildlife and other human uses of
the land, we strongly support
House Bill 284 and I'd be happy
to answer any questions.
Good morning, Madam Chair and
committee members. My name is
Nina.
My name is Nina Adelman, and I
receive the equine program.
Uh, I have worked on issues
affecting free roaming horses
and collaboration with federal,
state, and tribal agencies as
part of through those tribal
partnerships, we are actively
pursuing projects to uh manage
herds on tribal lands.
So I have seen firsthand the,
the challenges and successes of
those projects, and just as
importantly, I've seen how much
humane and innovative solutions
are desired by communities and
how empowered those communities
feel when they uh do have the
expertise and the resources to
take herd management into their
own hands.
But while tribes have a
sovereignty over horse
management on tribal lands, the
current state law does not uh
offer feasible solutions.
24 in Sandoval County on the
horse herd and Placitas using
PCP fertility control, which has
decreased uh the reproduction
rate by 88% in five years.
But it still take time for the
population of the horses to go
down because contraceptive
horses still remain on the land,
and that's time that some of the
most degraded lands do not have.
So HB
284 provides a framework for the
humane and science-based
management of free roaming
courses using all the necessary
tools, which includes relocation
of those horses when needed for
their well-being and for the
health of the land while still
providing firm protections for
those forces against
mistreatment and slaughter.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
We're gonna go to the audience
for public comments. Uh, we will
start with those in opposition.
Um
You in, in the room, you have
one minute. Our attendant will
hold the mic.
The time starts as soon as you
begin speaking. This is for
those in opposition.
Good morning, madam chair uh
chairwoman committee members. My
name is Tom Patterson with New
Mexico Cattle Growers
Association. I'm a cattle
rancher from Catching County,
representing McQueen's comments
were spot on.
Uh, we have a problem with feral
horses. People sometimes no
longer want to care for old,
sick, injured, or just expensive
horses. They'll haul him to the
woods and dump them out to fend
for themselves. They become wolf
bait.
Feral horses can cause terrible
damage to our New Mexico
landscapes, particularly our
riparian areas.
We appreciate what the sponsors
are doing. We've met with them,
we've given them suggestions
until we see the next draft of
their bill, respectfully, we
have to stand in opposition, but
we, we appreciate the work
they're trying to do, and the
problem they're trying to
address.
Thank you.
Anyone else in opposition.
And state your name for the
record.
Oh
Hi, I'm Patience O'Dowd, and I'm
president of the Wild Horse
Observers Association.
I, an environmental conservation
group for since 2004, we're now
also a civil rights group. Um,
This is a repeat bill again and
again. The livestock board and
the BLM and the um horse
services have conflicts of
interest, uh, the one, the
horse.
would come into uh the NMLB with
that with whatever expert, that
wouldn't say anything about what
the BLM or the Forest Service
would be able to do, and they
with this bill, they would be
able to round up these horses,
and they'd be gone out of sight,
out of mind.
Um, there is no science to this
pill, you're taking away the
genetic viability of this bill,
um,
The, the reason why, uh, well,
states effectively own their own
wildlife and um the AGP time is
up. Thank you. Next please.
Uh, Madam Chair and chair people
here. Thank you for giving me
this opportunity, the one minute
to voice my opinion. I'm against
this bill. I grew up down in the
Tularosa area. My dad was an
engineer on the Pershing
missiles, and they did a lot of
test firing on White Sands
missile range. My dad took a lot
of photographs of the wild
horses, so I grew up with that
in our home. I was present when
the 2016 uh case against the
horses in Alto.
were picked up illegally
transported by the wildlife
board, so I don't have trust
with the wildlife board
overseeing this equine.
Facility or group of people to
protect.
Um
I don't believe that uh
They would do a job that would
protect the wild horses. It's a
different thing than having
strays or horses that have
gotten out and mated with other
horses.
It's a totally different issue
you, can you just state your
name for the record, please?
Julie. I'm sorry. Thank you.
Next.
Madam Chair Representatives, my
name is Sharon Elliohar. I
oppose this bill because
basically it gives control of
our free roaming wild horses to
New Mexico Livestock Board.
Under the current statute, they
do not have jurisdiction over
our horses. This bill would give
them complete jurisdiction to
make up any rules that they
want. I do not see anywhere in
the bill that talks about a
management goal of this bill
being to keep our
horses, wild and free roaming.
In fact, I look at the language
of this bill, it doesn't even
say that the horses are wild,
which they are, and it just
leads to basically removing
them, relocating them, removing
them from the land, but not
returning them. There's nothing
in this bill that would stop the
New Mexico Livestock Board from
removing our horses one by one,
separating the horses from their
family groups and putting them
in small tracts of land or
containment facilities.
And there's nothing in this bill
that encourages.
OK. Good morning.
This is my first legislature
ever. State your name for the
record, please. My name is
Lilian Gonzalez Pittman.
And I'm an heir to the canon de
Aguas San Pedro land grants and
our ranch borders the San Felipe
and the Santa Ana Pueblos.
Um, the reason I'm here today is
because I, a generational, uh,
Uh
Landowner and the horses have
been around us and with us all
my life and my father's lives,
my father's buried on our aunts
at this time. Um, I, um,
Mr. McQueen.
Your political platform should
actually prevent you from
presenting these atrocious
adversarial bills against our
defenses, wildlife and natural
resources and environment. I've
attended my very first
legislative Zoom meetings with
you and them, and you have yet
to say one good word for the
protection of
the wildlife.
The advocacy, please be um
I'm not sure
Yeah, there is decorum here.
She's got a few more minutes.
OK, so there are no uh preserves
because they have not been
allowed.
Because they won't work with us.
I actually have land that I
would be glad to open to horse
preserves, but these people that
are trying to make these
decisions for these defenseless
animals should not even be on
these panels. They should have
your time, your time is up.
Thank you. Thank you.
Uh, I want to remind the
audience that, uh, we don't do
any name calling. I, I don't,
uh, we're, we don't even call
people out by name, so please
don't do that. Um, anyone else
in opposition to this bill?
On the zoom.
Raise your hand if you're in
opposition to this bill.
We have uh Cheryl Gibson on the
Zoom, uh, Cheryl, uh, when it
says unmute yourself, please
unmute yourself and your time
will start.
Hello, can you hear me, we can
hear you. Thank you.
Thank you so much. I submitted a
letter at about one o'clock this
morning to each of the committee
members. I would like to point
out during this meeting that the
New Mexico Livestock Board has a
definite conflict of interest,
which is outlined in my letter.
I also would like to mention
that there's no FIR to estimate
the cost of PCP plan or the
fertility plan, whichever you
want to call it, for either the
PCP or to pay the expert, and
there is a plan to
charged the rescue facilities.
To care for the wild horses,
even though they're caring for
our own natural resources on a
voluntary basis. That seems
absurd. Um, this, I believe, is
a hidden plan to extirpate the
horses, since there are really
no provisions and rescue
facilities are overburdened, and
there's no money for PCP. I
really don't see a plan that
this is to help the horses.
Thank you for this opportunity.
Madam Chair, that is everybody
on the Zoom in opposition.
OK, now we're going to move to
public comment and support, um,
if you would like to make a
comment, please raise your hand.
You have one minute, please
state your name for the record.
The attendant will hold the mic.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Susan
Harrelson. I'm here representing
the Coronado soil and Water
Conservation District that's
located just north of
Albuquerque and includes the
area of Placidas.
Um, we support this bill because
we're seeing bad erosion and
watershed degradation on at
least 10,000 acres of land.
That's only in the Placidus
area, the same degradation is
happening in other areas of the
state as well.
Um, our native bunch grasses
have been grazed or trampled
into dust and replaced by
tumbleweeds.
The grass doesn't grow fast
enough to feed this many horses.
Our healthy grasslands are gone,
and that has implications for
all the wildlife.
From bobcats to birds that
should be living there.
The horse population is growing
across the state without
contraception, a herd can double
in 5 years.
So something has to be done
about this. It's not going away.
I know this is an emotional and
contentious issue. It's also
unsustainable.
And we think that this bill is a
good solution. It lets us. Thank
you.
Thank you, um, Madam Chair and
committee members Catherine
Brooks, Sandoval County
Commissioner District One,
Placitas is in my district, so
I've been dealing with um this
particular topic for um my
entire term. I'm in my 7th year
as a commissioner. Um, we began
PCP in 2019, and have
aggressively work to control the
population of our uh free
roaming horses in the area. I
can tell you.
that was driven, that decision
to move forward with uh land
management or herd management as
well as uh birth control was
driven by conflict in the
community by public safety
issues on the highway, including
165, 1 way in, one way out, 5000
residents.
Thank you for your time and we
appreciate your consideration
for house bill.
Thank you.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, Debbie Hughes with
the Association of Conservation
Districts. We do have a policy,
uh, we are very concerned about
the overpopulation and mainly
the, the land carrying capacity.
So I am glad to see this in
here, but um it it's not humane
to leave these horses in areas
where there's no feed and no
water, and we really need to be
looking at the, the range
conditions. Thank you.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, I'm
Belinda Garland. I'm the
executive director for the New
Mexico Livestock board.
We stand in support on a major
portion of this bill. There's
some of it that we still have
some questions about, especially
the crime of slaughter on these
horses. There could be some
situations that come up in, in
that area that maybe somebody
that buys a horse doesn't know
they they come off of a free
range.
They send them to slaughter at
some point. I mean, that's just
reality of life. Everything on
this earth dies, so like, we
have some questions and some
concerns about that area. As far
as this licensing and expert, I
think that's a step in the right
direction of doing something to
benefit these horses. Um, them
standing on ranges with no
forage for them to survive off
of, is not a good thing, and
standing in the roadways, um,
being hit by a car and then
s t an ding by the side of the
road with nobody to care for
them is not a good thing.
Thank you. Anyone else in
support?
Uh, those on the Zoom, if you
are in support, raise your hand,
and we'll call it your name.
Thank you, Peggy Roberts. I'm
going to unmute you and your
time will begin.
Um
Uh, piggy, you may need to
unmute yourself on your
computer.
Oh, I'm very sorry. Can you hear
me now?
Thank you, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Peggy Roberts. I live on
a small ranch in Placitas with
my horses. The neighborhood
where I lived no longer has
grasses for the horses or other
wild animals to eat or water in
the creek to drink, because
there is very limited vegetation
in the area. Some residents try
to keep the horses from starving
by feeding them. Currently, a
bale of alfalfa costs between
$16 to $22.
he's more expensive. One bay
will fill approximately 10
horses a day. I have seen up to
50 horses in a feeding location.
That's $80 daily of feed at a
minimum.
As well as the financial burden,
feeding locations cause food
aggression between the bands of
horses and semi-domesticate the
horses, which increases their
desire to interact with people
in hopes of food. The horses
cause major conflicts between
neighbors, destroy the
landscape, frighten people, and
cause property and vehicle
damage during the 12 years I've
lived in Pass, I've known of one
or two horses killed each year.
Thank you, Peggy. That was time.
Um, and we're not going to Oscar
Simpson.
Thank you very much.
I am a horse owner. I, I, my
name is Oscar Simpson. I've been
a horse owner for the last 35
years. I recreate with horses on
trail rides and exploration of
our public lands and I've seen a
lot of
Problems with feral horses and
abandoned horses. This is a good
bill and please support and pass
this bill. Thank you. House Bill
284.
Thank you, Oscar. That is
everybody on the Zoom and
support.
Great, um,
sponsor, would you like a moment
to address any of the naysayers.
Or the proponents of this bill.
Madam Chair, I'm, I'm appalled.
um.
Uh, Madam Chair, thank you, uh,
you know, I think there's a lot
of uh misinformation and fear in
coming from the opposition. Um,
I view this bill as proorse.
Uh, you know, we are reducing
the population uh through
Um
Basically through attrition, you
know, as horses do grow old and
pass on. We're trying not to
increase the number of free
roaming horses.
And that's challenging because
it's difficult to, uh, dart
every mire in a herd every year
and we know that horses still
get dumped.
So there are other sources of
population increase.
And then rehoming the horses
and, you know.
good homes, um, plus the
prohibition on slaughter.
This is a pro-horse bill that uh
like I said, it, it, it's a step
in the right direction.
But it's a win-win step in that
direction.
Thank you, ma'am Chair.
Thank you. We're gonna go ahead
and move to questions at
Herrera.
We're up next.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, um, thank you, uh
representative McQueen for
bringing this bill forward. I've
been to Placitas. I, I went on
the tour of the of the problems,
uh.
There and I know we had problems
in other parts of the state too,
and I actually, I think this is
a, you're right, a step in the
right direction, will it solve
everything right away now I
voted for your bill last time. I
think this is an improvement,
and I, I, uh, I really don't
have any questions except that I
just want to say.
this is a huge problem and yes,
it's an emotional problem. I, I
get that. I, I always get the
most mail on wild horse field,
so, you know, so whenever I see
somebody bring it up, I go, oh,
here it comes. But, but I, I
think we need to really do what
we can, and I think these are
the right steps, and I commend
you on that bill. I really don't
have a question.
Thank you, Representative
Zamora.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Uh
Madam Chair, I've known
Representative McQueen since I
started serving and I, I think
he's getting braver and braver
every time he brings a bill up.
So Madam Chair, uh.
Representative McQueen on a more
serious note.
Uh
On the bill it talks about.
Uh, on page 10, section A starts
on line 5.
Uh
It talks about a state, a county
or a municipality.
Or governmental.
Subdivision.
May enter into an agreement, so.
Is there gonna be any fight as
to who calls the shots, is, is
Cause, cause any one of these
can step up and ask.
For, for this.
Uh
Fertility program to take place,
but how, how, how is that
determined as to who has
authority over who.
Um, madam chair represent
Zamora.
Uh, so the expectation would be
that.
Uh, political subdivisions
would, would tend to exercise
this authority enter into
contracts.
In their areas of interest.
Right, so Sandoval County is not
gonna.
Uh, pay for PCP down in Lincoln
County.
Um, you know, they would focus
on Sandoval County, you know, it
does include other political
subdivisions that
Community of Placidus is not a
political subdivision, uh, the
land grant in that community is.
Um
If they had funding for
something like this. This is
something they could work uh
with the wild horse expert on.
OK. Adam Chair, thank you for
that answer. And, and I believe
it was.
Maybe last 60 day session.
That Senator Woods carried a
bill.
And I don't know if you were
signed on to it or not, but it
was given the counties.
The authority to deal with, with
the
With the horses, so
To me, I, I kind of like that,
that the counties that and that
way you wouldn't.
You wouldn't have the state.
trying to control because in
some parts of the state, we
don't have that issue.
Uh, we don't have wild horses in
in Curry County and
And a lot of eastern New Mexico,
uh.
So that, that's one of my
concerns a little bit and, and
it does, it just.
Just a question I wanted to ask.
I don't really have a heartburn
with it or anything like that.
Uh
And then it talked about on the,
on that same paragraph it talks
about.
Uh, carrying capacity in in the
land and everything, but uh it
doesn't talk about accidents. Is
there anything in the bill that,
that
But accidents like
Like cars running on the into
horses on the road.
Is there, is there any part in
the bill that
But
Would, uh
Maybe encourage or allows a
county or
Or a government entity to.
To push
For this program to be
implemented because there was
accidents on the road for the
safety of the.
Um, men er represents more a
couple things. Uh, first of all,
I failed to mention it, but
Senator Woods is my co-sponsor
on this show.
Um
Uh, in terms of whether um
Uh, political subdivisions are
motivated by accidents, uh, I
think you heard from
Commissioner Brooke.
Uh, this is a real problem in
Placidus, uh, the horses on the
on the road, dangerous for the
residents uh and it's obviously
dangerous for the horses as
well.
So, you know, we would expect.
That if we reduce the
population, the incident.
Of accidents would decrease.
But um,
You know, that's just sort of a
an indirect.
Uh, hoped for benefit the bill
doesn't specifically address
anything.
Um
Targeted at accidents other than
just reducing the population.
OK, and, and I kind of wish it
would.
If uh
If people are getting killed by
these wild horses, I kind of
wish it would mention it in the
bill. And then, uh
And then on page 11.
Uh
It talks to it and on line 11,
page 11, Section C.
It says nothing in the section
shall authorize a qualified free
roaming horse expert to engage
in management activities on
federal or tribal land.
So
Surely there's there's an issue.
And some of these horses can
cross out of tribal land onto.
Private land is it and how
Oh is that addressed or if the
horse is caught on, on private
land off.
Of any native land will then.
It wouldn't matter that horses
is considered.
Uh
Of, of tribal lands, so he
doesn't really belong to the
tribe once he crosses that, that
boundary.
Madam Chair, um.
Be cherubs and more, so it.
You know, it's unclear who could
claim ownership of these horses,
uh, other than maybe the state.
Um
Horses on federal land are
subject to a federal regulatory
scheme, uh, tribes are sovereign
nations, uh, in, in engage in
their own management activities
or not.
Uh, so, because this is a state
law.
And we limited the application
to
Uh, private and state-owned
land.
Um, but again, always with the
permission of the landowner.
So this could occur on state
trust lands.
Um, but only with permission of
the state land office.
Uh, in terms of ownership, yes,
the, uh, you know, the horses
move around, um, just like the
other wildlife moves around, uh,
in the activities, the, the
fertility control and um uh any
uh capture if any.
Uh, with only occur on um land
where you had the permission of
the land.
And then, uh,
Further down on the on page 12.
On line 18, it talks about human
use. It's we're we're, it starts
on on line 14 and it's talking
about carrying capacity, meaning
the number of free roaming
horses that are given.
The amount of land can support.
And it goes on down and then,
and then it, it, it uh states.
Uh, taking into account human
use.
Are we talking about cattle
grazing when we say human use
or, or what's, what are we
talking about?
Ma'am, chair representative
Samoa, um, uh, we have spoken
with cattle growers. That was
one of the issues they flagged.
Uh, I certainly think uh human
use includes agriculture, uh,
but that's the language we're
looking at clarifying there will
probably be some uh minor
tweaks, uh, before it goes to
the House Judiciary, and that's
something we can address. And,
and Madam Chair and Matthew,
since you, I mean,
representative McQueen, we've
kind of gotten to know each
other on first name basis over
the years.
Uh, since there are some
concerns with cattle growers.
You will be meeting with him
and, and, and, and discussing
their concerns.
Uh, ma'am represents tomorrow. I
met with Mr. Patterson
yesterday.
Uh, I actually
speak with him quite often
during this session, uh, and I'm
happy to continue that.
Yes, they, they, they do have
some concerns and and I'm glad
you're meeting with them and
talking with them. My, my last
and final question and, and I
think this bill.
Is, is a good step in the right
direction, uh, like uh uh
representative Herrera stated
earlier.
It's, it's a hard issue to deal
with. We we've been dealing with
this ever since I came into the
legislature.
And
Emotions run high and
I could see why I've, I've.
I've been right, I started
riding horses when I was an
infant. My dad would put me on
the ponies and hold on to their
clean and, and he's talking
about their main and
And of course, they wouldn't,
they'd be.
They wouldn't be broke yet.
Because I was really very little
and you, you, that wouldn't hurt
their back or anything. He put
me on them and
And I grew up in.
Went to breaking horses for
people and
I roped in competitions and
stuff and and took care of wheat
cattle all my life and
A horse is, is a very special
animal. They're, they're very
Uh
If you take a kid and you teach
him to ride a horse.
It brings out something in that,
in that kid that, that you won't
find anywhere else.
Teaches them respect.
It teaches them how to work with
an animal.
And it teaches them.
that, that the respect brings
in.
Some kind of relationship
between the animal and the
horse.
If, if you don't respect the
horse from day one, you won't
ever make a good horse.
And uh he has to respect you so
that you can overcome his wild
side, so there's a lot to that,
and I, and I can see where the
emotions come in.
My last question, Madam Chair.
And, and representative.
And it was mentioned in the
testimony and it was mentioned,
I'm sorry, I didn't write the
names down, but this young lady
here on the, on my left.
Is that this program's already
been implemented and used.
Why does this bill have to come
forth then?
If, if this is already
happening.
Madam Chan and represented.
Uh, cherubs and Samora, uh, I
think that's a good question.
Um.
The uh uh the PCP has already
been administered and I'll let
my experts address that. This
does um add further protections.
So it allows, it creates the
mechanism for adoption.
Currently doesn't exist for
relocation, which currently
doesn't exist. And it also
prohibits slaughter, and that uh
prohibition is currently not in
law.
So if, um, my address that.
The current, how are we
currently administering PCP?
Madam Chair Representative, uh,
so yes, this is currently um
There's an active herd
management plan in in Placitas,
which, as I mentioned, did
reduce the, the birth rate by
88%, um.
More specifically in 2019 when
uh pre-treatment, uh, about 24
to 27 folds were observed, and
then in 2023, only 3 folds were
observed after 5 years of
treatment. But, uh, to address
the question of, uh, why do we
need more?
And I think the biggest barrier
right now to comprehensive
humane management is that
there's no feasible way to
relocate uh horses and to
provide them safe placement and
to relieve the land and the
horses who um who suffer from
bad land conditions. So even if
the horses are treated with the
contraception, they still remain
on that land, so they're still
putting stress on that land and
putting the lands.
The lack of forage and lack of
water on the land is putting
stress on the horse population
and uh that is where we get the
reports of emaciated and
starving horses.
Um, I believe a few years ago
actually in Arizona in Navajo
Nation, there was nearly 200
horses died in a in a dirt, uh,
remains of uh of like of a water
source because they were trying
to get it water. So, uh, you
know, as we, as our drought
progresses as our climate
changes as we get hotter and
drier, these problems are only
gonna get worse, and that's why
it's so important to allow
feasible relocation of these
horses for their safety and for
the health of the land.
And I agree with you, uh, Madam
Chair and expert witness, that
this is a, a humane way to do,
do things and uh
Did any anything
Did any road blocks come in the
way whenever you all decided to
do the PCP in, in Placitas.
Um, Madam representative, I'm
sorry, could you repeat the
question?
Were there any roadblocks that
tried to prevent you from, from
doing the PCP program in in
Placitas to.
To keep the, the her size down.
And Madam Chair Representative,
um, I think you've heard from
several Plaita's residents about
the, the degree of controversy
and tension in the community
about any sort of management of
uh of the free roaming horses.
Uh, I don't.
Uh, I don't believe there was
roadblocks to implementing the
the fertility control, um, but
again, there are significant
roadblocks to comprehensive
management that includes, uh,
safe placement of the horses.
And removal of the horses from
the land.
Madame Chair and an expert
witness.
I guess
Were there any laws or anything
that prevented you or or created
roadblocks. I, I know that there
would be some controversy with
the people and, and, and
somebody wanted it, somebody
not, but were there any state
laws or anything that prevented
you from doing that?
And Madam Chap representative,
um, I don't have a
Currently state laws silent on
whether counties can start a PCP
program because current law
actually authorizes the uh
Southwestern Museum of Biology
to be the ones that uh
Assess the land and implement
um.
bid management plans.
Thank you. Thank you, Madam
Chair and thank you for the
answers, uh, uh, representative
and expert witnesses. That's
all, that concludes my
questions. Thank you,
Representative Zamora.
Representative Mirabal Moya.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative. Um, I have
um just a few questions. Um, I
am 100% new to this committee
and uh but I, but, but my um
biology teacher brain is, is, is
working through a lot of this,
uh, a lot of this stuff. So, um,
if you'll indulge me in a couple
of some of them you've touched
on, um, but, um, if you can
indulge me just a little bit
right now, who is responsible
for monitoring the carrying
capacity of a certain area of
these horses.
Uh, mean to represent Mirabal
Moya? No one.
So, um, so, uh, Madam Chair, so
right now there is no one that
is, is, is trying to watch and
figure out if there's too many,
I mean, you can see results, I
guess, you know, but no one is,
is, is monitoring that, um, for
those of maybe your experts can
tell me when, when that.
If we were monitoring or if, if
we were paying attention a
little bit, um.
The, when the population goes
beyond that carrying capacity,
what happens not only to the
land.
But my concern is more
importantly to the animals.
Um, uh, what, what happens to
that when that carrying capacity
gets, gets, uh, um, is over.
Ma'am chairs and Mirabel Moya is
let, let me clarify my last
answer. So if you look on page 9
of the bill.
Um, line 16, we're striking
language that's in the existing
law.
That designated the mammal
division of the Museum of
Southwestern Biology at the
University of New Mexico to have
a management role.
Um, as far as we can tell,
They were never really consulted
about that. They don't want it,
they don't do it.
Um, that's one of the things,
uh, we're trying to fix. So when
I say uh no one is responsible
for it, I think the more
accurate answer is no one is
doing it.
Um
And then that's your, your other
question, um, you know, the, the
horses because they are so
thoroughly and closely, um, uh,
grazing the land, it, it
suppresses really all other
wildlife. So you have, you, you
know, the whole, you know,
chain.
Um, if you're bobcats, you have
fewer, uh, you know, uh, mice,
uh, other species that they
would eat, uh, there's, there's
fewer, um, you know, ins insect
life because there's just not
the vegetation. It becomes a
very rocky train, uh, especially
around the Placidus area.
Thank you, um, Mr. uh, Madam
Chair, and, um, representative,
so, so right now if this does
not go through.
When there is too much and all
of these effects are being seen,
uh, not only to animals, land,
wildlife, everything, um, if, if
this does not pass, what can be
done to bring that down, other
than, I think you mentioned uh
some places you are uh using
the, the PCP, but other than
that, what else?
Um, ma'am and mayoral Molia.
This bill is trying to give,
give us additional tools. Um, I,
I, I think again the answer in
terms of what else is happening,
it's not.
See, and, and Madam Chair, I, I.
I, I personally, I, I agree with
this only because I have, I have
lived in northern Nevada and,
and in California, and I've seen
the difference between our
they're they're called wild
Mustangs, and I, I've seen the
difference in the hertz. I've,
I've, I've rode in the herds or
around the herds of uh uh in
northern Nevada where, where
they are allowed to be adopted,
and in fact, I've wrote many
adopted Mustangs and got the
privilege of trying to uh train
one to be
roping horse at one point in
time. Um, so, so those, so and
their herds are healthy.
They're, they, their land is,
is, is, is able to carry them,
and then I've seen the same uh
uh just a a few 100 miles um um
west in California where they do
not manage them and they just
let them go and they are sickly,
and they are a diseased and, and
everything else and they're not
and you're not doing the animal
any favors.
That you think you are, but
you're not.
Um, so, so I really think I what
I really like about this is the
adoption piece of it.
That if there are people out
here that will, that can, uh,
humanely take care of these
animals, um, or, you know,
Hey, we can turn them into rope
and horses, let's do that too.
That takes a lot of work because
they're pretty unruly, but
But uh, but, but hey, but that,
but those are the kinds of
things rather than them starve
to death.
out, out in the wilderness. So,
um, so I, um, so I, I, I
appreciate you bringing this
bill. Thank you.
Thank you there are still
questions. Representative
Matthews.
I'm sure, thank you. uh.
Representative, thank you for
Um
on it.
Um
And um
But I do have a couple
questions. Um,
My first question is uh how many
or where are their free
understanding.
Um, Madam chair and Matthews,
uh, currently there are none
because we haven't set up this
program, uh, but there are
Um, uh, individuals that, uh,
You know, work on these issues,
um, you've heard from some of
them in the, the public comment.
Uh, in support of this bill.
Um, so, you know, part of the
process would be to help uh
identify um those experts and
part of the process would be uh
to it's sort of a credentialing
uh mechanism for the experts
that were already aware
represented, so they are
currently no.
Roaming, free roaming horse
experts, so this means and
Matthews.
There are experts out there, but
you're correct, they have not
been certified or registered
because this program um
Hasn't been adopted yet.
Uh, Madam Chair, uh.
Um
Uh, I read in the comments, uh,
in the materials that
Well, you're proposing would
apparently conflict, is that,
could you?
Talk about that a little.
Um
Me cherubs and Matthews, uh, as
I mentioned, there's a separate
federal regulator regulatory
screens.
Scheme
Uh, and that's why this bill
only applies to um state land
and private land.
So, the bill does not apply to
federal land.
are
I know this is probably a hard
question to answer, but are most
of these free roaming horses to
each other's trying to kind of
figure out how you would draw
the line.
Um, madam chair, um,
Uh, Representative Matthews, so
there are different herds, uh,
there's a herd.
Um, in the, the uplands of uh
the Socorro area, which is on
Blem land, uh, which is, um, you
know, has federal the federal
regulatory scheme.
Um, the, the land in the
Placidus area is mostly private.
Um, there is some, uh, BLM land
further up.
And like, as you know, I mean,
you look at the surface
management of New Mexico and
it's uh it a checkerboard at
best. Um, so there is a mix of
lamb.
Um, but the, the intent of this
bill is that it applies in those
areas where the federal
government
Um, is not involved.
Ma'am, uh, representative, what
about the land around Riodoso,
ma'am, uh, uh, representative,
uh, there is, uh, there is a
large herd down in the Alto
area. Uh, it's largely on
private land. Uh, I understand
from the cali growers.
Uh, that they're working with
the Mescalero.
Uh, and, uh, about management of
that herd. So again,
this this bill won't impact uh
tribal land, and if the
mescalros are uh a partner.
Uh, in that man, that's
something we livestock.
Primary agencies bill correctly,
is that correct?
Man, that's correct.
Uh, although I want to emphasize
that we've only asked them to
oversee the program, not to
implement it.
So there was a question that
there was no uh FIR or no uh
assessment of the fiscal impact
of, of running one of these
programs, and that's because
it's beyond the scope of the
bill, you know, that would be up
to other governmental entities
who want to enter into
contracts.
Uh, with the free roaming horse
experts, uh, and they would be
responsible for funding those
programs that would not fall to
the livestock.
In the 77 8 section that you has
written.
Causes more
As many lawsuits none have
resulted this bill will
essentially be billed as not
answer the question do you agree
with their
Um, cherubs and Matthews, I do
agree with that assessment, and
that's uh the statute beginning
on PG of the bill.
Um, that we're replacing, um,
that statute uh has proved to be
unworkable. Um, that's the
statue where we, they named the
mammal division of the Museum of
Southwestern Biology is playing
a role. They, they really don't.
There's also a requirement for
DNA testing.
Uh, that doesn't happen. Uh
there's not a standard for
Spanish Mustangs to compare it
to, even if it did happen.
Um, so the statute has been
unworkable and as a result, um,
the livestock board in, in
really anyone um.
has been prevented from taking
any affirmative steps.
Uh, to help manage the hurt.
The exception being, as we
discussed, um, the PCP.
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, application.
And that
You know, Sanal County.
took that upon themselves. Um,
it's not clearly provided for.
Uh, currently in state law.
Part I read.
Um, talked about many loss, I'm
just wondering, are there?
And chair Matthews, there are
two court of appeals decisions
based on the existing statute,
uh, in the DNA testing in the
Spanish Mustang heritage, uh,
we're effectively repealing that
statute. So the basis for those
court of appeals decisions, uh,
would no longer be in state law
and we would have a path
forward.
Do you represent case? Uh, thank
you. uh, Madam Chair, I'd like
to make a do pass motion for do
pass for House Bill 284.
I have a GP pass, uh, by
Representative Ca, seconded by
Representative Matthews.
Representative Herrera.
Um, Representative Laura Gudena.
Yes.
Representative Matthews.
Representative Moya.
Yes.
Representative Rubio.
Yes
Ranking members.
Yes, and I'd like to explain my
book.
Madam Ba Keats.
and I'd like to explain my vote.
Madam Cha Ortiz.
Yes.
You have a unanimous due pass,
uh, representative Zamora to
explain.
Madam Chair, I, I think this
bill needs a little work yet. I
think uh representative McQueen
mentioned in his testimony that
That he's still willing to work
with people on it and change it
up a little bit.
I think this is a, a good step
in a, in a humane way.
To deal uh with wild horses.
Uh, and I look forward to.
To see how this, this all plays
out and hopefully we don't have
to come back and fix something
with it.
These authorities is uh evidence
in my own community coming from
Donana County, where we have an
incredible trade for and
opportunity for development in
the southern part of the county.
But Madam Chair, committee, uh,
we need to use brackish water,
uh, and treat that brackish
water to facilitate that
development so that we don't
draw fresh water from either
agriculture, uh, the
environment, or of course from
from people who are already
there. That same
exists all across our state.
And so House Bill 311, um, will
facilitate, uh, the, uh,
The use and the creation of
these uh partnerships. I do want
to stress, Madam Chair, uh, the
committee substitute, it
addresses a few different points
that were raised in the original
FIR. If I could go through
those, Madam Chair, really
quick. Please do. Thank you.
Uh, first, certified reclaimed
water is, um, we clarify that
the WQCC
Uh, which is part of the Mexico
Environment Department is in
charge of that. Uh, second,
Madam Chair, committee,
Um
more aggressive use of reclaimed
water, um, and we'd love to talk
about some of the examples that,
that where we think that makes
sense, um, but just as
background, those are the
concepts that, that exist in the
bill.
OK
Uh, we're gonna go to, um,
public comment. We're gonna
start with those who are in
opposition to this bill, uh, you
have
One minute, the attendant will
hold the mic.
Uh, and we'll, we'll go ahead
and start in the room and then
we'll go to Zoom.
So if you raise your hand if you
are.
Environment is enormous under
this bill, and we ask you to
vote against it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you. Good morning, Chair
Representatives. My name is
Colin Cox here on behalf of the
Center for Biological Diversity.
Managing our increasingly
limited water is critical to
life in New Mexico, but we must
be cautious when reusing water.
We must be aware of the health
and environmental risks.
Um, posed by certain sources of
wastewater, and we must ensure
that any reused water will be
wholly safe for its intended
use. For instance, no proven
technology exists to effectively
treat the 84 billion gallons of
toxic liquid waste generated
each year by the oil and gas
production in our state. This
waste, known as produced water,
is filled with hazardous
compounds including carcinogens,
endocrine disruptors,
radioactive materials, and
forever chemicals like PFOS.
HP 311 fails to establish
guardrails that will protect
human health and the environment
when reusing water. Instead, it
surrenders responsibility to
nonprofit corporations to
administer water quality.
Um
With standards established at an
unknown date and without
substantive requirements.
The voting boards of these
corporations, which have Thank
you. Thank you.
Anyone else in the room?
We're gonna move to Zoom.
Please raise your hand if you're
in opposition. Um, if you are on
the Zoom, I'm gonna ask you to
unmute yourself and when that
happens you time will start, so
we have indivisible.
Indivisible Albuquerque.
And
Thank you very much. My name is
Sandy Silberg and I'm with
Indivisible Albuquerque and um
we stand in opposition to this
for many reasons. I was just on
a, a hearing and listening to
the gentle uh leader from down
in Clovis, talking about the
PFAS contamination and how now
the farms and the land that's
down there is worthless. No one
will buy it. Uh, we can't use
the dairy products from that
area. We risk contaminating uh
water by
all of the leaks that occur with
the moving of this reclaimed
water, we need to know what this
reclaimed water actually is. We
started with fracking fluid
moved to produce water, reuse
water, and now we're calling it
reclaimed water. We need to be
scientifically based on uh how
we proceed with this and uh we
need to not have so many people
in the industry on the boards
overseeing these kinds of um
procedures and policies. Thank
you.
Thank you, Sandy. Uh, next up we
have Kaylee Shu.
Good morning. My name is Kaylee
Sho and I'm a community
organizer with the grassroots
Environmental Advocacy Group,
Citizens caring for the future,
and we are firmly against HB
311.
This is the kind of bill that
keeps me up at night as an Eddy
County resident that knows the
public health risks that
produced water poses.
This legis legislation lives in
a fantasy land where the science
has proven that tree to produced
water doesn't pose a public
health threat.
This is blatantly untrue, and
you needn't look far to realize
anyone that tells you
differently has a clear conflict
of interest.
While this bill will begin to
open the door to widespread
water pollution that harms all
New Mexicans. It will have the
gravest consequences for me and
my community, where we are
inundated with oil and gas waste
and where these quote unquote
water authorities will be.
I would ask her does she vote
today, you remember that
allowing a waste product such as
produced water to be treated as
anything other than toxic waste
will shackle entire families in
southeast New Mexico, the
decades of illness and cancer.
And what poison, what on
poisoned land we have left. That
is not a legacy I think you want
to leave behind. Thank you for
your time.
Thank you, Kayleigh. Uh, next
up.
Jenkins
members of the committee. My
name is Sophia, um, I'm here to
speak on behalf of Earthcare.
We're community-based
organization on the south side
of Santa Fe, as an organization
dedicated to education and
community well-being on Santa
Fe's South Side. We know that
when children breathe toxic air
or drink contaminated water, it
doesn't just impact their
health. It affects their ability
to focus, learn, and thrive.
Earthcare strongly opposes HB
311 as it undermines the current
protections we have in place
regarding our water and the
authorities responsible for
their oversight.
Creating separate bodies for the
oversight of reclaimed water
will not only lead to confusion,
and our recurrent water loss to
be undermined, but continues the
same risk of contaminating our
communities.
Do our work with families across
Santa Fe, we know how critical
clean water is for community
health, agriculture, and daily
life.
Many of our members are already
struggling with access to safe
drinking water, and this bill
would undermine the necessary
oversight to avoid catastrophic
consequences. We urge you to
vote no on HB 311. Thank you.
Thank you, Sophia.
Uh, OK. Next up we have somebody
who's unnamed, but your name is
Me host on the Zoom.
Please say your name for the
record.
Hi, uh, my name is Sarah Swati
call, so I apologize um for the
incorrect name. Uh, Honorable
Chair and committee members, the
Orwellian renaming of treated
fracking ways to reclaimed water
is very telling.
The idea that during a water
crisis, we would consider making
this so called reclaimed water
exempt from oversight by the
water quality Control commission
is absurd and endangers all of
us. Why does the reuse industry
want this? Perhaps because there
is no science proving that the
reuse of produced water can be
done safely.
By taking scientific oversight
away, they can reuse fracking
waste without worrying about any
rules about where it can be
used. It could end up in our
water, on our land in our food
without any protective
standards.
Once a well aquifer or surface
water is tainted, it is
extremely expensive and
sometimes impossible to
remediate. Putting local
reclaimed water authorities with
boards populated by industry.
I'm so sorry you hate your time.
Thank you again for making your
comment. Next up we have Julia
Bernal.
Julia, can you hear us?
Yeah. Can you all hear me? Yep,
we can hear you. Thank you. OK,
thank you. Um, good morning,
Madam Chair and committee
members. My name is Julia
Bernal. I'm the executive
director of Pub Action Alliance
and a tribal member of San Di
Pueblo, respectfully, we're in
opposition of this bill. Um, we
see it as a dangerous slope to
continue the pursuit of
Um, the reuse of treated
fracking waste. Um, it's not a
guarantee that the quality of
this treated byproduct of oil
and gas can ensure um long term
protections for public health
and environment. We see this as
another way to reuse uh produced
water for economic game and
ignoring the um
Public health and environmental
concerns that we're raising
today as a public organization,
we have talked to many of our
public community members who are
um not in support of the reuse
of produced water and
respectfully, we ask the
committee to oppose this bill.
Thank you.
Thank you, Julia. Next up we
have Amios Bravos. Please state
your name for the record.
Hi, my name is Sarah Canno. I'm
a policy specialist with Amigos
Bravos, a statewide water
quality protection and
restoration organization. Um, we
have a concern about why, why
new regulatory entities over
water quality are needed in
addition to NMED and OCD and a
concern that this would lead to
multiple entities and private
entities regulating reclaimed
water, resulting in confusion
among the public and also among
the regulated community. Um,
We're also concerned that HB 311
would undermine the proposed
guardrails on the use of
produced water that are
currently being considered by
the Water Quality Control
Commission and that therefore
they would put communities at
risk of exposure to toxic
chemicals. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Next up we have Daniel, Danielle
Pritchard.
Morning, Madam Chair and
committee. I am speaking on
behalf of hundreds of renewable
tals members.
Uh, as I am on the executive
board, I'd like to point out
that House Bill 311 is riddled
with problems as documented in
the fiscal impact report there
are issues with conflicting
definitions, no identification
of water quality standards to be
applied to reclaimed water,
ambiguity on certification
standards and conflicting lines
of authority between the
Environment Department, the
Economic Development department,
the water quality control
commission, the Office of the
State Engineer and these
proposed numerous reclaimed
water authorities. The office of
the State Engineer correctly
expresses concerns that the
bill's definition of reclaimed
water could encompass all the
water in the state.
Including highly toxic produced
water from oil and gas
extraction operations.
For these reasons and these
statements by others, I urge you
to reject this bill. Thank you.
Thank you, Danielle. Next up we
have Zoe Kraft.
Good morning, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Zoe Kraft, and I'm here
today on behalf of Yucca. We
stand in strong opposition to
House Bill 311 because this
would undermine the authority of
the water quality control
commission's oversight on quote
unquote reclaimed water, which
can also be produced water. The
primary issue is how this bill
exempts reclaimed water from
state laws for wastewater and
produced water, further putting
our communities at risk of
exposure to radioactive
components. It is important that
we follow the science, which at
the moment,
has made it evident that toxic
fracking wastewater cannot be
safely cleaned. We must hold the
industry accountable for the
toxic radioactive waste they
have created. The bill before
you before you totally fails to
hold them accountable for their
toxic waste, but rather creates
a new board focused solely on
economic development. In fact,
the bill before you would allow
industry to undermine the
authority of the water quality
control commission at a
hyperlocal scale, at the expense
of worker safety, public health,
and our environment. We urge you
to vote no on House Bill 311.
Thank you.
Thank you, Zoe, and next up we
have Oscar Simpson.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee, Oscar Sison
representing Rio Grande
Indivisible here in Albuquerque.
It's a, it's a New Mexico
chapter of a national
organization indivisible. This
bill will allow pollution.
To occur statewide circumvent
the water quality control
commission regulatory authority.
Basically, the FYR and people's
statements already made is
Tremendous reasons saying we
shouldn't even consider this
bill. Thank you very much and
please vote against House Bill
311.
Thank you.
Thank you, Oscar. That is
everybody, uh, on, oh, sorry, we
also have Joan Brown.
committee and um chair, thank
you. Um, sorry, I just finished
other meetings, so I'm just able
to jump on real quick just to
say I did send notes to the
committee, but um I'm a
Franciscan sister and um, you
know, I, I work with Frontline
communities in the Permian
Basin, and um other faith
communities all around the state
and I'm just very concerned
about this bill and just don't
really see the reason for um the
proposal.
And I think that it would do
harm to our communities and the
sacred place, our land and our
water. So thank you for your
discern and consideration.
Thank you so much. That
Concludes public comment, um.
Sponsor, would you like to
address any of that before we go
to committee questions. is there
room for support, madam?
Yeah, there is actually room for
support. I'm so sorry,
Representative Small, and those
who are in support of this bill,
uh, in the room, please raise
your hands. You have one minute.
Uh, the attendant will hold the
mic for you.
And please state your name for
the record.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, Debbie Hughes with
the Association of Conservation
Districts. We are in a critical
problem here in the state with
our water, especially our
drinking water. But this bill is
trying to do is set up a system
where we can do more municipal
reuse, which should not be
putting drinking water on our
parks and our golf courses, but
it's also trying to set up a
system where we can use decel,
um, the city of El Paso, most of
their water supply comes from
diesel, states all around us are
doing it. We are way behind.
And we really have got to do
this or we're gonna run out of
drinking water in several
locations. Thank you, Madam
Chair, members of the committee.
My name is Matt Minos. I'm here
forag New Mexico. We stand in
support of this bill.
Good morning, madam Chair,
members of the committee. My
name's John D'Antonio, former
state engineer and secretary of
the New Mexico Environment
Department, also current
president of the New Mexico
Desalination Association, really
concerned about our water uh
availability and supply, we have
another dry year, uh, the
communities in the state of New
Mexico are all challenged. We've
got an opportunity here to set
up a system where the locals are
in control of the water supply,
the rhetoric you hear about
water quality.
It's all under the water
quality uh control commission
standards, uh, it's there's a
lot of fear mongering associated
with the water quality
standards, and uh we're in
critical need of mechanisms, so
we, we don't run into uh uh the
disaster of running out of
water, OK.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee,
Clayton Abbey with the New
Mexico State University. We
stand in full support of this
bill. I want to thank the
sponsor chair is small, uh, as
many of you know, the Mexico
State University, we have
world-class researchers that are
working on all types of water
and retreating and finding uh
reuse that is in line with the
Mexico environment department
who we collaborate with
frequently, uh, so for those
reasons that
Those stated by others in the
audience, we stand in sport.
Thank you.
Uh, morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, Jason
Weeks to lobbyist for the
Albuquerque Hispano Chamber of
Commerce. We view this bill as a
really critical and innovative
way to actually um improve uh
the availability of water
resources in our community.
Economic development is hugely
reliant on the accessibility of
water and the availability of
water. But we think this does is
it creates an additional option
for accessing necessary water
that is going to be done in a
very clean and responsible way.
Other states are honestly.
of us in this. This bill seeks
to implement a framework that
those states have already
successfully implemented. So we
think that this is a way that
will actually help facilitate
and promote economic development
in our communities from big
businesses to small businesses
like those that the chamber
represents. Thank you.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Vanessa Lari. I'm a
registered lobbyist for
Borderplex. Additionally, I
represent other developments in
both Rio Rancho and Berlio
County. This is an exciting
bill, Senate Bill 311, the
committee substitute has
addressed many of the concerns
that were addressed with the um
opposition. I will say from the
perspective of my clients, this
provides us an opportunity for
jobs and economic development
using new technologies and also
filling the spots rudiment
rudimentary.
technologies with things like
dust mitigation and things of
that sort. We really strongly
encourage your support on the
committee substitute 311. Thank
you very much.
Anyone else in the room?
We're gonna move to Zoom if
you're in support, please raise
your hand.
State your name for the record.
for softly have a zoo.
Madam Chair, members of
committee. Uh my name is Pei Xu.
I'm a professor at New Mexico
State University. And the
research director of New Mexico
produced water research
consortium by working with
federal and state agencies,
industry, communities and
stakeholders, I fully realize
how critical this bill is for
improving water management and
the water security in our state.
The creation of reclaimed water
authorities could enhance
coordination among various
Stakeholders, which is currently
lacking. It will standardize the
certification process to ensure
water quality for safe reuse. It
will reduce the financial,
legal, technical, environmental
and public health risks of water
use that we all care about, uh,
NSU has strong expertise in this
field. We will provide the data
information, science, and the
technologies to support the
successful implementation of the
reclaimed water.
Act. Thank you for this
opportunity to support House
Bill 311.
Thank you, um, that
Now concludes.
Public comment for uh community
substitute for HB 311. Uh,
sponsor, would you like to
address any of the things that
you heard, Madam Chair,
committee, I would. Thank you so
much. Madam Chair Committee, I
want to unequivocally and
Uh, unequivocally say the water
quality control commission in
the committee substitute is
solely responsible to determine
the quality of water.
That is a key point. Uh, it's
been a key point.
Um, and it will, it is, it's uh
in this uh legislation, Madam,
Madam Chair and committee. So I
think that we need to trust our
state regulators. We need to
invest in our state regulators.
We need to invest our state
regulators with authority while
at the same time innovatively
um,
Sort of leaning on that
authority and opening up the
opportunity for uh
The um
Reclaimed water act and these
associations to do work.
Uh, but again, just to say it
one more time, Madam Chair and
committee,
the water quality control
is solely responsible for
determining water quality
standards.
And they remain that way.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you. Uh, we're gonna move to
questions. Representative Rubio,
you're first.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative.
I know a lot has already been
said on the environmental and
health risks and privatization
and the control of water, um,
and so the questions that I have
are mostly around getting some
clarity for myself, but also
just to get some of this on
record. Um, the first is related
to water rights and rural and
indigenous communities, how does
this bill protect Asea's
traditional farmers and
indigenous water use.
Thank you, um.
Madam Chair, and Representative,
this bill, I want to go and find
it here.
Um
It ensures that water rights and
perhaps Mr. Sayer has the page
number.
Uh
So on page 11, Madam Chair and
committee and Representative
Rubio, thank you for the
question. Um,
This is the reclaimed water
authority is subject to all
applicable laws and rules.
So, uh, the
Uh, reclaim water authority is
subject to all OSE
determinations on water rights
if so if water rights issued by
the state engineer.
Um, also, uh, that's a
1, Section 8A1, Section A, B,
the use of reclaimed water by an
authority shall not impair any
existing water rights.
And so it's the Madam Chair,
Representative Rubio in both
places.
Great. Thank you, Madam Chair
and Representative, so
proclaimed water then is
certified as no longer being
wastewater. Could this change
existing water rights laws.
Um
For that technical my
understanding is, Madam Chair,
Representative Rubio, no, I'll
go to Mr. Sayer for any
additional
and they analysis.
Yeah, Madam, um.
And a Rubio know the what's it
becomes reclaimed water,
certified reclaimed water, um,
that, that has no impact on the
on existing water rights, um.
Just an example if we were to
look at a municipal rate, um,
municipal rights have some sort
of return flow obligation, um,
and those return flow
obligations remain in place, um.
So to the extent there is
excess.
Um
affluent from a municipal
treatment facility that uh and
that return flow obligation has
already been satisfied. It's
that excess that would be
available.
Um, as reclaimed water.
OK. And so just to clarify and,
and just for the record.
Would this create any conflicts
between Asea tribes and
industry.
Uh, Madam Cher and Rubio, my
answer is no, and basically man,
Representative Rubio.
This is not going to deeply
existing water rights. It can't
impair them. It can't reduce
from them.
Madam Chair, Representative
Rubio, um, if local authorities
so organized under this act.
And at the standards set by the
water quality Control
Commission. It can uh offer the
opportunity for, for additional
water for other purposes, but it
doesn't displace or deplete
existing water rights or
existing purposes.
OK
Uh, thank you, Representative,
uh, thank you, Madam Chair
Representative.
Regarding the water rights
issue.
Can this water be used to
replace or challenge historical
rights, particularly when it
comes to legal protections that
exist to prevent that, at the,
at the current, at the current
time.
Madam Chair Representative
Rubio, no, I think that maybe
the best way to to characterize
it is the, the language in the
bill does it it does not
interrupt at all the existing
water right regime in the state
of New Mexico as it pertains to
a tribal rights, um.
And has appropriated rights so
it.
There's no language in the bill
that allows for an interruption
into the existing water rate
regime.
OK, um, Madam Chair
Representative, I just have a
few more questions and these are
related mostly to, um, the issue
of conservation and what I, I
feel is, is a lack of um
Of
Of that in this bill. And so,
the first question that I have
around that is, um, why is this
bill focused on reusing
wastewater instead of forcing
industries to conserve water.
Uh
Thank you, Madam Chair, uh,
Representative Rubio.
The
The focus on
Fundamentally, we need
new water for new industry.
There are very tight constraints
around efficiency, but Madam
Chair, Senator Rubio, that's not
the point of this bill. The
point of this bill is to uh open
up.
For in and take the pressure off
of existing freshwater or other
water resources for these new
projects and create a new
stream.
And so, Madam Chair,
Representative Rubio, it very
much.
is squarely focused on relieving
pressure on scarce freshwater.
Uh, resources, surface water,
groundwater.
And opening up a new opportunity
if communities want to do.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative.
As I read this bill, I feel like
it is something that we should
be challenging industry to be
more cons uh uh to conserve more
of their, of the water that
they're using, especially
because so many got up today to
say,
That they're all of a sudden
they're concerned about water,
but yet, the industry is
responsible.
A lot of, for the reason for why
we're having such an issue with
scarcity of water, and so,
wouldn't stricter conservation
policies be a better long-term
solution than this bill.
Madam Chair represent Rubio, uh,
I take very much to heart your
focus and emphasis on water
conservation practices and uh
want to think about this in this
legislation and other areas.
Madam Chair Representative, I
would say that this pill still
has a place there though,
because Madam Chairs
representative, um,
Particularly when it comes to
brackish water resources and
utilizing those.
Uh
It's sort of like in in down
south in Donana County. It's,
it's a choice between sort of
brackish water.
Fresh water slash surface water
or nothing.
And I think that's a choice,
Madam Chair, Representative.
Probably most parts of the state
face, not all parts of the
state, obviously.
Um
And, and that's where Madam
Chair Representative.
Great point and want to look for
ways to incentivize, encourage,
and require sort of the best
water conservation practices.
But um
Many parts of the state are,
it's a choice between that fresh
water or some sort of
particularly brackish water for
new projects.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, Representative. Um, I just
have one last question, and this
is
Goes back to just change the,
the Reclaim um of water.
Um
And I, and this is particularly
and I'm always hard on industry
and you know that, uh,
representative, um, and so
what's to stop industry from
using this as a loophole to keep
over extracting fresh water,
knowing that they can just
reclaim some of it later.
Uh, Madam Chair, um,
representative, I think the
Most of these these um
Authorities would be sort of
Two things. One, most of these
authorities will be in areas
like in Donana County where um
The industry is sort of clean
manufacturing, logistics, very
border and very trade sort of
focused and trade is gonna be a
very big part of many, uh, parts
of the state, Madam Chair,
representative, uh, clean energy
manufacturing is gonna be
another very big part of the
economy in all different parts
of the state.
And Madam Chair, representative,
I think in those areas,
It's
It's more focused on that choice
between freshwater or a brackish
water, the treated brackish
water or other wastewater
product.
Madam Chair Representative in
the areas of the state where,
uh, oil and gas is produced,
that's a big part of oil
conservation divisions
responsibility to continue to
work.
To, uh, lower the amount of
freshestry.
Finally, Madam Chair
Representative, again, very much
appreciate your point that we
need to be encouraging and
focusing on
The most water efficient
practices in industry and in all
other parts of the state and
during.
Thank you, Representative, uh,
thank you Madam Chair, that's,
that's all from me, my side.
Thank you, uh, Representative
Zamora.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, Representative, for
bringing this bill forward.
So
Why, Madame Chen and
Representative, why is it
important that that we
put together a whole other.
Authority
I guess that's what we would
call it, right? Not a
department.
Or would this be a department?
Madam Chair, uh, Representative
Samora, this would be a creation
of a reclaimed water authority
authorizing the creation of
those. It's important, Madam
Chair, Representative Zamora, so
that we allow local communities
and local public and private
stakeholders to be part of
solving their sort of local
water challenges.
Um
That's fine. And, and Madam
chair and, and Representative.
So
From reading all the analysis
and everything that I received.
I take it that enemy D.
Isn't real happy with this bill.
Madam enemyD outlined some
concerns, Madam Chair
Representatives and all that,
the committee substitute
addresses many of those concerns
as I went through, uh, capping
the number of water authorities
that can be created in the first
year, um, clarifying again that
the water quality control
commission is solely responsible
for water quality standards, uh,
adding the years, the 3 years of
experience to board member
qualifications.
Um, those are just some of the
different areas, uh, that, uh,
we adjusted in the committee
substitute.
To follow New Mexico Environment
Department's guidance.
So, uh,
And Madam Chair and
Representative, kind of clarify
for me as this bill been to any
other committees? This is the
first committee, Madam Chair,
and, and Madam Chair.
Uh
And this is just to, to all the
reps and, and, and how we
manage.
And operate here in Santa Fe,
uh.
With all due respect, Chairman,
uh, Representative Small.
Uh
We, we bring these bills
forward, and before they ever
hit us.
We get a substitute.
And then we don't know on the
analysis, according to to
represented a Small's testimony.
This has already been taken care
of, but
But in our heads and all the
reading we've done.
We have analysis that says enemy
is not happy with this.
And it's hard to deal with the
substitutes, uh,
Just, just me expressing my
frustrations. Maybe it doesn't
mean a whole lot, but
It's, it's hard to deal with
them, uh.
So
Madam Chair and Representative.
Why on page 18 of the bill on
section 15 starting on on line
19.
And I'll let you get to there
and.
rush you on that.
So, so why on section 15?
We start on line 2, it says
there shall be no requirement
that reclaimed water be
certified.
Is, is it, is it the purpose of
this bill to make sure that,
that this water
Is regulated in some form or
fashion and then all of a sudden
we take the certification out of
it. What, explain, uh, would you
explain that to me, Madam Chan.
Yeah, um, Madam Charing member
Zamora, um.
I'm sorry to interrupt. Can you
state the page number and line
against.
18, page 18 line 20.
Thank you.
Um, I'm just gonna reiterate
that.
We, we, we, we learned a lot
about this concept from
legislation that exists in other
states, um, in particular, we
looked at legislation from 2002
from the state of California for
better or for worse, that's
where it came from.
Um, and the California approach
here was much more aggressive in
essentially forcing market
participants to look.
Particular sources of water. So
this language here essentially.
It is a bit softer approach than
the California approach in that
it's not forcing these entities
to certify their water, but if
they don't certify their water,
they're not able to.
To to utilize the mechanism in
the same way certified water
would be able to, can we change
this mic out? It's, it's
breaking up and cutting out and.
Here we, they're gonna share a
mic, they'll throw this
out the window don't do that.
Sorry about that. I, I didn't
mean to be rude. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Um, yeah, Madam Chair, ranking
members of MOA, um, so just
highlights here.
We were trying to be less um
aggressive in terms of mandates
in this bill, then um, what we
saw in the legislation we were
looking at in California where
they, they effectively were
mandating certain things, um,
our approach was to um allow
these authorities and
participants in the authority to
move forward, um,
a bit more discretion. However,
if they determine not to certify
their water.
Then they're not able to
It, it, it's not going to have
the same opportunities move
forward as certified reclaimed
water would. So
In some ways, there's some
inherent.
Incentives to certify your
water. If you don't,
Then you're not going to have
those same opportunities, um.
And so that's, that's a bit of
the
Background on that particular
language.
You, Madam Chair.
That, that really
kind of gets to me that it says
there shall be no requirement
that reclaimed water be
certified. I just, I just think
we're losing the control.
Of that reclaimed water and then
it's uh it goes on.
On line 22 section B of that.
Be in section 15. Any person may
submit a request.
To water quality control
commission to adopt standards
and procedures for the
certification.
Of reclaimed water.
So by any person is
Is that somebody out in the
public or just who is any
person?
Madam Chair, ranking member and
yeah.
Anyone, and so again we're
trying to be consistent with
existing New Mexico law, um, and
For the most part,
The person can bring a petition
to the water quality Control
Commission for
And
That
That right there just confuses
because then there's no
requirement for it, but then any
person can bring it up.
And uh
I, I'll, I'll
that and go
On section D
further down on that. It's just
one a batch of reclaimed the
water is shown to meet the
standards established by the
Water Quality Control
Commission.
certified reclaimed water.
claimed water shill no longer be
subject to state laws.
Applicable.

Was retain the water.
So, so once it gets treated,
then it's not any longer
considered to be reclaimed

quite
reclaimed waters, reclaimed
water from step one to step step
A to Z.
And, and it seems like we're.
Run in this water around and
changing.
The same waters gets different.

I'm looking forward to
Certification to it.
It's still the same water.

an example when your

come from in Las Cruces.

As representative, that's.

and Mexico.
That's the only water you'll
find with fish in it. Uh,
of irrigation.
Madam Chair representative.
I think right now we have
One source of water that goes in
is treated and cleaned.
And then comes out that's just
part of how water works.
all over the country, Madam Cha
representative.
Um
In this case,
Uh, certified reclaimed water.
is
to have been uh certified by the
water Quality Control
Commission.
And Representative, the previous
um
Uh, focus if, you know, when
you're
mixing concrete for.
example, but I'm sure I'm
represented. There are other
applications for.
Uh, reclaimed water that are uh
entirely like a closed loop
system.
That are different from
Uh, what the
But, yeah, and Madam Chair and
representative that brings me to
my last question.
is
This bill
is being brought forward.
Is it specifically?
project in southern New Mexico,
uh, Las Cruces, El Paso, uh, Las

to do so.
Area, is that, is that why, why
this bill is, uh, uh
Is that what this bill is
addressing,
Madam representative, that's one
of the areas that will benefit,
uh, or very much could benefit.

And representative so.
So that
There is a project that's being
looked at.
Southern New Mexico.
And
Why couldn't

forward or or
the issue. Why, why are we not
letting an AED take care of
these issues that that this bill
address is. Thank you, ma'am,
sure. Thank you very much to
support the rest of the state as
they seek to
Madam Chan and Representative,
can you be a little more clear,
why, why is an MED.
like getting kicked out of the
picture here, Madam Chair.
enemy is still in the picture of
water for certified reclaimed
water.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, Representative.
Thank you. Uh, we have.
Madam Chair, um.
Bill
Um
I'm going to
colleague
the bill
Original bill and I read the
comments. I thought we're gonna
get.
a number of substantial
problems. It's.
I

So
Do my best to ask a few
questions.
So just, just an initial
question, on page 2.
Uh, definition J or
water.
any type of water is water.
been treated mechanically or
chemically, uh, would that
include produced water.
Madam Chair
Um,
Matthews
Uh
Language is relatively agnostic
about water source.
I'm just gonna give an example
To the
Partnership

development opportunities that
knock on.
Mexico Partnerships door
to for for help facilitating.
Their investment in New Mexico.
Um
Partnership engage
with them
Mexico Partnership does not
authorize anything.
A morally
Reclaim water authority.
Like the
ical partnership put out on
basis
So they would be in.
power to
To champion
It
clean water sources in
Area
They would not be able to move
forward with any water source
that did not have a legal
pathway.
And so
Speaking to
What water is included
It's, it's relatively agnostic
about water.
Sources
But there must be a legal
pathway to reuse whatever water
source.
You
The proponent is trying to use
today, there is not a legal
pathway to.
treated produced water.
Um
So it's
included because the definition
is broad.
Small small as was mentioned.
Were
on the water quality control
commission for the standards.
authority, the local authority
It's not setting standards.
had a representative. This is
agnostic and so it does not
exclude produced water, Madam
Cha represented.
I want to again reaffirm.
Then
Water quality control
commission.
is fully in charge.
Of any ways that produce water.
can be utilized outside of the
oil field, that's existing law,
that's not changed here.
So Mas representative.
water quality control
commission, our state
regulators.
is and will remain in thank you
for the answer.

But um

Matthews, the

It seems
I, I guess one of my questions
is, well, policy question, but
We're delegating a lot of
authority about water.
Um, somewhat potentially

And why is that a better
approach?
Statewide planning mechanisms.
This

Developing uh uh
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you,
Representative Matthews. Uh, so
current water rights law and
water rights are not impacted at
all by this.
So the um Madam Chair
Representative, all of
All existing water rights are
not impacted by this.
There are localized wastewater.
Dreams or brackish water
aquifers, Madam Chair and
representative that are unique
to local communities.
The same brackish water aquifer
that exists under Donana County.
It's not the same aquifer that
exists under Sandoval County.
Madam,
uh, however,
For, uh, certified reclaimed
water, the standard, the sort of
what comes out.
That should be governed at a
statewide level.
And that is governed at a
statewide level by the uh
further, Madam Chair
Representative.
Encouraging different parts of
the state to pursue strategies
that
Minimize freshwater use.
That maximize maybe using
brackish water for new economic.
I don't think that that's a bad
thing. That's gonna help those
Regions, it doesn't affect water
rights, it doesn't affect
surface water. It'll help those
regions, uh, grow their economy
if they're interested in that.
And Madam Chair, representative
that's OK too. They're, they're
not required.
Thank you, uh, Representative
Mirabala.
Thank you, Madam Chair. um,
thank you, Representative, um, I
am trying to keep up with a lot
of the questions that I put down
or get asked, and then I'm
trying to keep up which ones I
still have left, so bear with me
here. Um, the very first, I
guess I can go.
Um, I just wanted to make sure,
cause again, um, my, uh,
Me being a, a, a freshman in,
in, in this uh in this
committee, um, so I don't know,
I'm, I'm not versed in in as as
a lot of my other colleagues
here are with all of the stuff
that's going on, um, and, um,
and I know you've touched on it
a little bit before on page 2
where it does give that um where
what reclaimed water is there
on, on, uh, line 21.
Um, and then it's, and then it
says the that, uh, you know,
gives you all of the, the ways
or the water that you can be
used, once it's meets water
quality standards issued by the
state. So are all of those
specific water quality
standards, which I would, which
I, you said is the water quality
control commission that does
that, are they already set for
all the different types of, of
water that people are concerned
about, or is it just certain
ones that they already have
standards, and they haven't
established standard.
for others.
Madam Chair Real Moya.
The water quality control
commission can and does
continually uh respond to new
conditions and set new
standards, uh, in answer to an
earlier question, Madam Chair
Representative of Bob Moya, they
can be petitioned by members of
the state of New Mexico.
To set a standard, look at a
certain feature, and that's,
that's their job. That's so they
can set new standards, Madam
Chair and Representative Mal
Moya.
So, um, so thank you, Madam
Chair, um, so as of right now,
not all waters were that that
are defined under here have
certain standards, but they can
be done later, correct?
Madam Cher me about representing
me about Moya, yes, that would
be my, they'll, they'll have
many standards that may apply
here, Madam Chair,
Representative Bob Moya, if they
need to create new standards
based upon um scientific data in
their reasoned expertise, then
they definitely can.
OK, thank you, uh, Madam Chair
and Representative, um, the next
one, on page 3, I had a just a
little quick question when it
talks about, uh, starting in
line 15, um, that, that in
response to a request from
municipality which I like the
fact that it's not something
across the board if that um area
wants this, they can, they can
do this, um, but what happens
is, is there anything in here
that what happens if, let's say,
um, the city wants it, but the
county doesn't.
or a certain area like if
there's conflict within and and
they all pretty much have the
same authority or share of the
water or, or the, or the rights
to this, what happens there?
Representative Mirabel Moya, um.
The, the, the, the boundaries of
the authority would be.
would adjust, right? Based on
who the applicant is. So if
it's, if it's the county, then
it would be the boundaries that
the county defines if it's a
city, so just, you know,
subsidiary within a county then
it's gonna be a smaller area
without authority would be
working with him.
Thank you, uh, Madam Chair, so
basically whatever water they
are in that jurisdiction with
that's the only authority that
they would that they would then
um um issue all of this stuff
with, cause you're giving them a
lot of uh a lot of the
I guess authorities in that in
that process, but just that
part, right? So if other, if
there's conflict, it doesn't
expand across there, so you're
not taking other water that they
don't.
Other people don't want to.
To give you that right for,
correct?
Correct, Madam Chair,
Representative Min.
Yeah, um, and just to, to
clarify.
There there actually are not a
lot of authorities given to the
these particular authorities um.
the main authority giving to
them is, is the ability to to
attempt to play matchmaker,
right? To, to find existing
sources of reclaimed water and
find demand for those sources.
Um
Thank you, uh, Madam Chair,
let's see, I, she already
answered that one.
OK, OK, so, um,
One of my, let's see who this
is.
The Department of Justice.
Um, and there are significant
issues, um.
Area
They, uh, Madam Chair, they,
they, they put in there that the
delegation of authority to a
nonprofit to assess penalties
may uh um.
Ray constitutional issues, how,
like, can you speak to that
because in here there is like
fees and assessments uh within
the authorities, but then we're
still calling it a nonprofit, so
how, how does that work? Is
there, how can you speak to that
potential of constitutional
conflicts.
Yeah, thank you, Madam Chair,
Representative Midable.
Uh,
we, we did make some adjustments
to clarify because I think it
was to some degree the lack,
there was some ambiguity about
what those fees and potentially
penalties would be related to.
Um, so the language that we
added clarifies that fees would
be for administrative costs and
to the extent there were
penalties, those would be.
Only relevant in the context of
violations of rules and so it
it.
We think that that that
delineation of, of kind of fees
and potential penalties, um,
mitigates concerns about that
they expressed in the Attorney
general's position, um.
Perfect. Thank you. Um.
Let me see. OK, so, um, I have
another.
I think the rest of these might,
OK, so let's go to page 7,
when it gives you the, the
powers and duties of of of the
um these um.
Reclaimed water authorities.
Um, on
Line or or subsection or
whatever of 5, where it says er
operates, maintains lawfully
permitted water treatment
facilities, uh, desalinate
desalination plants, all these
other things. Oh.
operates them now. So you're
basically giving them the duties
to be able to do this, but who,
who operates them now?
Madam Chair Representative Mirel
Moya.
Existing treatment facilities,
um, are operated for the most
part by um either utilities or
municipalities, um.
And so what
In the context of reclaimed
water.
Most of those of these, you
know, forward looking water
facilities um don't exist today.
Right? So if you use represent a
small's example, um, this entity
that is looking to invest in the
Tonya and the county area if
they are going to pursue um
utilization of treated brackish
water, it would need to
construct a new facility. So for
the most part, these would be
facilities yet to be
constructed, um, and so
ownership.
It is, it is kind of a, a
flexible, um, point.
In the legislation in the bill,
um, because the authority is
able to own slash operate, but
Does not need to. So project
proponents think it think it
makes more sense for
Um, you know, the water
supplier.
To own or operate the facility,
then, you know, the project
proponents would engage with the
authority to determine what
makes most sense for the
project.
And and thank you Madam Chair
because that, that, that kind of
clarifies some stuff for me
because one this entity or this
this municipality is asking for
this to be created. And then if
they are already operating it,
they're willingly to giving you
that authority to be able to do
that, correct?
Madam Chair Representative of
Mid
correct.
So, uh, Madam Chair, so it's not
something that they're like,
you're, you're uh authority,
your water, uh, reclaimed water
authority is coming in and
taking over, right? It's, it's,
it's, it's a voluntary type of
thing.
Um
I think um
I've, I've heard in, in, in some
of the, the, the, the comments
that this is
Many say that this is um.
Already being done, uh, Madam
Chair, so, uh, why create more
government is what, what is,
what is the, and, and that's,
that's what I hear.
In in certain things, so I just
kind of wanna ask like, why does
more government, because this is
uh another government energy uh
entity basically, even though
it's voluntary. Um, if it's
already being done.
Representative Mill
Mirwa Moya, um.
In so many ways, it's not
presently being done.
Um, we, we have
What, what I'm continue to call
non-traditional water resources.
Because they're non-traditional
when a potential investor steps
into the state of New Mexico
looking for you know to to
develop.
Particular resource um.
We just don't have.
A lot of information about some
of these resources, where they
are, you know, quantities of
them, um, and we don't have
anyone at the local level
necessarily championing or even
at the state level championing,
you know, these water resources
um as an investment opportunity
and so just I'm gonna go back to
representative small's example
because it's a very recent one
that's very relevant. When, when
this particular particular
entity stepped into the state of
New Mexico.
They, they need
Surface, they need land. They
need energy and they need water
and trying to identify the water
resources.
Has been a fraught exercise
because we don't have
Unappropriated water.
Right
And so where they, we have to
get really
The exercising due diligence is
a robust one to try to identify
those water resources. If we had
a local entity that was
championing what they have
locally, and when that entity
steps into the state of New
Mexico, they in Donana County,
they say, let's talk to the
authority. What, what water is
available here and they, then
they, they pull out their
inventory and they say, we've
got this, we've got this, we've
got this, this is the investment
necessary to develop this
resource. This is an investment
necessary to develop this
resource and so it just becomes
much more readily available.
And
Which I think is super relevant
because we don't exist in a
vacuum and some of these
entities entities can just as
easily take their investments
somewhere else where the water
resources are more readily
available.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I was
just gonna, I was just gonna say
that, especially being so close
to El Paso, and, and I believe,
uh, the representative said that
El Paso is, is, is using already
using a lot of this and uh and I
think a couple of um other
people that have testified um
mentioned that that it's uh that
could be a deciding factor of a
manufacturer coming to New
Mexico versus going to Texas,
um, because they have the water
available and the authority to
be able to use it and when we do
not. Now I have had the
privilege of um
touring to Santa Teresa and all
of that in industry area, and,
and I know it's booming in it,
and it's, and it's uh continuing
to grow. I personally would
rather use other reclaimed water
than our fresh water in order to
be able to do this, um, so, so
thank you, thank you for your
answers.
Thank you so much. Uh, we have
more questions from committee
members, uh, representing Lara
Cadena.
Thank you, sponsor.
Um
I've been doing my best to
follow. I mean, I'm a little bit
confused at this point, but I
appreciate that we'll have a
good debate in front of us.
I
Surface level talking about
water.
What are the implications of
this bill beyond the authority.
So, for instance, as I read the
definition section.
Under new material definition of
certified reclaimed water. Is
that new material in this act,
or is this something we're
actually establishing across New
Mexico statute that is not in
place today.
So,
If you could start on page one,
line 25, the definition of
certified reclaimed water, would
we be establishing that in New
Mexico law for the first time.
And then otherwise, uh,
sponsored to answer, what, what
else is this still doing beyond
the creature.
Madam Chair, Representative Lara
Karena, um, I'll answer the
first question and
Correct, this definite or this
term is not defined presently in
New Mexico statue, um, or New
Mexico rule.
Um
We have a definition of
reclaimed water in guidance um
and we've looked to
Um
Thank you, Madam Chair, um, to
just the larger question then,
we've had a lot of debate around
the authority and what it does
and what powers it holds.
Um, to me that's somewhat like,
I appreciate that you have an
economic development intent,
that is not my expertise.
I feel like we have a lot of
economic development arms in New
Mexico that are quite unfamiliar
to me and including the one that
you referenced early on, like
I'd never heard of the New
Mexico partnership.
I've heard some about Rita and
have lots of concerns about what
it does and doesn't do. So we'll
talk about the authority piece
in a minute, but
That is pretty significant to me
that we'd be actually
establishing what sort of fade
reclaimed water is, and what
other parts of the bill are you
establishing something that is
beyond making the
Um, Madam Chair, Representative
Lara Helena,
um.
We don't have in the state of
New Mexico.
Legislation or rule.
That has introduced this concept
in terms of, you know, in a
robust way, reclaimed water.
Um
In that regard.
the state of New Mexico.
I'm going to use language that
I've, you know, borrowed from um
Western states.
they looked at the reuse
paradigm in the state of New
Mexico, um, they characterized
our, our, you know, environment
as a patchwork because we don't
have
Pensive or or
robust.
Um, set of words on paper
governing reclaimed water.
And so
In terms of what does this do?
Beside, uh, I'm having a hard
time, I guess understanding
that.
Your question because I think,
Madam, I can ask it in another
way because in my sense and read
of this, the closer I got to it
and and closer into the
committee step.
I actually appreciate that we
have this gap and that you're
trying, but to me now, we're
having that debate within the
context of setting up regional
water authorities, which is
muddying a bit.
From my perspective, what we
should actually be discussing
and debating. So, I'm not sure
how I feel about 10 authorities
going up across the state, but
I'd actually like to hear with
more clarity what it is you all
think we need to do about
establishing
The language on the paper as it
relates to reclaimed water.
Whether it's certified reclaimed
water, treated reclaimed water
like what you all think our
jurisdiction should be.
When it comes to reclaimed
water. So in my mind, I'm like,
can we put aside, well,
including why these are in the
same bill. That's, of course, we
as policymakers want to have
integrated conversations. So I
appreciate the intent, but more
clearly would like to better,
would want to better understand
what you are seeking to
establish and propose when it
comes to the layout of reduced
reclaimed water use in New
Mexico.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I, um,
if I may, Madam Chair, and
Representative Lara Cadenas sort
of looking at the time. I know
we're very late in the day,
Madam Chair, if I, I think we've
had really good questions. I
apologize for a lot of Cadena
for not getting all the way
through yours.
Ma I'm sure if I might, I've
asked that we could roll this,
uh, if, if, as soon as possible,
I know a lot of us will be here
on Saturday for different
things, potentially the floor,
but it's been great questions,
Madam Chair. Uh, I wanna make
sure that we take the questions
and feedback.
And work on those and we'll do
that very earnestly and try to
have uh
Um, and answers to the questions
have been stated, visits
offline, see if there's some
other concerns, things that
folks are thinking about and
work to address those, if that's
all right, Madam Chair. Uh, yes,
that is, that's fine. Uh, there
are lots of questions remaining,
uh, so we will do our best to,
you know, I have to talk to the
committee about what a Saturday
looks like because I know other
folks are in other committees
and presenting other bills, but
we will absolutely let you know
as soon as possible what that
looks like, and there are still
lots of questions, so I think
people are
really interested in what this
does. So thank you for that. Um,
we're gonna go ahead and adjourn
this meeting.
Uh, and until next time.
Thanks everybody.
Minnie's adjourned.
