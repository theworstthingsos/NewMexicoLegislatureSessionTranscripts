Come to order
Senate majority of Florida,
Peter Wirth to take us to that first
order business. Thank
you,  Mr.  President Unanimous consent.
We go with that our business announcements and
miscellaneous hearing, no objection.
We're in that order business announce
this miscellaneous Senator. Uh
Thank you,  Mr.
President. I want to start by
just thanking
the New Mexico Ag group
who brought us dinner uh
in the lounge tonight.
Uh More, more than a
dozen producers
specializing in a wide
range of foods, fibre
wine, uh and
each item served tonight
symbolizes an exceptional product
cultivated right here in New
Mexico and
we certainly appreciate
that coming from,
from them.
Um We
used to, we've done in the past the
ag fest and this
is what we did tonight in place of
that. So we're very appreciative about,
about that uh
tomorrow night.
Just a reminder that we will
have our traditional
last evening
Chinese dinner, uh
which will be
uh brought to us and we
appreciate all the sponsors who have
made that happen.
So  Mr.  President,
what we're gonna do
tonight
is as
members come back, we're going to
start with
a very
important certificate
that Senator
compos is going
to lead the effort on.
Uh, and then I will give
everyone a
roadmap when we get done
with that, uh, for where
we're gonna go. Um,
initially I had this morning, I
had mentioned kind
of one bill on a supplemental
calendar. It now looks like we're
gonna have six
on the supplemental calendar that are
being read, read in. I have
visited with, uh, Senator
Baca and,
uh, again, he's aware of these
and we'll let everyone know
upfront just for the
public. These are coming out of the
committee process. So
we'll go ahead and roll the clock,
um, which we need to do
and then get a supplemental calendar.
And so I'll announce those and get
the supplemental calendar handed out
as soon as we get it
prepared. Uh, so
with that,  Mr.  President, I
would yield to
Senator Pete
Campos. Thank you, Senator
Peter Wirth. I'll yield to
Senator V Campos.
Thank you very much,  Mr.
President, members of the
Senate.
This is a,
uh,
a delight this evening
and I hope that as members
have had a chance to
reflect on the day
and of course, have
eaten maybe a
good meal. And
along with that thought a
little bit about
what it means is we come
to close
to the end of a, a
30 day session,
how we,
uh, a big
family and yet at the same
time, or maybe
some of these family members
will
moving on
it takes a lot of courage
to go ahead and move on, especially
after quite a few years
here. But the
individual that we're going to be
recognizing
tonight
will always be in our
hearts
and deeper than that
with what he has done for
each and every one of us,
each and every one of
us. I hope
that we're able to
recognize all
of that within a
short time
span of 30
minutes.
And then from there, be able
to applaud
this individual,
wish him and his
spouse,
his family, the extended
family. Well,
so
with that,  Mr.  President,
I'm gonna defer
back to you and then I'll let
you take the next
part and then I'm ready to
chime in after that. Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Pt
Campos.

Peter Wirth
Mimi Stewart, President
pro TEM Sherri
de Lujan, chief clerk,
New Mexico State
Senate. Thank you
to our reader,
Senator Campos. Thank you very much,
Mr.  President. I'm just gonna
start to indicate very
directly with all my
heart, Senator
Tip Pino. We love
you,
Mr.  President. We're
open now to other
senators to
offer if you will,
they heartfelt.
Thanks and who
knows where this is headed?
Thank you very much,  Mr.  President. Thank
you, Senator Campos. We do have
several senators who would like to
speak on this. I'll begin
with Senator Steinborn, Senator
Padilla and Senator
Morris.
Thank you, Mister President
Jerry.
And what big shoes
you are going to leave that
really cannot be
filled. And that's a cliche
sometimes but not in your
case. I've
had the privilege of serving on your
committee. I was a
house member and came over
and in the
tradition of you and
Spack Orach
now and Dd
Feldman before you and
the people that work with you, Barrick
and your whole team.
I mean,
um really the
kind of the conscious of New
Mexico,
um
the knowledge that you bring
to the issues you work on
are just have been
treasured and
appreciated by me and
so many in this
state that know your work.
And
uh
man, not to mention your Skyhook
on the basketball court.
It is unbelievable. You
still got it. But
anyway, I just want to thank
you Jerry for all your public service
for New Mexico. And I hope
that we can find creative ways to
keep you involved and that you still
stay involved because you still got it
all man. And uh
congratulations on taking more
time for yourself. But
um you still have so much to share
with the state. I I hope you
continue to do so
appreciate you. I love you,
Jerry. Thanks. Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Thank you, Senator
Steinborn,
Senator Padilla.
Thank you very much,  Mr.  President.
I do I rise and support
and I just want
to say what a true treasure
Jarro Theo is to the
people of New Mexico.
You know, when you were talking
during the reading of
the reader was reading the
background information and, and
I'm sorry we were talking about
his family. I thought
Jerry's immediate family, Mister
President was a lot larger.
And the reason I think that is because
it seems to me like every time I look
over there, there are members of his family
here with him. And so
that I think says a lot
about, I have to beg my sons, Mister
President to want come over here
sometimes. And so uh
the fact that, you know, the family
is around him all the time and loves
him so much. I've
got to know several of them
in different capacities and different
roles. And it's really
impressive.  Mr.
President, my sons have both
chosen the same career field
that Senator Jarro these Pino
selected and
one of my sons had an opportunity
to hear Senator
Orii Pino speak at
a social work
workforce symposium
last year. And
uh he's the one the son that was with
me about two weekends ago
and he was so over the
moon about the speech
and the heartfelt
direction to a
room packed with
folks that have made social
work a profession. So,
uh I, we thank you, we love
you. And I, I really like what was just
said, which is, um,
you have so many decades
left in you of work to do
and I know this isn't the last
time we're gonna be talking about your
accomplishments because I know you're gonna get a lot
more done. And I do have to say
Mr.  President, I did receive
uh four minutes of play time in the
basketball this game this
year. And, um, I
don't know how Senator
Pino does it. I mean, he
was just back and forth back
in the, I was, I thought I was going
to pass out after four minutes.
And so the, the and then that,
that shot, that he made, I
mean, truly remarkable.
I think it was the highlight of the 12
years. I've, I've been a part of this
team. So thank you,  Mr.
President. Thank you, Senator, the
subin, thank you, Senator
Padilla. We have Senator Morris.
Thank you,  Mr.  President Unan.
Consent to look at the
fellow senator as I debate
him.
See, no objections.
Senator, thank you,  Mr.  President
Jerry. Uh, in
Judaism, there's a term
called a Mensch.
And uh I know Senator
Steinborn knows the term.
Um I'm not Jewish,
but my family have a
Judaism in my family
and you're a true mensch. Uh It
means you're beyond a
gentleman and
you really are. And I've always
cherished our relationship. You're one
of the most liberal members
in this chamber and I'm one of the most
conservatives and you've
always been a true gentleman to me.
Uh We've always shared a
passion for New Mexico
History, um
which I've always enjoyed. I
can't wait to read your book that we
talked about a couple of years ago that you're
writing. Um And I'm
sure our families are
intertwined that way.
Uh As we've talked about
and your love for Lobo. So
you and I are always talking about the
scores and it's just a
cherished, but mostly
you just again, I just want to emphasize you've
been a gentleman the entire
time. I've known you. It's
been a pleasure and I think that is
what the New Mexico Senate should
mean, uh, we're able to
work each other with each other
and God knows we've worked
together a lot. We worked against
each other a lot. But you've
always been a true gentleman
and you've always been willing to
put that last issue
aside. And how do we, how
do we come together? And
really, that's what the founders of this,
uh republic meant us to
do. Not always be at each other
and, and uh always fighting,
but actually working together. And I just
want to thank you, I've always
considered you one of the true
leaders of this chamber.
Uh and your personality
and your passion for New Mexico
is uh far from
over. And I, you,
you have become a dear friend of
mine and I appreciate
everything you've done for us and
for New Mexico, and I said
the same thing for Stewart earlier.
And it's, it's unusual
to have someone who's made a huge
positive impact on
the State of New Mexico.
And you are one such
gentleman, you have changed the state
for the better. So, thank you, my
friend.
Thank you, Senator Morris.
We have Senator Jaramillo, Senator
Hickey and Senator Lopez.
Next  Mr.
President. Not very many people know
this, but I serve with two
cousins in the Senate
and one of them happens to be Senator
Ortiz Y Pino, who's
my primo. And
so soon after I won my
election, he called me over.
We, we shared a
meal, we talked
about the Senate. We talked about
dreams of for moving
New Mexico forward
and what we thought New Mexico
needed in regards
to anything from Children
to seniors, to
those who are facing
trouble, even trying
to make ends meet.
And so Senator Ortiz Pino,
you have been a light in this
chamber, a man who
brings reason and a man
who speaks with conviction
and I'm gonna miss you.
The one major thing I'll never
forget which was captured in a
photo is after you
helped coach me on getting
my first bill through the senate
floor.
Like a proud primo as a
proud New Mexican. You
looked at me, you came over,
you gave me a fist bump and
that picture was captured.
I'll never forget that
moment that will live
with me forever. And
I'm hopeful that you're gonna move
to Dixon, New Mexico
because that makes you my
constituent where
you and I can have conversations
about how we can move Senate district
five forward because I know
although you will not be a sitting
senator, I can count on you
to continue to help me. And I'm
blessed to know you. Thank you,  Mr.
President. Thank you, Senator
Senator Hickey.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
And um
how do I say this?
Maybe, maybe
this is a good thing or not a good thing,
but quite honestly,
one of the reasons that
I'm here
is that
back when I was in
the uh
not for profit, profit
health care world. I
did work with Senator Ortiz
Pino on, on several
bills
and
I think working
with him watching
him through the
years,
I begin to say,
wow, that's how
you become somewhat effective.
That's how you take your
values and put
him to work and the
values that, that he has
brought to
the health care of the state.
His
incredible desire to
get everyone
getting health care. I don't want
to say insured. I mean, everyone
getting health care
is, is to me
an inspiration as well. But quite
honestly, as I look back
on all the reasons why I
decided to leave
that the
operating world and
and come into the political
world was he
was a role model and an
inspiration for me, much
like my mother who is a state
senator was an inspiration
for me. And I mean that in all
series, the
um and so thank you for
that. And now I have
to say he continues to be
an inspiration for me.
He's got a few
years on me and
sometimes I feel sorry for myself
because I'm pretty old, but I
look at him and say get over it,
dude. I mean,
you could be him.
So thank you for both
of those, Jerry and thank you for
all your mentorship during
these four years.
Really appreciate it. You
are an
institution in this state
in health care. And
so importantly, as
well, social work
and one day by God,
we will get lots of social
workers that'll be paid, but they ought to
be paid and they'll be doing the
jobs they should be doing
because of your inspiration.
Thank you, sir. Thank you,
Senator Hinkey, Senator
Lopez.
Thank you very much,  Mr.
President. And thank you Senator
Campos for bringing this
recognition
to, to the
floor.
UHS Tip
Pino Primo.
Um,
it has been an honour to work with
you over
the years, not just here in the
legislature, but in your other
um
roles that you've had in the
state, I have watched you have
learned from you and your
name came
with uh much
precedent when you entered
this chamber.
And I know  Mr.  President
that there was
a comment one time that I, I
heard you make
that if you'd known
um a little bit more about the
politics, you would have started
earlier in politics
arena.
It's just a long
when you made that,
that comment,
but your
influence, your
guidance, your
teaching for
many of us on this floor
in the other chamber also.
But I think for the public and all
the other advocates has
been phenomenal.
It's been wonderful
and
impactful.
You are leaving a
legacy
that whoever sits in that
chair of the
chair, person
of the Legislative
Health and Human Services Committee
is going to be some very
hard shoes to
fill
and the work that you've done
the legislation. The
knowledge that you bring.
I know that some of us still
have you on, on our phone.
I know that you still have
other endeavors um
to be engaged and
included.
And I just don't know
otherwise to say
thank you, Korra.
So Conor
uh a beque PAA
Dona
Trabaja Yamas.
Thank you. Thank
you, Senator Lopez. We have
Senator
Senator
Pirtle.
If not, I'll go to Senator
Brandt.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
And,
and when I started up here, I
was, I got to spend eight
years with
Jerry
and uh you know,
it started out a little
rough
and uh you know, Jerry's
the one that taught me, I need to learn
the rules.
I won't tell you why he
taught me that.
But uh
we uh you know,
we, we had some good
times and, you know, every
time things get a little
sporty
in public affairs, I'd start
doing the, you know, Jerry Springer
chant and go Jerry
Jerry. You
know, because there's occasion on
in spec that things got a little
crazy.
And uh I, I would
always think I was watching the Jerry
Springer show while I was in the
committee meeting sometimes
cause but
Jerry, you did a great job.
Um I learned a lot
from, you really
appreciate the respect
uh that uh you always
showed me
and I hope I showed the same
respect to you and I've
come to admire you. I
don't agree with a lot of your
positions but
we've always had some great
discussions
and uh I think we could
all learn a lot from that. We
could all be new our jobs
a whole lot better if
we would just sit down and talk to each
other. So,
and, and he always really had
great places for
committee dinners.
So, you know, the other
chairman could talk to him about
that because I
all, I never missed a committee
dinner uh for
Spack. So thank you Jerry.
I appreciate you.
And I'm
gonna give you a word of
advice.
Don't become a lobbyist.
Don't come up here.
Enjoy the rest of
your life with your family and
your grandkids.
Thank you Senator Brandt, Senator
Pirtle. Thank
you  Mr.  President and, and thank you
Senator Campos for, for this
certificate. And you know,
most of all, thank you Senator Ortiz
Pino for, for
everything. Butting
heads with me
having those nice coffees when
we would have coffee. But most
importantly,  Mr.  President, a lot of people don't
know this, but he had a bill one
time that would have
allowed people to shoot
drones out of the
sky
and, and I remember,
I remember disagreeing
with him about everything
and then all of a sudden, wait a minute, we
can shoot drones out of the sky for
sport.
And, and I thought me and Senator Ortiz
Pino just became best friends. We were
gonna go do karate in the garage like
it was gonna be a good time and,
and it was in that moment in this body
that I learned that even
when I disagree,
90% of the time,
95% of the time there
is a moment where we can come
together and agree on something.
You know, I had no idea would be shooting
drones for sport. But,
uh, I'll never forget, forget
that piece of legislation. But,
but in all honest, honesty
and, and truthfulness,
you know, just thank you for,
for always having
reason.
Um, not being afraid to call
out BS when you see
it or hear it such
as, you know, doing a role,
uh question the quorum and
then leaving the room
even got a chuckle out of me,
Mr.  President. And,
and so I just appreciate,
um, you know, what you've brought to the
body voice of reason at
times when it was needed.
Um, and just those times
when we could vote together
and, and those are the times that I'll cherish
the most, but just, just really
those cups of coffee
during the interim
whenever you would allow me to go steal
food from the committee
on those late nights under a
previous leader, uh,
when we'd get hungry around here
and just always being friendly.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Thank you, Senator Perel. And I remember
those drone bills. I think they were
part of the wild friends, right? Senator
Ortiz Aino.
We do have others uh who
would like to speak. We have Senator Woods,
followed by Senator Wirth
and Senator Stewart.
Thank you,  Mr.
President.
When I first came
in to the Senate,
I saw
Mister Senator
Ortiz Pino's name
and I walked over to him and
I said, you know, I, I leased
a ranch from a
man named
Ortiz Tino
and Galisteo
one time.
And he says, yeah, he
said that was one of
my uncles
or cousins or
anyway, uh,
I found out it was a very
long mini
minis,
decades or centuries. I
don't know how long
they have been in New Mexico,
but I, I do
remember um,
running cattle up there on
top of that mason
and having a lot
of fun and, and talking to
you about it and, and we
had a lot of time. Not, not many
people, no,
except Senator
Novell about
a whole day, Lavaca and,
and places like that. That's,
that's up there and, and
neat stuff, neat
stuff, old
cemeteries and goes
back well into
the early
18 hundreds and
just a lot of stuff up there
that kind of, we
got to see and
got to be around
and I always felt a kinship
to you, sir because of that
and, and
whenever I did get a
bill in your committee, you were
so, so kind
to me when you killed it,
it was just, it was
just, it may, it
warmed my
heart.
But uh we
always had a good time and
I thank you, sir. For being
here. Thank
you, Senator Woods, Senator
Wirth,
Senator
Stewart.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
It's,
it's kind of hard to find some
words to talk about you,
Jerry though. Words aren't
big enough for
you.
Uh, just
so honest and
so much integrity,
not afraid to speak
truth to power.
And that's hard to come
by your
work ethic.
My gosh, you run
that committee, like, as a
bulldozer. I
mean, you can just do
things that other people
can't. Your
attitudes are
just so wonderful.
Well, it was really fun for me
though. Iii I
had the same thing came
over from the house got stuck
in. Well, then it
was Spack
and, and if you haven't seen
Jerry mad.
Wow,
Senator Brandt saw him
get mad. I saw him get
mad. He, he got
so mad of what was going
on in the audience. He
just stood up and
yelled and they all ran away.
I mean, it, it was
very intense. So here's
this wonderful, sweet,
kind, compassionate
person who knows
how to speak up when he needs
to. So,
uh I think, you
know, we used to call J Paul the
conscience of this
house. Well, I think
you're the conscience of the
Senate.
So, uh we,
we shared this something
that I had forgotten a, a
little while ago that,
that I gave Jerry as first
check when he ran for
office
reminded me of two
other people. I gave their
first check to it didn't
work out as well as you. One was
Jacob Candelaria
gave him his first check,
shared a beer with him. It was
so long ago
and Senator
DDF,
so I used to try to
talk people to join
me up here in the theater
of the absurd. Uh
Just too much
fun to deny
you. So, thank
you, Jerry, just for who you
are for everything you've
done for being such a
role model for so many
of us. And I hope you
do have fun. I hope
to sometime follow
in your footsteps.
Thank you. Thank you,
Senator Wirth, Senator Stewart,
Senator Wirth, you're on the
list. I'll go on to the, would
you like to speak Senator Wirth?
Senator
Wirth?
Thank you, Mister President and
thank you Senator Campos and
thank you, Erry.
We came in together
at the same time and I still
remember very distinctly
being at some
advocacy group when
I had decided to run and
was being supported and,
and Senator Ortiz Pino was at
the same table and
I just along with Hector
Balderas. And I just
remember going, wow,
and kind of realizing
because he was a legende before he
got here, people knew
about Jerry. And then
what happened is similar for both of
us. We both ended up on the finance
committees. He was over here
on Senate Finance Committee
and I ended up over on the
House Appropriations and Finance
Committee for those first four
years.
And, you know, we had a lot of money,
uh but lots
of challenges on those committees.
And I just, uh remember
when I came to
uh the Senate,
uh, Jerry kind of
did a little switch,
uh and ended up in
public affairs, which was
the absolute perfect
place for him to be.
Uh I also, when I came to the
Senate that I wanted to be on the Senate
Finance Committee, but I didn't
have the seniority or the
connections. And so turned
out to be a really good thing for me
too because of course, all the money
disappeared in
2009 and it was a
really hard job for
everyone there. But
what you've always done,
Jerry is you've put the
policy before the
politics and
so you've managed to
navigate and
do this in a way
that really is a
role model for all of
us. And
chairing that interim
committee is
an immense
lift and you've
done it with grace, you
do it in a way that
those who appear,
feel welcomed
and able to have
input. And I just
think you have set a
precedent for all of us
to follow and we are
gonna miss you a
bunch. But as
Senator Lopez says,
you know, you're on our phones
and I don't be at all surprised
if we throw you a lifeline
for some help down the road,
but congratulations on it.
Just a tremendous run.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Thank you,
Senator. We, we have Senator
Rodriguez followed by Senator
mckenna and
Senator Siss, Senator
Shino and Senator
Hemphill.
Thank you,  Mr.
President. Um,
just, uh, I think reality has
set in Senator
Ortiz Pino. I've always
said since I heard a
few years ago that he was
going to retire.
I always said
actually many times you
recall, what are we going to do
without you, Jerry? I don't even want
to think about this,
but here it is, it's
setting in and time
is here and it's
real. And
so the
feeling of emptiness is
also real
and I can't
tell you how much
I have appreciated knowing
you and learning
from you. You know,
the, the deepness
within who you
are is what
I admire the most,
the true
substance that,
that you have in you
is unique
and it teaches us all
so much.
Um I
see you to be a
sensible
man,
truly, even in
the extreme
circumstances of
stress,
hard working to the
very max
and fearless
always
and yet you can
do all these things and still
be genuine
always to
someone we can always go
to count on
for anything we need.
You know, that almost
every time I have a bill,
I write on my little white sheet
of paper on the bill.
First Public Affairs,
I want to go to Jerry's
committee
because
because of who you are,
because of how
you care about the issues
because a lot of the issues that I
sponsor and, and work
on have to do with people
with disabilities or public
affairs in general.
And I know that I have a friend,
I know that I have a real
true, genuine friend
that deeply cares
that has nothing else in it
for him but the
motivation to serve
others, to love
others and to protect
the most vulnerable.
And there, I feel like I have
a deep friend in
you.
You, you bring semblance and
reason to the issues
always, even when we
disagree on certain
things or the committee
disagrees or whatever, you're,
you're always with that calmness
and semblance. I
will always miss
you.
Uh I have said, as I said
before that, you
know, you, when you
leave, it's gonna be empty
here. And now I,
all I can think of is
that. I'm glad you'll
be with us, at least through the interim.
Correct. You'll still be with us.
So I'll be seeing you in the interim
committees
and, um,
I look forward to that
and I, I wish you well, but
I know that we're gonna spend time
together this summer. So that
makes it a little easier to know that
we get to be with you at
least the summer
months. So, thank you
again,  Mr.  President. Thank
you, Senator Ortiz Pino.
Lots of love to you. Thank
you, Senator Rodriguez. So we have
several senators who still would like to
speak. Just a reminder.
Uh 630 is
a time frame that we've allotted. So I
just want to make sure that members
know that we have Senator
mckenna.
Thank you,  Mr.
President.
Thank you,
Senator Campos.
Thank you, Senator
Ortiz Y Pino.
Um
Mr.  President, I
got to know Senator
Ortiz Pino
um as
a citizen
lobbyist and a
volunteer.
And I have to say  Mr.
President and
Senator, I am so
thankful he was
so he's been so generous
to those of us who
invite
legislators to
talk to
us, for instance,
the the legal women
voters and
other environmental groups.
He always said yes.
And so I learned from
him really
fast and
I really appreciate everything he
shared with us.
Um And then when
I was elected,  Mr.
President,
um the senator was
one of the
chosen few that would help
us as
newbies get
used to what,
uh, what
the Senate
Public Health and Public
Affairs Committee
was all about. And
he gave us these really
special primers,
um, primers, I should
say to get us ready
for when we
took the oath and started
to serve our
constituents.
And  Mr.  President, I
really thank the senator
too
for
his, his
rich
institutional knowledge,
his willingness to
teach us
and knowing when to
rail this in,
in committee because some of us
are very excitable  Mr.
President. And when it comes
to human rights and
salaries and wildlife,
I get a little bit
excitable,  Mr.  President
and our chairman
always would keep us calm
and channel us.
And I know
even though he may turn in his
badge,  Mr.  President,
he's still an
incredible
person of institutional
knowledge and he'll keep sharing with
us. Thank you, Mister
President. Thank you, Senator
Ortiz Pino. Thank you, Senator
mckenna. We have Senator Griggs
followed by Senator Schmitty, Senator
Shino, Senator Hemphill,
Senator Tallman and Senator
Maestas.
Senator Griggs. Thank
you,  Mr.  President. Thank you,
Senator Campos and
Senator Ortiz Pino. I
mean, bless your
heart. 12 years
ago,
you had the
opportunity
in public affairs
to shepherd,
Senator
Brandt
me,
Senator Jacob
Candelaria
and Senator Daniel
Ivey Soto.
So,
you know, if that's kind of
not like, you know, trying
to herd chickens
or cats, I,
I don't know what else
is and you know, I
think as
the, as the years went
along, things things
got better. I mean,
I'm, I'm not sure with Senator Ivey
Soto, but things got
better regardless.
Um, and, and
Senator, I want you to know.
I've always, I've
always held you in, in
a high regard
and I've, I've done that because
you,
Senator Campos
embodied to me
the way a
senator should conduct
himself.
And
during the
discussion that
we had, uh,
several days back
with Senator
about Senator
Campos, I was, I was
texting with
you and I
told you that I held
you pretty much the
same, the same
way. And
you told me
in, in your own way,
you told me
know that
Pete was in
a level all by
himself and
while, uh, we
probably disagree about
that a little bit. I,
that's you,
Senator. That's, that's
you. That's the, that's
the way you operate. You're,
you're humble,
you're, you're
a genuine, a
genuine, good,
solid person
and the, the senate
has been fortunate
to have you in it.
And the example that you
set for all of
us will be
missed
because
that's
what you have brought to
the chamber.
You've done a lot of hard work. You've
done a lot of positive things
for the state. But that
example is
as important as any
of the other things you've done.
So,  Mr.  President
Senator Campos, Senator
Ortiz Pino, it's been a
joy to know you to get
to know you
better
have a great time
away from here.
And, uh, hopefully
we'll run across one another.
So, thank you,  Mr.  President. Thank
you, Senator Griggs.
Senator Schmid's,
thank you,  Mr.  President. Um,
just wanted to chime in. I've really,
really enjoyed, uh, working
with Senator Ortiz Pino
on sack.
Um, you know, a lot
of hours in that committee and I just,
uh, you know, um, I've
already said some positive things.
I think he knows that I hold him in
high regard.
Um, but really, you
know, he's, he,
he just really thinks through
problems. He's not
just a, you
know, reflexive party-line
voter. He, he really, really
thinks through issues. I have
such a respect for him,
especially in how
he's approached housing,
how he's approached child protective
services. CYFD.
So many of those issues
that he really has
his own way. It's not a
Republican or Democrat
way or any other
way. It's, it's his way
because he thoughtfully
considers those
issues. Um, and just
does, does his best
and everyone can see
that and,
uh, I really have respected how
he has run,
uh, the
committee
since I've been the ranking member for the
last four years
on that, on that committee.
And, um, you know, you just never
hear, you never hear, you know,
people being
gaveled down or
limiting debate or any drama.
There's just no, there, there, there's a lot
of very controversial
bills but, but
really not a lot of drama and it's
because, uh, the
chair does a great job,
uh, running
that uh that committee.
So thank you very much, Senator,
really an honour to have
worked with you. Thank you so much.
Thank you, Senator Smide
Senator
Campos.
Thank you very much,  Mr.  President,
members of the Senate. And I know that
there are still several
people that would like to go ahead and
speak on Senator
Ortiz Pino's behalf.
So, in closing, and there's so much
more to go ahead and say, but Senator
Ortiz Pino, just keep in
mind the
people here are your family.
We love you. These
remarks are not only
very sincere but
they're heartfelt.
So everything that we
have is
going to you this evening,
it's gonna be other contentious
pieces of legislation possibly
coming up later.
But you have set
the precedents for all of
us. You are
a cut above, you're
in a class, all your
own. You're an
individual who has
led the state
and I really hope that the media
and others pick this
up, take what
you have taught us.
So the next generation will
become so much better
and when they do,
I hope they always remember
the name of state.
Senator Gerald
Ortiz Iino.
Thank you very much,
Mr.  President. Thank
you, Senator Campos.
Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate,
please help me to recognize
Senator Ortiz Sub
Pino.
Thank you, Senator Disero. Thank
you, Senator
Campos.
Yes,
Mr.  President and,
and members of the Senate
brothers and
sisters of the Senate. Thank
you.
Um,
I, I especially
was touched by, by
Senator Stewart talking about
my anger because
people say, oh, Jerry is so
nice and he runs such
a calm
committee. But I
think Senator
o'neill is not here tonight, but he was in
the room the day.
I just about broke a gavel
in half, gaveling
an obstreperous
crowd. I
think you were there. Craig. It,
it was, it,
it, it, I have a lot
of anger. I've always had a lot of
anger that, that, that's
why I've been fired from five
jobs over my
lifetime
and I just figured I better
retire before
I get fired from another one.
So, um,
um, but
it, but I
think it comes out because I
care so much about certain
things and
over time and from you
all, I've
learned so
much, I mean, every single
member of this body I've learned,
I, as you set up to speak, I could
think of things that I've learned
from you and,
and, and then when, when Stewart
was here today thinking of things that
I learned from him
every day. I learned
something in our committee.
I love Sack. I, I
love Rules too
because in rules, you get
to know everything about state
government. These, these, these
secretaries come up for
confirmation of these obscure
little commissions come up
for. God only knows
what they do. And, and
you're, you're always learning
something new and that's
what I loved about the Senate that
we could always be,
be, we'd
finish one year at the all discourage,
we didn't get things done that
we wanted to get done.
But we have the interim and we have
next year and you can just
keep on learning and keep on
doing more things.
So I, I do
think it's time. I, I love
that Senator Padilla
thinks I have several decades
of life. I
had to, to keep on
working. II, I am
in my eighties. I,
I don't think I do have
decades. I, I know I've
stopped buying the old vaudeville
joke. I've stopped buying green
bananas. Um,
but I,
but, but I
do,
I do think it is time
to leave because I, I have other
things that I want to do and
that I have put off
because the work in the
Senate is so demanding. So
20 is enough. That's a nice
round number.
Um II,
I,
I know that there are other members who will
work a lot longer than 20
they've got, you know,
great things ahead of them,
but 20 is enough for
me. Uh I will
finish the year out and I'm looking
forward to the interim and getting things
geared up for whatever you
all can accomplish next year.
We, we can work with the
committees that way.
But I just want to say from the bottom
of my heart that this is family
for me. Um
II, I remember when
every one of you except
Senator Lopez, Senator
Campos and Senator
Scherer and Senator
Rodriguez came into the body.
I was already here when all the
rest of you came in and,
and, and I learned so much
from them and now the
chance to learn from you all has been
great. Thank
you. Uh II,
I certainly
don't think I deserve
this, these
accolades, but I'm deeply
grateful for them.
And I want to thank you
to, uh,  Mr.  President
for the times we've been able
to work together and in the
years we've had working together.
Thank you all so much.
Thank you, Senator
Dein
Senate majority floor leader Peter.
We to take us to the next order of business.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Yield the
first to Senator Gonzalez and then
Senator Munoz. And then I'll give a
little roadmap of what we're going to do
tonight. Thank you, Senator
Gonzalez. Thank you,  Mr.
President. I would like to make
a request that we might be able
to remove our coats,
hearing no objections. You may remove
your coats. Thank you, Senator Gonzalez.
Senator, thank you, Senator Munoz.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. I didn't get to
speak but you know Jerry, I just
want to tell you, thank you for everything
you've done. He's over there
hugging. We spent a little time
in, in across
the ocean and, and had a good
time with him and his wife.
Enjoy your retirement,
enjoy your family, do
the things you didn't want to do
and we'll miss you here. So that's my
quick with that,  Mr.
President. I ask
you that consent that the Senate
finance referral to Senate bill
96
be dropped
removed. Thank you, Senator
Munoz. If you give us the title of that
bill, uh,
increasing,
uh, attempted murder
penalties,
there has been a request for unanimous
consent,
seeing no objection
so ordered
Senator Michael
Paia.
Thank you very much, Mister
President Yan's
consent to excuse Senators
Stefani Sedillo
Lopez Cervantes
hamblin
o'neill and
Duhigg and somehow Gallegos wound
up on my chart here,
but I'm sure the minority whip
would want to excuse him. So
that's Stefanik, Sadio Lopez
Cervantes Hamlin o'neill
and Duhigg until they return
to the chamber except for the purposes of a
call. And I have one other thing,  Mr.  President.
Thank you, Senator
Senator Padilla  Mr.  President
Point of Order, Senator Pter,
for which purpose do you r? Thank
you,  Mr.  President. I think that's because they're
all members of conservation.
But uh Mason's
is pretty clear on
committee's meeting while we're on the
floor. It's
section 628. If we wanted
to look at that, it's
uh committees except conference committees
may not meet during the sessions of the
house without the consent of the
house to secure
consent. The chair of the committee should
present a motion requesting
the consent.
So I, I believe that's the proper
motion as opposed to
excusing each one
individually. Um
That's, that's the motion that should be
put before the body. Thank
you, Senator Pirtle, Senator Wirth.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Uh
We went through this a little earlier
earlier in Mason's, there's
a section that talks about
precedent and
in the last days of the session,
this chamber has always
allowed finance
and different committees to jump up
and do bills. And so
again, I, I appreciate what you're
flagging and we'll make sure that
happens moving
forward. But I do think,
you know, the precedent is
what we go to first before
Masons and
again, happy to
make sure if we do this in the, in
the final what 40
hours that we work on
that?
And  Mr.  President, the motion would just
be amended. I think it
would solve
itself just to,
to
move that
conservation committee be allowed to
meet during this floor session,
I think would, would
suffice and fix the
rule.
Thank you, Senator Pirtle and
Mr.  President. I, I don't have a problem with
making that motion. I think that's
fine. And so I would,
I would move that the Senate Conservation
Committee be allowed to
step upstairs for just a few
moments and they'll, they'll be
coming back
and would make that motion. Thank
you. There's been a motion for
unanimous
consent.
All those in favour signified
by saying I
those opposed nay
the I's have it.
Thank you, Senator Pirtle, Senator
Padilla.
Thank you very much, Mister President.
Just wanted to announce another time
for the body that
ecumenical ashes will be
distributed tomorrow morning at 7:30
a.m. in this building by
Archbishop Wester.
Thank you. Thank you,
Senator Padilla, Senator Wirth. Thank
you, Mister President in consent.
Actually, before we do the table work, let me
just let everyone know what we're going to do.
So we have a heads up. We're going
to do one item from the calendar this
morning. Item number eight.
That will be Senator Mu
House Bill 177.
And then we are going to go to the supplemental
calendar, the
pink supplemental calendar.
And we're going to do the items in this
order. We had to, there's a
little jump because you've got to list
the Senate bills first. But just to
give everyone a six
bills item
number one, Senator Nibert,
that will be one item
number two, Senator Maestas.
That will be two. We'll
then jump to item number
four. That will be Senator
Stewart
and then we'll jump back
up to
item number three on this
calendar, which will be
Senator Ivey Soto. That will be
the fourth item we do tonight
and then we'll do five and six in
the order that are shown
on the calendar
and I'll get you sponsors
for the five and six as
we move through the evening.
Uh, so  Mr.  President Inam
consent, we go to that our business messages
from the house. Thank you, Senator
Wirth. I just wanted to a point a clarification
that you had mentioned. Item
number eight would be Senator Munoz.
I believe that that item number
nine on the blue calendar
that would be sent  Mr.  President.
That's absolutely correct. It
is. It
is.
No, I believe it's number eight.
Yeah, I believe we haven't done number
eight. We didn't
know.
Uh Yes, we, we
did.
We haven't done number nine. I
think it's number nine that we're going to
do. It's going to be
number nine. My apologies
on that. It will be Senator.
Number nine, we'll start with House
Appropriations and Finance Committee. Substitute
for House Bill 196

them, um move them forward
and see if they are making a
move in New Mexico.
It's a way to track and
watch money that it's
working correctly.
And so that's kind of what it
started in the regional form
currently in the form you have on your
desk, this creates the,
uh this creates the
fund. It
makes a program
transfer and
then it requests
LFLFC
and D fa to, to review
the government accountability
uh fund. And then
when our reserve bucket
gets full,
it's gonna flow into this
fund. So once we hit,
we're at 30 billion in reserves.
That's a target number. If we get
an additional 100 million over what we
currently think we're gonna have,
we're gonna flow that 100 million
into this governmental
accountability trust fund.
Uh It is counted as
part of our reserves.
So as we have 512
million in there right now,
that's 5% reserve.
So 25% in
cash, 20 of the
other 512 million
in cash in this one. And with
that,  Mr.  President, I'll stand for
questions.
Thank you, Senator Munoz Senators.
We're debating House Appropriations and
finance Committee, substitute for House
Bill 1196.
Anyone wishing to debate Senator
Shino?
Uh Thank you,  Mr.  President. Will he
sponsor you?
And when you to yield,
Mr.  president uh to the
good flying Shindo. I do.
All right. Thank you,  Mr.  President. Uh
Can, can you explain a little
bit more? I, I was
it this bill? I didn't
hear in our, our committee.
So what is the purpose
of this? Fun?
And I think, didn't Nancy Pelosi
say just vote for it and we'll find out
what's in it
later.
No,  Mr.  President
Center, this is probably
one of the mechanisms
is how you change budgeting
across the board.
We take a pot of money,
$1 billion where we
started, we
appropriate it to different
agencies. CYFD is
one of these agencies that's
appropriated and then you
watch, we did it in Child
Protective Services for
Cyfd. We
did a few other things and
off the top of my head, I can't remember
but we're tracking. So
we're tracking or if they
pull $10 million
out of Child Protective
Services, how many
people got served
where they got served? What
was the outcome and where,
what was the result?
And so this is creating
that fund to
start tracking government as
we spend
included in. This
is language that
we have to update the Government
Accountability Fund,
Government Accountability
Act. And so
as we move forward in a generation,
you heard Senator, the good
senator from the
Albuquerque in the West side with
his two boys talk about
the reporting in volume
two
and how we should start
looking to change. That does it
really serve us in a
good way. And so that's
the other part of this,
but the good part about this
is we'll have
accountability as we spend
money into the future and we'll
know exactly where it's being
spent and how it's being
targeted. Uh
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
So, so, so are
these programs or projects
uh  Mr.  President
that the departments already
have that will be
funded or is this an opportunity
to pilot new
initiatives within the
department? Uh  Mr.
President
Mr.  President, that's exactly
right. This is to demonstrate
pilot projects and how they can
be successful or how they
cannot be successful.
We'll be able to look at
them that funding is in
House Bill Two, your
grow money which was
attached to this and now in House
Bill Two is coming out of this fund
so we can track and say,
ok, Senator Munoz, you
gave money to
the Veterans Services Department
for behavioural health
issues and suicide.
Ok. How many people did they serve
with the amount of money you had?
How many, how many uh
client
contacts that they had in
veteran services? It's a
tracking form. It's a
funding mechanism with a pilot
with a tracking form.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. I
appreciate that. I, I think, you
know, probably a good way for
us to have results before we
pour, you know, a lot of dollars
into projects and, and really
don't have any answers for some of
the issues that we're trying to solve. Thank you,
Mr.  President and I can give
me a better answer than Nancy Pelosi.
Thank you, Senator Munoz. We do have
further debate. We have Senator
Pope.
Thank you  Mr.  President.
And uh this is the
first time seeing this as well.
Uh Not being on finance,
you mentioned a little bit about
this fund setting up is going
to fund the grow fund.
And so one of my
questions is did setting
up this fund impact
uh the current budget
in HB
two
Senator Munoz mister
President, this
did not really affect, but there's
contingency spending. Your
grow money is in House Bill
two contingent on
this trust fund getting up and
transferring and making that
money move. It
did not affect House
Bill two because when we
built this, this budget
early on in
November, December,
this was part of the strategy
from LFC coming
out.
Thank you,  Mr.  President and
thank you, Senator. So
going forward, will this
fund really be the
mechanism
for maybe further
appropriations or to
increase funding in state
programs?
Um  Mr.  President
Senator, yes.
As a as I just
said, you know, I'm gonna use
my money for an example
for the Department of Veterans
and say they're gonna just take
my money and use it for suicide
prevention. How many
calls did they get? How many
veterans do they service?
What's it look like you could have gave
your money for a reading
literacy program like the governor
wanted and we could have put it
in here and said, how many
kids got some
reading literacy in that
program and what were their
scores before and after?
And how much did it cost us? And
how much did it cost us for each
individual kid in boot camp?
That's, that's the premise
of this is, is not
just throw money at pe D
because we have four point
some billion inside pe
D. And we don't know if we get
results or not.
Senator Pope. Thank you,
Mr.  President. Thank you, Senator.
So um one
final question um
where I guess
where would we be able to track
what the metrics are, the
performance analysis on these
programs? Do we
have any involvement in that
or um who is kind
of developing
that Senator Munoz
Mr.  President over the
summer and once house
bill to get signed and adopted
D fa and, and local
governments or not local governments,
but the uh
cogs will
start funnelling that money
out if
I, I'll give you another
example of mine, I gave money
for domestic violence in
grants. So
the cog in
Northwest New Mexico will
transfer that money.
The behaviour of the
Domestic Violence Shelter will
say I serviced
42 women and 82
kids and,
and then we'll say, OK,
that, that money is
being put to use and it's
good. I can give you a bad
example. I heard
one out of junior last
year where it was for
a trail and then they tried to
move it for a Christmas
party. I'll give
you another example in
Southeast New Mexico
where we gave junior money and
it turned out for a
golf
lessons.
And so we got
to get some tracking and
accountability in, in
government.
Senator Pope. Thank you,  Mr.
President. Thank you,
Senator.
Any further debate, senators,
we have further debate. We have Senator
Brantley. Thank you,
Mr.  President. I want to recognize
that on the analysis, we have this turned
into quite a partisan
bill and I on the
house side and I really can't
understand why I
know there's gonna be consequences either way
for our votes here tonight.
But there's, there's
accusations of what's happening
here is it's tricky budgeting
that we're taking what should
be recurring revenues
and putting it into one
time for two years in a row,
one time money and that we're
doing that so that the bill
that the total budget looks
like we're not inflating
it as much. And, and I
completely, although that is
true, I would
argue that it's actual
responsible budgeting
because instead of making
permanent recurring
revenue additions to
the budget, it's on a
trial period. And so
the way I look at this bill is
that for two years,
it's like a vetting process
of one time money to
see if it should be
incorporated into the budget for
full time recurring
revenues. It's, it's a step
in the right direction in
cleaning out programs
that we're not seeing outcomes
on. And so my perspective
is completely different than
some of the analysis that's been provided
to us tonight. In my opinion,
this is responsible budgeting.
This is how we clean up
a budget where we're not
seeing turns on
those investments. And so I, I
wholeheartedly
support,
you know, this bill and what it's
intended to do and I hope that we
actually expand
accountability measures like
this in all sorts of
budgeting processes as we
move on. So I'm happy to stand
and support. Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Thank you, Senator Brantley. Any further
debate? We have further debate. We have
Senator Lopez.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Will the
sponsor yield
Mister President? I will
and  Mr.
President,
I understand that there are
some things that were not
allocated by us as grow
funds, but some, some
programs that found
themselves in, in the grow
fund category.
Is that correct
Senator Munoz?
Mr.  President? Senator? Yes,
that's correct. That is an
agency request that you'll
see in there and some of that may be
the
governors.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Does that mean that those
programs will get the
scrutiny of a grow fund,
the same scrutiny that other grow
funds get
Mr.  President, Senator. Yes,
thank you,  Mr.  President. That's
helpful to learn. Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Cilia Lopez. Any
further debate,
senators
seeing no further further
debate,
Senator Munoz to close on the
bill. Thank you,  Mr.
President. This is no
different. I mean, this is
not fancy
government
raise the, raise the
rates. This is
we live in the 21st
century. If you're
not gonna test
new ideas and move
beyond the
18th century, the
19th century. In
budgeting, we're
not gonna get where we need to be
in New Mexico.
If you don't have a vision
and attempt the vision
and try to fix the problems
with the amount of money that we
have and just throw
it away and say we
put it there and
it's gonna go away in a deep dark
hole. Um, you know,
the good senator next to me, if
he was gonna go buy a new
vehicle, he'd want to demo
it. If he was gonna buy
a used vehicle, he'd go kick the
tires and drive it around
the block and put some miles on it
and make sure it's worth buying.
It's the same model that we
use in our everyday life.
We just want to do it for
government. They have
to be accountable for tax
dollars, especially
when it comes to Cyfd
and the problems that we've been having in
Cyfd. I mean,
we paid out nearly $20
million in, in lawsuits,
but the accountability portion
is what's gonna make this work for
government with that  Mr.
President, I move that
House Appropriations
and Finance Committee for House Bill
196. Do now pass and, and
ask Nance consent in the Senate.
Let the record show that the rule has been
called and all those

football
if you wish to vote. No, please

affirmative zero in the negative. House
Appropriations and Finance Committee
substitute for House Bill
196 has
passed the Senate Senator Munoz.

New Mexico should start
looking forward and,
and
you know, thank you

joined a forward
thinking group now. Thank you.

Peter. Thank you,
Mr.  President. So the final
items for tonight are on the supplemental
calendar. I just want to go back
through that again and I do have the sponsors
on the last two items.
We do item number one,
Senate Bill 231st,
Senator Nibert, uh
item number two Senate
Bill 96. That
will be Senator Maestas.
Then we'll jump to item
number four on the calendar.
We'll do that third. That will be Senator

we will go back to item number

Soto is going to do that
item number five. We'll do
fifth. That'll be Senator
J House Bill 151
and we'll close it out with
Senator Pirtle on
item number
six.
Thank you, Senator
Senator Wor
Pernel
with that  Mr.  President Unanimous
and we go to that our business third reading of
legislation. I yield to
Senator Nibert for item number
one Senate Bill
230.
Mr.
President
Mr.  President, I ask unanimous
consent of the Senate that the
rules be suspended
and that the records show that all
actions for placing
Senate Bill 230
as amended,
be placed on final
passage has been taken
and that is now subject to
debate, amendment or
substitution. No
objection,
Senator Nibert, if you'll explain
the
bill,
Mr.  President, uh this
bill allows the
aggregation of
health data to be
utilized in research
purposes and
we do have one slight
amendment uh to address
a concern that was brought up in
committee by Senator Sadilla
Lopez. So at this
time, uh  Mr.  President,
I would move uh
amendment floor
Senate floor amendment number one
to Senate Bill 230
as
amended.
Thank you. Thank
you, Senator I, as we're debating
house Senate bill 230
is amended. Senator
Pad.
Thank you mister President
Unan consent to
excuse
senators Duhigg
Cervantes
and o'neill
until they return to the chamber
except for the purposes of a
call.
Seeing no
objection,
Senator
Padilla.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Thank
you,  Mr.  President. We do
have a, we do
have a floor amendment to read or
read
Senate floor amendment number
one to Senate Bill 230 as
amended amendment sponsored
by Senator Greg
Nibert.
Senator Nibert
to move and explain
the amendment.
Uh  Mr.  President,
I do move Senate
floor amendment number one to
Senate Bill 230 as
amended. And
if you wish me to explain
the amendment, I'll be happy to do
so. Thank you,
Senator for moving
that. Go ahead and explain what
your amendment attempts to
do.
An issue was brought up
that. Uh well,
the University of New Mexico
has protocols in
place to make
sure that the
data is properly
uh evaluated
and that the confidentiality
maintained. Uh There
was some concern that other
institutions may not be
subject to
that same protocols.
And so this amendment
brings those other
institutions specifically
uh in line with federal
regulations that concern
that issue. So we believe
that that covers the
concerns that were expressed in
committee. Thank you,
Senator Ver Senators. We're debating
Senate floor amendment number
one,
send us to the
lovers.
Um Thank you,
Mr.  President. Looking
at the amendment. I believe that it
does address my
concern, which was
um if other
research institutions
were to use that data,
there was no guarantee that the,
the same, the same treatment
that UN M does to
its for its research
projects would be
um would
be provided and by
referring to the
institutional review boards
and the federal relations that
govern them. I feel
comfortable that that would not happen
with other research projects. So,
thank you um
sponsor, I think they've sponsor of the
bill for making this amendment. Thank
you. Thank you, Senator C Lopez.
Any further debate?
We are on Senate floor amendment. Number
one,
seeing no debate on the
amendment. Senator
Nibert to close.
It's a good amendment.
Thank you, Senator
Nibert.
Do I need to make the motion
again,
Mr.  President, I move that
Senate floor amendment number
one to Senate bill
number 230. As
amended, do now
pass
and ask for a voice
vote. Thank you. Senator
Neibert Senators has
been a
request for a voice vote to
adopt Senate floor amendment. Number one,
all those in favour signify by
saying I those
opposed nay the I's
have it. The amendment
has passed the Senate. We are back
on the bill.
Senators, we are back on the bill. Senate
Bill 230 is a mandate. I yield to
Senator Morris. Thank you,  Mr.  President. I
know it's late in session but
Senator  Mr.  President
with the Senator yield,
Senator Nibert Yield,
Mr.  President, I do yield
Senator Morris  Mr.
President. Senator. Is
this your first bill to the
Senate floor,
Mr.  President? That, that
would not be the
case. I think I've had several
bills that have gone through
this body and pass a point
of order.  Mr.  President
your first bill as a senator
to the floor.  Mr.
President and
Senator Moos. This
is my first bill
as a senator.
Senator Moos,
let the party
begin.
I do hear applause but
the bill hasn't been passed
yet.
We are debating Senate bill
230 is two times
amended. Anyone
wishing to debate
Senator Steinborn?
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Senator. Will you yield for a question?
Senator Nibert, do you yield  Mr.
President? I do yield.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Senator. What is the word
count of your, of your
amendment?
Mr.  President
and Senator? I do not
know the word count.
Senator Steinborn. Just
for clarification. We are on the bill,
not on the amendment. Well,
that's what I meant,  Mr.
President, but,
but that does give me some pause
about the gentleman's
awareness and knowledge of
his bill. And,
uh, do you know what the letter count is?  Mr.
President? Senator
Senator  Mr.
President? I do not know the
letter counts.
Dang  Mr.  President.
It's really important to be prepared.
So I don't know. I'm gonna have to listen
to debate  Mr.  President.
I have my doubt too. Thank
you, Senator Steinborn. Any further
debate
seen Senator
Pirtle?
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Will the sponsor
please yield Senator D
yield
mister President. I will
yield Senator Pirtle.
And thank you, Mister President.
When does this
law, this change
take effect?
Senator
Nibert
July 1
or  Mr.  President July
1 2024
Senator Pirtle. And thank you
Mr.  President. And, and why did
we not put an
emergency clause?
Senator Nibert,
um  Mr.  President.
Uh I think
we overuse emergency
clauses when there's not
emergencies. And so
this going into
effect will cover
even the time period
before July
1 2024. So
there's no emergency that
exists. Thank you, Senator
Nibert, Senator Pirtle and
thank you  Mr.  President for
that. I see. We reference
14-6 dash
one. What
is that
section of law dealing
with Senator
Niver?  Mr.  President?
Could the Senator point
me to a page and
line, it's
page
four
line 24.
It says subject to the
provisions of section
14-6 dash
one N MS A
1978.
Thank you, Senator Pirtle, Senator
Nibert. Well,
Mr.  President, I could pull the
statute and look or I
could have my
expert witness come
in if the Senate will
give unanimous consent to
allow  Mr.  Jason
weeks my expert to
come in
objection.
There's been several objections.
You're on your own. Senator.
Well,
Mr.  President, if you give
me one moment to step over
here, I will pull it
and  Mr.  President, if we wanted to
just
ask the majority floor leader
to uh, maybe go on to the next
item and, and we could come
back, I think
would probably be
acceptable.
Senator Wirth
mister President. Is that a
motion?
Thank you,  Mr.  President. I try to keep a
motion out of, out
of the off the senate
floor.
Senator Iber. Would you like to
request an expert
witness? Uh No,
sir, I have the
statute
Senator Hebert. You, you're welcome
to request an
expert witness.
Well, Mi  Mr.  President,
I no longer need a witness. I,
I have the statute book
in front of me. I'm 14-6
dash one is
health information,
confidentiality,
immunity from liability
for furnishing
and I presume
data. Thank
you, Senator Senator Ple, you have the
floor and, and thank you,
Mr.  President. Now, I'm curious, how
long have those books been back there? Because
I've been here 12 years. I didn't even know they
were there. So  Mr.
President, the, the freshman
senator has has taught me
something. And so like Senator
Ortiz Pino said earlier,
uh, no long, no matter how long you've
been here, you can learn something. II,
I knew the books were up front but
I didn't know Cervantes had his own
collection back there to, to
peek through. Thank you,
Senator Pertile. We do have
further debate.
We have Senator IVIS Sota.
Thank you very much,  Mr.  President,
Mr.  President. Well, the sponsor
of the bill yield, Senator
Ibert Deald. Uh
Mr.  President, I will
yield to the gentleman
who's probably gonna grow me
harder. Senator
Arioto. Thank
you very much,  Mr.  President
Mr.  President. I'm looking
at uh section
32 A six A
24
subsection
D in the bill
and I noticed
that that you strike
through there, uh the
legal custodian,
you, you have authorization from
the, from the child
and you say, or legal
custodian for a child
less than 14 years
of age, you strike for a child,
less than 14 years of age. And
I, I'm, I'm actually quite curious
why it is that you did that
because you
don't
uh
you don't do that.
Uh
up above
uh there's a distinction about when
a child is under the under the age of
14, that the child's
legal custodian is, is authorized
to consent and
that when a child is 14 years
of age or older with capacity
to consent that they have
the authority to consent. So, why does it,
why why do you strike
there for a child less
than 14 years of age?
Thank you, Senator Vito, Senator
Ibert.  Mr.
President. I believe that
we
are
providing exceptions
here for that
so that we do not
need uh the
consent to aggregate
this data.
So the age
of the minor
would not be at
issue,
Senator
Aviso. So
Mr.  President, Senator Nibert,
so you're simply taking health
information
about a child without
the authority of
either the child or the legal
custodian of the child. Is that the case?
Thank you, Senator Senator
Nibert.  Mr.  President
and Senator, that would be
the overall effect
of both
statutes that we
are amending here so that the
data can be collected
and use for research
purposes without
checking with
the patient or
the person
from whom
the data is uh
relevant. And
there are protocols in place
to make sure that that data
cannot be attributed
to any one
individual
Senator Aviso and  Mr.
President, Senator Niver, would you
point out where in the bill? It says
that the information is going to
be deon is gonna
be
anonymized.
Uh  Mr.  President
and, and Senator that would
be in the
institutional review
board in compliance
with the federal HIPAA
laws as well as
uh the amendment
that requires federal
regulations governing
institutional review boards.
Those are the areas
that uh uh
disallow
the attribution of
data to any one
individual
Senator Aviso.
So  Mr.  President, Senator Ebert, you are
specific about taking
information without,
without uh about
Children without authority
to do so
from the child or the
child's parent. But you're not
specific about the fact that we're
going to anonymize
that information is that the case,
Senator
Nibert
Mr.  President, I'm not sure I
quite captured
what his question was,
but the
bill is to
take all data
from variety
of patients to be able
to use that for research
purposes and
to ensure that the
data
that is secured
is not attributable
to any one
patient.
Thank you. Thank you,
Senator Senator Ives Soto.
Thank you very much,  Mr.  President,
uh uh the sponsor of the bill. Have you
ever been the subject of a
research, uh a medical
research project?
Uh  Mr.  President
and Senator,
yes,
Senator Iota
and uh  Mr.  President, uh
Senator Ibert, would you care
to uh express to the body
what the, what the nature of the
research was and, and how it
might have affected you point of
order? Um
Mr.  President
Covid,
thank you, Senator Neibert,
Senator Sms. For which
point do you rise?
Um  Mr.
President, our rules
do not permit
personal questions during
debate. Good point,
Senator Sms. You've
been overruled, Senator IVIS
Oto
Mr.  President. I was
merely wondering what
the policy implications were
not the, not the personal nature of
it was, but the policy implications of
his presence on the
Senate floor. Given,
given his having been the
subject of, of
medical testing
in the past that
might impact
the new senator's
presence on this
floor and
something that we might all want to be
aware of. Thank you,
Senator veto.
But apparently we, we're
not allowed to know such things, even
though, even though according to this
bill, we're allowed
to know such things about Children
without, without their parents' permission,
but we can't know them on
the senate floor about fellow fellow senators,
but that's, that's fine. Thank you very
much,  Mr.  President.
Thank you, Senator Viso.
Seeing no further debate,
Senator Nibert to
close
Mr.  President. Uh the
statement that the Senator made
at the last moment was
inaccurate.  Mr.
President
Mr.  President. I have my hand up,
I apologize. Senators
Shindo,
Senator Shino to debate
with the  Mr.  President with the
sponsor you,
Senator
Mr.  President. I do
yield Senator
Shino.
How does this play out if
the child is an Indian
child?
Senator Ibert,
uh  Mr.
President,
this does not
look at any particular
child, it looks
at Children
who may be at the University
of New Mexico Hospital
and the collection of data
regarding certain health
concerns and then
the utilization of that
data to
conduct research
based upon the
data that's
collected.
Thank you, Senator
Nibert  Mr.  President. The
amendment that would just
adopted
by this
body and any
federal regulations governing
institutional review
boards. Are you
aware of any tribes
that have institutional review
boards? Thank you, Senator
Sino, Senator Ibert.
I am not  Mr.  President.
I am not aware of
any uh review
boards on any
tribal uh
entities. I
would suspect that there
are federal
federal regulations
that deal with the use of this
data across the
board, which would apply
to Indian and
Nonn institutions.
Uh  Mr.  President, the Navajo
Nation does have their own
internal review board.
Uh And, and
so I know that, you know,
with IWA the
Indian Child Welfare Act with,
when it relates to, you know,
CYFD,
and there's certain
uh protocols
that are taken by
CYFD
and, and, and I'm just
looking at this and try
to, this did not
come in front of my committee. So I'm trying to
figure out, you know
whether this
uh amendment
that we adopted
because it's a federal
regulations governing institutional review
boards and these are tribal review
boards,  Mr.  President.
So, thank
you, Senator Shino, Senator
Nibert, um  Mr.
President and, and Senator
Shino. I don't believe
that a
tribal review board
would have
jurisdiction over data
collected at UN
M hospital
or at a
hospital that is located
outside of uh
tribal
jurisdiction.
Thank you, Senator Senator
Shino. Uh  Mr.
President uh II, I
can understand how uh
your argument
but this child, you know,
if it's a tribal
member and the tribal
uh has a governor review
board or,
or? OK, let me the other question. Are
these data, aggregate
data, not
individual data? Thank
you, Senator Shindo, Senator Nber.
Uh  Mr.  President
and Senator Shindo. The
answer is Yes.
OK. All right.
So, uh, I'm
gonna, uh, I guess
there's no more debate. I'm the last
one, but I, I
will,
uh
look at this. I know it's a lot of
information to look at, but
for the moment, uh,
that's it for now,  Mr.  President.
Thank you, Senator Sindo. Any
further debate,
senators
see no further
debate,
Senator Nibert to close.
Thank you. Thank you,  Mr.
President.
This uh, data
that's being requested to
be reviewed is important
for research at
UN M and and other
health institutions because
it's through that data
that they can determine
whether or not
there are,
there's some connection
between
particular
item that's being
addressed and
maybe potential causes
down the road. So it's very
important for UN M
and other institutions to
have this uh
ability to look at the data.
And so I encourage
my colleagues to vote in
favour of this.
So at this time,
I move
that
Senate bill 230
as twice amended
uh do now
pass.
And  Mr.  President,
uh I ask
unanimous consent of
the Senate that the records show
that the role has been called and all
those present

by a vote of
21 in the affirmative
17 in the negative. Senator
Ibert, you have just passed your first Senate
bill and senate bill 230
is twice amended. Congratulations.
We do have some who want to explain
their vote. We got Senator Purtle and
Senator Bill to explain their
vote.  Mr.
President, uh, having voted.
No, I'd like to change my vote to.
Yes,
Mr.
President
Senator Pertell.
Mr.  President, having
voted in the majority, I move
the Senate reconsider senate
bill 230 as twice
amended. Thank you, Senator
Pertile. You're almost there,
Senator Niver
seeing no
objection,
all those in favour.
So you unified by saying
I don't
oppose nay
if you wish to vote. No, we
are on the bill if you wish to vote.
No, he's
got a start up.
Mr.  President Senator Neer,
they're going to put you through this whole thing all
over again. I apologize,
Mr.  President, Senator
Senator, as
we are done with
the previous vote, unanimous
consent to excuse Senator
Corea Hemphill until she returns
to the chamber except for the purposes of a call
hearing no objection.
Sarah Nber. If you'll take us through
that script. Once
again,
Mr.
President,
I move that Senate
bill 230
as twice amended
do now pass and I
ask unanimous consent
of the Senate that the records
show that the roll has been
called and
that all those present
voted in the affirmative
except for
those
in the negative by a show
of hands. Thank you, Senator
Ibert Senators.
We are voting on Senate bill 230
is twice amended if you wish to
vote. No,
please raise your hand.
Senator Brandt leave
now,
Senator Mooresville, you
know,
on your
level
by a vote of 38 in the
affirmative zero on the negative Senate bill
230 is twice amended
has passed the Senate. Senator
Nobert Nibert. Thank you for being such a
good sport. Congratulations
on your first bill. Big round of applause.
You  Mr.
President,
did you, did you
take it? Thank
you.
Thank you. We're gonna continue on
the calendar and I'll yield to
Senator Maestas for
item number two. That's gonna be Center Bill
96 Senator
Maestas.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. This is
regarding Senate Bill
96 I ask unanimous
consent of the Senate that the records show
that all action for placing
Senate Bill 96
on final passage has been
taken and that is now
subject to debate, amendment
or substitution. No
objection, Senator Maas,
we'll explain the bill.
Thank you,  Mr.  President Senate
Bill 96 deals with our
homicide statute
and it gets our maximum
penalty for second degree murder
more in line with surrounding
states and consistent
with principles of criminal
justice reform.
It increases the maximum
penalty from 15
years to 18
years also
increases the potential
penalty for attempted secondary
murder from three years
to nine. With that I
stand for questions. Thank you, Senator
May so Senator, as we're debating Senate
Bill, 96
anyone wishing to
debate?
See no debate,
Senator Maestas to close on the bill.
Thank you  Mr.
President. And I just want
to invoke the beautiful
memories of my cousins Christina
Harr, Margaret
Harr Stephen,
Harr Henry
Duran and my
wife's aunt Renee
Allert, who are all taken
too. Soon in horrible,
horrible violence.
Um With that,
uh,  Mr.  President, I move that
Senate bill 96
do now pass and I ask unanimous
consent to the Senate that the record
show that the role has been called
and all those present voted
in the affirmative
except all
those,
except those voting in the negative by a
show of hands. Thank you, Senator Me. So
senators, we're all senators
to your seats,
please.
If you wish to vote, no, please
raise your hand.
Senator Tip Pino voting.
No, Senator
mckenna voting.
No senator
souls voting.
No,
Senator Pope voting
no
by a vote of 32 in the
affirmative four in the negative Senate bill
96 has
passed the Senate. Senator
Maestas. Thank you,  Mr.  President.
I'd like to thank our house sponsor who
just signed up. So her name wasn't on
the board. Uh, Cynthia Borrego.
Thank you members. Thank
you, Senator. We're on
to item number four on the
calendar
and I yelled to Senator
Stewart.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. I ask
unanimous consent of the Senate
that the records show that all action
placing house
judiciary committee substitute
for house Bill. 41
on final passage has been
taken. It's now subject
to debate, amendment
or substitution. Thank you,
Senator Stewart. See no objection.
If you'll explain
the bill, please,
Mr.  President, I ask
unanimous consent to have
experts on the
floor. Secretary
James Kinney
from the Environment
Department and Michelle
Miano. Thank
you, Senator Stewart. See, no
objection of Sergeant
Arms. If you can
please escort the expert witnesses
into the chamber and provide them their
seats.
Mister President. I'm happy for the
opportunity to
present 41
this evening. This is a
bill that has passed
the Senate twice
a first time in
2021
and second in 2020.
I'm quite thrilled with this
version of the bill. It's,
it's the best and most
exclusive one yet.
Stewart, if you can put that on final
passage, please.
Oh, thank you so
much,
Mister President, I move
that.
I already did
that.
Go ahead, Senator Stewart, my
apologies.
So I want you to
take away three things from
my presentation
today. A
reminder and a general
understanding about how
the clean fuel standard
works.
The potential for a
clean fuel standard
as an engine for
economic growth for
both rural and urban
communities
and how these same
communities will benefit
from the decreased
air pollution from use of
clean fuels over
time. So
first, this is how the clean
fuel standard works
under this bill. An
advisory committee
including representatives
from fuel producers
and importers,
tribal governments,
utilities and environmental
groups will come together and
help the New Mexico Environment
Department create the Clean
Fuels Program.
This bill provides the
statutory authority and
associate guardrails
to make it work
under this program. The New
Mexico Environment Department
with assistance from the
advisory committee will
create a carbon
intensity standard
for transportation
fuels the
carbon intensity
of transportation
fuels is measured
by calculating the
life cycle of a fuels
emissions based
on science bases
methods. The
setting of the carbon
intensity standard
creates the clean
transportation fuels
market which
applies to transportation
fuels only
produced and
imported for use in New
Mexico.
So transportation
fuels at or
below the carbon intensity
standard
generates fuel,
clean fuel
credits
for transportation
fuels that exceed
the carbon intensity
standard. Those
producers or
importers would have
to go to clean fuels market
to purchase a credit
if they'd like their
fuels to be used
in the state of New
Mexico.
The bill then requires a
reduction in the
carbon intensity of
transportation fuels
used in the state
by at least
20%
below the 2018
carbon intensity levels
by 2030
30%
below the 2018
carbon intensity levels
by 2040.
These are real
tangible
carbon
reductions.
In fact, an entity
cannot generate a clean
fuel credit unless they
actually reduce
their greenhouse gas
emissions.
So this brings me to my second
point. The real
beauty of this program
is the incentive it
provides for
innovation,
economic
opportunity
and investment in the clean
fuels market and associated
infrastructure.
You heard from Senator Munoz
a little while earlier,
thanking us for being
innovative and creative.
Well, you can be super
innovative and creative by
supporting this program.
We estimate that it will
bring an estimated
470
million quick
start projects
between now and
2023
1600
permanent jobs,
2300 construction
jobs and
240
million capital
investment in
production and
manufacturing.
So when I was in
finance today,
they asked my
cosponsor
about the companies
that want to come here.
Uh  Mr.  President, I
gave Senator Burt a list
of 22 companies that
say they're interested in coming
here. I'll just mention
a few of them. Now,
Rocky Mountain Farmers
Union, they believe
we're on the right step
here.
The coalition for
renewable natural
gas,
three degrees
charge point, clean
energy, green
plains
NGV, America,
Oberon, Rivian
suburban
propane
foes inc all
of these companies want to
come to New Mexico
to produce clean
fuel. Uh
We need a good
program to help them come
here and this is what
this will do for us.
So because this new
market measures the
entire carbon
footprint of transportation
fuels, there
is an incentive to decrease
footprint of
these fuels by producing
them closer to the users
here in our
region in New
Mexico.
And let me be clear, this is
not an electric
car bill for urban
city dwellers.
This is a real
opportunity for our
rural communities
to sell agricultural
residuals
and other waste
into biofuels.
Perhaps some will remember
Senator Soul. We
always smelled the peanuts
when that little car that
was running on,
on,
on
fuel waste
from
restaurants.
We want to sell these agriculture
reso resid residuals
in other ways that will make
our biofuels our
rural areas will finally
have access to drop-in
renewable diesel for
vehicles.
Comes to my third
point and that is
health.
These quickstart
projects can help all
of our communities no longer have
to choose between transportation
on one side and health on the
other
one in seven.
New Mexicans
has a respiratory
illness.
It costs about
$303,300
a year for each
of those
Children, mostly
that have asthma
or repres respiratory
illness. It's really not
acceptable.
So health is a huge concern
for us from climate impacts
from greenhouse gas emissions
and associated air
pollutants like
ground level
ozone and
particulate matter. Our
residents are
experiencing
adverse effects on
themselves and their
families in
Oregon, one of the
five or six states that already
have this program, they've
resulted in an $80
million decrease in health
costs. We want
those decreases
here.
So as a final note, I'd
like to address the
fearmongering that goes
on that. This program will raise
gasoline prices by
double digits.
The last time I did this
bill.
Um I saw a
picture of a gas
station in uh
Los
Angeles.
Um I took a screenshot
of it
for uh
for regular,
it's
$4.79
for the clean fuel
product at the bottom.
It's
$3.19.
That's a dollars
60 less a
gallon for the
clean fuel
in a Los
Angeles gas
station.
It's just not true
that this will raise gas
prices. It hasn't done
it in any of the other
states that have this.
Now, there's no
evidence that
show that clean
fuel credit prices
correlate to any gas
prices at all.
So in conclusion,
um all of our constituencies
want us to come to Santa Fe to
bring back more
resources.
All of our consti
constituents want
innovation, creativity,
economic
investment.
We all want jobs and
new business opportunities.
We want infrastructure
investment, especially
for tribal and rural
communities. We
want to take care of our most
valuable.
We want to make sure that low-income
communities aren't paying
too much for daily needs
like transportation,
fuel, nor
living right
on the edge and
getting those ground
level ozone.
We don't want to subject our
family to respiratory
illnesses and we want
them to stop paying for
medical costs that comes
along with it. There
are a few programs out there that can
check all these boxes. The clean
fuel standards is
one of these programs.
Mr.  President, I stand for
questions. Thank you, Senator
Stewart. We do have
an amendment.
The reader to
read
amendment.
Senate Floor amendment
number one to House Judiciary
Committee, substitute
for House Bill
41 amendment
sponsored by Senator
William E Scherr.
Senator Scher to move
and explain the amendment. Thank
you,  Mr.  President, I move. Senate
Floor Amendment number one to House
judiciary committee. Substitute
for House Bill 41.
See, no objections. Senator
Scher, if you'll explain what the amendment
does. So, Mister
President,
we've heard several times
here about clean fuel and how
we have to decarbonize.
That seems to be the goal
decarbonize. If we're going to keep the
temperature down
below 1.5
°C, we need to decarbonize.
I've heard that over and over and over
again. Ok,
I accept that
what this does is
allows us to
decarbonize. There's
really two things
that we need to consider how
much carbon we're putting
in, in and how much carbon we're
taking out.
So, under this clean fuel
standards, uh transportation,
fuel standards, we
talk about just taking,
not putting any more
in.
Ok, I'm
with you. But
what about the co two that's already in the
air today?
It's there
right now. So
what are we gonna do about it?
Well, what this amendment does
is it defines the
geological,
uh sequestration
of CO2.
And so there's a couple of things that
we need to do if we're serious
about taking CO2 out of the air.
If we're, if we're absolutely
straight up serious about
it,
we have to put it
somewhere.
And so where are we going to put it? You
can't burn it,
you can't crush
it. It's got to
go somewhere.
And so what this amendment
does is
allow
for two things.
One, the definition of
the ownership of the,
the poor space which
my attorney refuses to
use. But the
geological sequestration,
that's the space in
between the sand particles
underneath our
feet.
So who owns that?
Now, there's been big deal
about who owns it. The surface
owner owns it. The surface owner
owns everything from the surface
to the center of the earth,
less whatever
mineral rights they've sold in
the, in the
meantime,
but in this amendment
that clarifies it clearly.
And this is important
because the people that
want to sequester co
two want to make
sure they're, they're
dealing with the right person,
the right entity.
And so this clarifies
ownership
and that's important because
if we put CO2 in the
ground under my
house and it
migrates to under your
house and we've not dealt
with that, then we
have a trespassing
issue. So
what this does is, is
clarify
what all that's about
so that every owner of
the surface,
thus owner of the, the
space below the surface
is then properly
compensated.
OK? So that we know
who owns that.
And so this amendment does
that first,
the second thing that people that
want to take the CO2 out
of the air
need is some kind
of understanding of their
liability.
It doesn't make sense to make a
company liable
for
eons.
It does make sense to make them
liable for some time.
And then what happens after
that? Well,
in this particular
amendment, what we've done is
we've said ok,
you are liable as the,
as the person putting the co
two in the ground,
you are liable
until you have done these
steps. So
there was this thing about, oh, well, is it
gonna be for 15 years or 10
years or 100 years? Whatever it
is? What we've
done here is say, if
you've done these six
items,
that's when your liability
ends.
And so I can, I
can tell you what those six items
are
a, you've done everything
in compliance with the
law.
Number one, number two,
you resolved all pending
claims regarding
sequestration.
Ok. Number three, the
sequestration
unit,
the second I went too
fast. Um,
the sequestration unit
is reasonably expected to
retain the
CO2 stored
in it. That means that we have
geologists. We've got scientists,
we, we know where that
CO2 is. We know
where it's likely to go.
And so we've, we've,
we've covered that
base.
The co two that has
been stored is
stable and
again, we have the ability
to know that we can tell
you whether it's stable or
not.
All wells, equipment
facilities
um to be used following
the cessation
of in
injection.
Wow, are in
good condition and retain
mechanical integrity
and it's been plugged all
wells and
removed all
equipment facilities
unless such are needed to
use follow-ups for
the, for the station
of this. So
instead of putting a, a factual
timeline on there, because
15 years,
things might not be right
but they might be right in
12. And
so what this does is
allows that.
So now we have these industries
that want to take co two
out of the air.
We've given them
certainty in what to
do. We've clearly
identified
who the owners are that they need
to deal with. And we've clearly
identified the certainty
that they need before we
bring this new industry
in.
And so some of the
things that the sponsor of the bill
talked about was
carbon
offsets.
So what we need, if we're going
to do this
in, in, in, in testimony
earlier in committee,
uh they said this is
uh technology
neutral,
so it doesn't matter who does
it, it's neutral.
So anybody that can, that
can deal with CO2
is
good
but not if they don't know what to do
with it, they
have to know what to do with it. And
like I said, there's two
parts, how
much you're actually producing and putting
in the air and then what do you do with
the stuff that's already in the
air?
So it appears that
this bill only deals
specifically
with the part
about what you're producing and putting in the
air. It doesn't deal with
the other part of how you get it out of the
air. So I think
this is a
complementary
amendment that works
well with what we've got going on
here.
It is impossible,
Mr.  President to
stop all
oil and gas production.
It's just straight up impossible
right now.
Partly
because not
all oil and gas production
is fuel.
Mr.  President.
If I were to ask you
to remove every piece of
clothing
that was not pure
cotton or
pure silk or
pure wool.
It would be very embarrassing for
all of us in this
chamber
because almost none of our
clothing is pure
anything. Most
of it is synthetic.
The carpet on the floor is
synthetic.
The paint on the walls is synthetic.
The soundproofing panels around
here are synthetic.
All of the plastics that go
into an electric vehicle are
synthetic. All of the
plastics that go in a conventional
vehicle are synthetic.
That means they're all
produced using
fossil fuels, all of
them. So
we can't just
stop.
That's impossible.
But because it's impossible,
there are things we can
do
and we can actually
decarbonize.
We have to know where to put
the carbon, the co
two.
And what's interesting,  Mr.  President
is all of
this
that I'm talking about now
actually came from the Department
of Energy.
Not a weird thing
from President
Trump,
but from President
Obama's Department
of Energy. President
Obama's Department of Energy
actually likes and
promote, promoted
carbon capture and
sequestration.
And that's what I'm talking about right
now, but you have to sequester
it somewhere and that's
because there is no single
solution. And actually
in testimony and finance committee,
they agree there's not a single
solution,
technology neutral.
There's a lot of things that we can
do
if we want to.
But the bottom line is if you don't
have a place to put the
CO2,
we can't finish
the job.
And so if that's what we're trying to
do that, we
need to consider this with
all seriousness.
What we have now is we
have some amazing
technology that
is called direct air
capture.
So you can put the direct air
capture
equipment
almost anywhere.
So
if you
are
uh
making
steel,
it's very difficult to
take the co two out of the
production of steel.
But if you have direct air
capture, you can still
take the co two out of the
air at that
point.
And if we know where to put the
CO2, then
we can deal with it
when you're making concrete. The
same way,
it takes a lot of power to make
concrete or steel.
Therefore, it takes a lot of
it produces a lot of co
two. If
we can capture the co two
from the air
and we know where to put
it, then we've
reduced the carbon
uh footprint in our
sky.
And I think this is a very important
part.
I know that earlier today,
I talked about flies
and bugs and
whatever. But this is, this is
absolute serious
stuff.
If we can take
the carbon out of the air,
we have to know where to put
it. And we know
how to take the carbon out of the
air.
We can do that
today.
We even know where to put it
today because
in most of San Juan County,
as an example. But also
in much of the rest of the, the
state,
we know what's below our
feet. We
know how deep it is. We know what
it is. We know the geological
formations that are below our
feet. We know
where we can put CO2 and where
we
can't.
We have the technology to,
to, to drill the
wells. They're called
class six wells. They
exist
today.
This is not
newfangled
technology.
This is technology that
exists
today
today. We can capture the
carbon out of the air
today. We
can put it in the ground and
sequester it.
And with this amendment,
what we've done is we've,
we've allowed the companies
that want to do this
certainty of what they have
to do, certainty
of what landowners they need to
deal with and certainty
of when their liability is,
is exhausted.
And I think that that
is the key
piece if
we're going to do this, if
we're serious about this,
we have to deal with that
portion of it.
So with that mister,
oh, let me back one more
thing, carbon offsets,
carbon offsets. There are
companies all over the world that want carbon
offsets.
There's a, there's a major
airline company in
Georgia that wants
carbon offsets because they're going
to continue to fly jet planes,
burning jet fuel. Therefore
putting CO2 in the sky.
But what they would like to
do is pay
a company in New
Mexico
to remove an equivalent
amount of CO2
from the air,
they can't ground their
aircraft,
but they can pay
us in
New Mexico
to remove an equivalent
amount of CO two.
That's a positive.
That's a good thing.
It does a couple of things for us.
A it reduces the carbon
footprint.
B all
of a sudden we become,
we have now
economic based
industry and
economic based industry is where
somebody from. Georgia pays
somebody from New Mexico to
do a job.
It's not where New Mexicans pay
other new Mexicans to flip
burgers in, in
Senator Schmidty's favourite
restaurant.
This is a, this is a
true economic
development and
true
carbon reduction. So
with that,  Mr.  President,
I'll, I'll anxiously
await for the sponsor to say this is
a friendly amendment. Thank you,
Senator Chair. We are debating
Senator Farmer number one and I'll yield
to the sponsor, Senator
Stewart.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. So
certainly Senator shares
friendly,
but his amendment is
not,
his amendment would
change this bill
drastically.
But I want to tell him that
if he's interested in carbon
sequestration, I know
he is that,
that's not precluded
by the current version of this
bill if he will
look into section four
page nine,
uh additional
credit opportunities
from activities and
projects that support
the reduction or
removal of greenhouse
gas emissions associated
with transportation in the
state. That's
in the part that
shows what you can make
rules around. So
we believe that this
bill could
certainly answer some of his
questions, but this amendment
is unfriendly. Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Stewart. We do have others
who would like to debate. Senator Floor Amendment
number one. I'll start with Senator
Ebert.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Will the sponsor of the
amendment yield? Senator
share the yield? Absolutely,
Mr.  President. Thank you, Senator
Nibert. So  Mr.
President,
it looks
like
the thrust of your
amendment is to
create a carbon
sequestration
mechanism by
which CO
two would be
permanently
sequestered in
geologic formations. Is
that accurate? Thank you,
Senator Nibert. That is absolutely
accurate. Mister President
and mister President,
the
I guess the person
or the entity that
is sequestering that
carbon
dioxide
would then receive some
sort of
compensation
for having done. So
maybe in terms of credit or
other remuneration. But
is that how that
works?
Yes,  Mr.  President. So there's two
things, one,
if a major airline
who's
uh
headquarters is in Georgia
would pay for
this. So that's
how they would make some money, but
there are also
federal tax credits
that were created again,
not under weird President
Trump, but
under President
Obama.
So there's two forms,
one, it would be paid by
other businesses
and two, there are tax credits,
Senator Neighbor
and mister President,
the
party who
wishes to
sell.
I believe the term
is
carbon
intense
fuel.
They would need
to
purchase
some credits or
pay consideration to
someone to acquire
those credits to
offset the carbon
intensity of that fuel
under the bill. Is
that correct,
Mr.  President? That is
exactly correct.
Thank you, Senator
and  Mr.  President with
without that
uh ability to
secure
credit.
How else is
the,
how else is the carbon
going to be uh
sequestered
or captured that
results in the credit
being
uh
formulated in the first
instance?
So  Mr.  President, that
is, that is a great question.
Nobody is going to
invest this kind of money
because this takes
money.
Nobody's gonna invest this kind
of money unless
there's some return on their
investment. Nobody
is just doing this out of the
kindness of their heart
because it's very, very
expensive.
In this case, we're not
asking the state to
put any money into
anything.
We're simply asking that the
rules be
clear,
an industry,
even some of the industries on
Senator on the sponsor's
list,
those industries
want this
clarity.
So
I think that it helps the industries
that she's mentioned and it
certainly helps the state,
but you have to have some kind
of return
on the investment and, and this
simply allows for that
to happen.
Thank you, Senator Chair Senator
Ibert. And so
Mr.  President and
sponsor, would
you see the
two of
the original bill?
And your amendment is
necessarily going hand
in hand to
accomplish
the uh results
of getting
uh
a reduction
of carbon dioxide
from sources
within the state of New
Mexico?
Mr.  President. Absolutely.
I know the sponsor of the bill talked
about nothing in her bill
prevents carbon
capture. And I
agree,
I agree.
But in
this particular case,
it makes it clear
for the people who want to do
it, what
they need to do. It makes it very
clear. So this is
I believe
complementary to her
effort. This is not, this
isn't trying to destroy her effort
at all. I, you know, in, in my
amendment, I struck nothing of,
of that bill,
nothing of House Bill or
House Judiciary Committee substitute
for House Bill. 41 is
stricken
all of that still exist.
This is complementary
in order for
real life on
the ground. What do
people really do if they
want to decarbonize?
That's what my amendment
does. I believe
it's, it's an
enhancement to
the bill. Certainly not
an enemy of the
bill.
Thank you, Senator Sheriff Senator
Ibert.  Mr.  President, is
there anything in your
amendment that
requires
new technology
or is the technology to
be deployed
proven and already
in existence in
the state of New Mexico?
Senator Share. So  Mr.
President, that's, that's
interesting. Uh And, and
a beautiful question.
First of all,  Mr.  President,
the wells that carb
that CO2 would be
are class six
wells, that's a federal
designation, but class
six wells exist
in New Mexico
today.
The carbon capture the direct
air carbon capture
exists in
New Mexico
today. So
this isn't unproven
unknown technology
these exist.
But if we want the technology
to grow, if we want the industry
to grow, if we want to be
a world leader,
we simply need to give them
just a little bit of clarification.
This clarification, I have
been told opens
us up to an
a brand new industry
which we keep
hearing that we have to have because
of oil and gas ups and
downs
all of a sudden if we do
this, if we make this clarity
with proven technology
in New
Mexico.
Then we really have done what
we've, what we've told
people we want to do. We've
actively
reduce the amount of CO2
in the air and we've
actively
created an
economic
engine for the
state
Senator Nibert and  Mr.
President. Um
Are you aware that
we have been
injecting
CO2
as well as
producing CO2 in
the state of New Mexico for
well over 40
years,
Mr.  President.
Absolutely. we
have been doing this but you know
the other thing,  Mr.
President
and there, there are
CO2 wells, we, we,
we're taking CO2 out
what we and that mostly goes
to greenhouses and things like
that.
But if we do this
at this level, we
are putting far more co
two in the ground
sequestering it
permanently
than, than anything
else we could do
so from this perspective,
yes, we've been doing this
and we've been doing it
successfully
for as long as Senator Ingle
was in the Senate.
Uh  Mr.  President,
if I read the
amendment
correctly,
the
places that you're
calling to sequester
this CO2
is really
uh
in
formations that
are not
currently being
utilized for the
uh injection of
CO2, but these would be
new formations that would
be capable of
receiving CO2
that are beyond
what I consider
oil and gas, tertiary
recovery efforts.
Absolutely, Mister
President. So if you can
imagine we have the
surface of the,
of the earth and
then whatever's down there, the
co two would not go into
anything else except
a proven formation
that could hold
it.
And in most of the state,
we know where those
formations are.
And so that's where it
would go, it would not go into
anybody else's property.
It would go into a formation
that we know could hold that co
two forever.
Senator and  Mr.
President. The
mechanism by
which you are purporting
to sequester
this carbon dioxide
is what
I would call
in, in oil and gas parlance
and exploratory
uh oil and gas
unit, but it would not involve
oil and gas. It, it's
basically
a unit which
is an
area defined
by
usually a reservoir.
In this case, the
rock that would be capable
of receiving the
CO2. You'd
try to define the outer
limits of that
uh area that would
be capable of storing the
CO2. And
then you would have a mechanism
to consolidate
all those tracts of
land for purposes
of injecting your
CO2. And if I
recall correctly, there's a buffer
zone beyond those
limits to make sure
that uh uh
when we form
these, we're not going to
allow the trespass
of that CO2 to occur
on lands that are not
unitized is that the
mechanism by which you're
proposing the
sequestration,
Mr.  President. That is, that is
exactly the mechanism.
So what we, what we
know from other
efforts in our state,
we know where the formations
formations are,
that we can do this the
same as we know where oil and
gas and water exist
underneath our feet today,
we know that, but
in this case, we would go
further than that, we would make sure
that we knew the outer
boundaries of where the C
two might migrate.
And that's the first part,
the ownership.
So  Mr.  President, as I described
early is
if, if, if the well is
under land I own,
but the co two moves under
land you own, well, you should
be compensated for that.
And so that's why we want to know where
that outer boundary is
to make sure that everybody
whose land may be
impacted, even though
it's thousands of
feet below their
surface,
still in the land of the the
surface owner, that
they be properly compensated
and they understand exactly what's
going on. So that's
exactly
as as
Senator Nibert described,
that's exactly how it happens.
Thank you, Senator Sheriff, Senator
Nibert and  Mr.  President.
If in
addition to this buffer
area that's being
created,
I believe
the, the amendment
calls for uh
various monitoring
to occur within that
area
for
evidence of the
migration of the carbon
dioxide, evidence
of the pressures that are
being
uh
utilized to inject
as well as the pressure of
the formation
and
determining whether or not
there's any seismic
issues that might arise from
that A I reading that
correctly,  Mr.
President. Exactly.
And in this
particular case, when we talk
about liability
of the items that I
read the carbon
dioxide in the
sequestered unit has
become stable.
And how you measure that
is by checking
all of the things that Senator Nibert
said, we know where it
went because we can measure
it because we can, we
can have the,
the wells that go down and
understand where all that is.
We know that geology down
there.
But even if something
was wrong, the
liability of whoever
injected it isn't
released until all
the the stability
issues have been
resolved.
So we have to monitor,
monitor it up to
that level to
make sure that we've got
that.
And  Mr.  President,
would there be
uh a variety
of geographic
areas within the state
that uh
maybe New Mexico Tech
or other uh
institutions of higher
learning have uh
evidenced
our
susceptible
to these
types of uh
sequestration
units and
can
uh hold
the carbon dioxide that would
be injected
for basically
all perpetuity.
So  Mr.  President, it's,
it's interesting that he
mentioned New Mexico
Tech. So this isn't
something coming from some
foreign university
from some foreign nation like Montana
or someplace.
This is New Mexico
Tech is already
doing this and studying
this and have already
put some wells in the
ground to make sure.
So New
Mexicans,
New Mexico Universities
are already involved in
this effort. And
so we know now
where a lot of these places
are, but because
New Mexico Tech would continue
to look for them, we may find
other places but
at the same time, we may find places
that says, nope, don't do it
here, not the right
formations in this area.
So I think
that the fact that we
have the
premier
research university
in the, at least in the country,
maybe the world right here in New Mexico.
Looking at this,
I think that's uh should
solve most of our
angst about this. Thank
you, Senator Senator
Ibert. So
Mr.  President,
um
we have
as a state
through that university,
maybe others
have engaged
in in these studies.
And as I mentioned
earlier for well over 40
years, the issue
of uh carbon
dioxide being injected
into the earth, albeit
for production
of petroleum resources.
Uh the technology
that's been gathered
around that
is
capable of being
transported and
utilized in this
very new concept
of injecting CO2
into non
oil and gas bearing formations
for sequestration
purposes. And
so  Mr.  President,
it seems to me that,
that this goes hand
in hand with
the uh requirement
that we
impose this
clean fuel standard
and need
to uh
provide these
credits if you will
for carbon
intense
transportation
fuels and
that we need to
have
that very market
developed. And if we
can do that in state
without having to buy
uh maybe credits
from out of state
uh places or, or
otherwise, it
makes sense to deal
with both issues
at the same time. And I think
that this vehicle that
uh uh senator
that you've developed
is a uh
fruitful
development. I think it's
something that, that bears
uh uh
some, some
fruit. And I think that
ultimately, if
we are serious
about
reducing
carbon
from New Mexico
sources,
we ourselves are going to
have a, have to have a
place to place that
carbon within
geologic formations
within our state.
And I think that our state,
as you pointed out,
Senator can
be the leader in
this.
We have the technology,
we have the experts
80 miles south
of Albuquerque
that uh know
about reservoir engineering.
They know about the
capabilities of,
of injecting carbon
dioxide and they certainly
know about
geology.
And so it seems to me
that uh your
amendment goes hand in hand
with the, the the
bill that's being proposed
and that without
it,
well, maybe I should ask the
question with, without
your
amendment.
Are we going to be able
to secure
or create this carbon
market that's going to allow
these uh carbon
intensity fuels to
be uh to
receive the proper credits
that they need.
Mr.  President? I do not
believe so.
In order for the offsets
to happen, if
we are going to be
the economic engine for
these, we have to have
this certainty.
This does not interfere with
anything else in, in in the
bill.
This doesn't challenge
biomass, it doesn't
challenge anything else that
might happen out there.
This simply
makes it
clear
for new
businesses
that we know how to deal with their
CO two.
So it's not only reduction of
New Mexico sources,
it's reduction of all the sourcess
in the continent
so that, you know, we can
take millions and millions
of tons of Co2
out of the air.
And because CO2 is Mo
Mobile when the
wind blows it from California
to here, we can take it out of the
air.
And so that's
why I don't think that this is
unfriendly in, in and
with all due respect to the
sponsor for
as much grief as I give her
occasionally, this is, this
is real and I
think beneficial
to her bill
because the things
that, that, that
she's asking and, and
the people around her are
asking this does
not interfere with at all. It
enhances our
ability to do
that. And
so I believe that
Senator Nibert, I don't know how
he possibly figured this out,
but I believe Senator Nibert has
figured out exactly what this bill
does and I see
that, that this
is a
mutually
beneficial.
Thank you. Thank you, Senator
and Senator  Mr.
President. Uh One
other point, um
Does your
amendment
provide for
compensation to
the owners of land
that are impacted or
are utilized
for purposes of
sequestering this carbon
dioxide on their
land?
Mister President.
Absolutely. That's part of
what the definition of the ownership
is. So that even
if I don't know that the co two
might migrate under my
land because I'm miles and miles
away from where it's being
injected,
the company that's doing, it has to
reach out to me
and, and
make sure that I am properly
compensated
for the use of my
land even though it's
12,000 ft below my
feet.
And so  Mr.  President,
uh it
seems like this could
be, could
result in some of the things
that the sponsor of this legislation
talked about in
enhancing uh
maybe some economic
opportunities and maybe
even providing for some job
growth. Looks to me like
this is a very mechanism
by which that job growth
would occur. Is it
not
Mr.  President? That's exactly
the point.
This helps create new
Mexico jobs
which are economic based
jobs because
because somebody from outside
the state will be paying
new Mexicans.
And in the case of the,
the injector of
CO two, they may be
in New Mexico
but they're paying New Mexico
landowners as
well. So
the out of state companies are paying
the in-state company, the in-state
companies paying the
landowner. It's a
win, win, win,
win, it wins
for the companies that
want the offset.
It wins for economic
based jobs in New Mexico, it
wins for the landowner
and it wins for for
carbon
CO2 reduction from the
atmosphere.
Uh  Mr.  President, it seems
to me that this
amendment goes hand in
hand and that
without it, we
really don't
have anything complementary.
We're going to do this. I
think we have to
have a place to
store and
sequester the carbon
dioxide. That is the goal
of
a lot of this
legislation a lot of the
concerns of this
nation at this time is
to reduce the
carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere. And your
amendment is bringing
forth the mechanism by
which New Mexico,
New Mexico citizens
can uh
see some
real benefits as
well as receive
some compensation for
the use of their property
in connection with that
effort. So with
that, uh  Mr.
President and,
and uh
Senator Shearer, I appreciate
your amendment and I will
support it. Thank
you. Thank
you, Senator Nibert.
Ok,
senators, we are debating Senate
Floor amendment. Number one,
see no further debate on
Senate floor amendment. Number one, senator
share to close on the
amendment.
So madam
President, I do hope
that to sponsor the bill
and the house
sponsor
can look at this as
as enhancing,
not, not interfering.
Yes, earlier today,
I know because II I
have problems with the
bill.
There's no doubt and she
heard about him,
but I honestly believe
that this helps the
bill. It
certainly helps the bill from my
personal perspective.
I think it helps to build from a lot
of industry
perspectives.
I do not see this
as, as changing
her bill. I
know that she said that nothing in
there prevents or in her bill
prevents this.
But what prevents
carbon capture
today
is the lack of
clarity.
And so I have simply
given the sponsor of the bill,
sponsors of the bill
the opportunity to have
clarity
so that they can do exactly
what they say they want to do
and that's to reduce co
two in the atmosphere.
And so with that  Mr.  President,
I now move the Senate floor amendment
number one to house judiciary
committee, substitute
for House Bill 41 do
now pass.
And I am actually going to ask
unanimous consent of the Senate that
the records show that the role has been
called and all those present voted
in the affirmative except
those voting in the negative.
And I hope all of you vote in a
positive by a show of hands.

believe that this was an

a poison pill, but
the vote is the vote. Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Thank you, Senator Scher.
We're back on the bill.
Senators
seeing no further debate.
Senator
Schmitty.
Thank you.
Um,
Mr.  President, I just wanted
to kind of
give kind of one
this, this might be my last
opportunity to,
uh, discuss
how we are
developing energy
policy
and some
folks on the tax committee have already
had a little bit of a, a
taste of
my views but, you know, the
hours late, I don't know how many
people are watching
at home, how
many people are up in the gallery or
stakeholders. But I'm gonna
take the opportunity
to,
um, just give, give my
two
cents
mister President. I'd like to make
the case and I'd like to propose
a question to
you
if you,
I mean, I, I imagine most
people that are gonna vote yes
for a bill like
this most
likely believe in
evolution.
So you believe
that the origin of
life
began with
a chance, combination of
nonliving things and then
evolved
um over billions of years
into more complex life
forms. If you believe
that
I would like to ask you to
reconcile that
belief with
your position
on energy
policy because
I'm gonna make the argument that those
are self
contradictory
that it's
impossible
to have a position
as an evolutionist but also
to support a bill like this
based on
or
our entire
framework
for
squashing oil and
gas and moving
toward
solar and
wind.
Let me explain,
Mister President a couple
of decades ago, some researchers
at Stanford University, they
coined the phrase
return on
energy
return on energy. This is the
ratio of the energy
that you have to expend in order to
consume some energy. So
let's just imagine an animal that
has to expend energy chasing
down its
food
or imagine a person, if we
had to expend
or, you know, expend
1000 calories just to get a
piece of celery.
Well, you, you see
where that would go, it wouldn't go very
well.
Now, these researchers
also say that this,
this return on energy
principle is, is basically the
defining characteristic
of evolution that
it is ultimately about the
competition for
energy.
So I'd like to ask yourself,
let's, let's look then
at, at supposedly
what evolution
has given us then
as you know, just to remind you, I'm
not a, not an evolutionist, I'm a creationist,
but let's let's take that
argument.
What kind of life forms
use
the sun
directly for their
energy.
Let's just take trees,  Mr.
President,
my favourite kind of tree in the whole
world is a sequoia
tree. I was
raised going out to California
in the summertime.
My great grandfather was a fruit
farmer
in the San Joaquin Valley.
He was a fruit inspector and a fruit farmer
and he built a
cabin
um up in
Kings Canyon National
Park where
the most beautiful trees
in the country are. In fact, our nation's
Christmas tree is a Sequoia
in Sequoia National Park, which is
just adjacent to Kings Canyon
National Park.
So I want you to think about a big
giant Sequoia tree
that relies on
photosynthesis for its
energy.
Trees don't move, they
don't expand,
they don't make dense energy
expenditures to go
get their
energy.
They grow very, very
slowly. They
don't drive Teslas
down the highway.
Mr.
President.
That's what we see. So
if return on energy is the
defining characteristic of
evolution,
how in the world
are we going to use
solar
for these high energy
expenditures? How are we going to get
rid of our energy dense
substances and
tax them and
create all these fees and
squash those energy
dense
forms
of energy and shift
to this energy sparse
nonsense. I say that
respectfully because I believe it's
going to destroy the earth and I'll explain that
in just a minute.
So
mister President, let's let's move on
from
life forms that
get their energy from energy
sparse sources such as the
sun.
And let's let's
look at at something that
eats,
say grass.
Ok. We would
define grass as a producer.
It relies on photosynthesis
for, for its energy
to develop
its energy inside high high
energy phosphate bonds
inside
inside its cells.
What can come and eat the
grass?
Let's just take a cow. For
example,
I don't think we'd make a
comparison
to a high energy
expenditure like driving a Tesla
down the down the interstate.
Mister President cows just
kind of graze nice
and slow and
methodically as they
eat that grass,
but cows don't revolt.
They don't
uh
they don't depend on the
sunlight. What has the grass
done? The grass has already
condensed that
energy
into complex
sugars.
So the cow doesn't have to do that
extra work.
Therefore, the cow can make
a better return on its
energy. It doesn't have
to do all of the work
to both eat the grass
and to do the work that the
grass has done. It
doesn't have to condense
all of those photons,
Mister President.
So that's where it gets its
energy.
Let's go up to the highest
level
for my uh
metaphor here.
Let's talk about a
Cheetah
cheetahs make extremely
high energy expenditures
to get their energy.
But they still, from an evolutionary
standpoint, they still
have an advantageous return
on energy. How
do they do that? They expend
enormous amounts of energy
chasing down antelopes,
but they are
rewarded
with a net
energy to fuel
their
lives.
They make that kill and you
know what they, they eat first, Mister
President, they eat the
highest energy, most
nutrient dense
portions of
the antelope. They start with the
heart and the
liver.
Is there any coincidence to
that? Is
there any coincidence to that,
Mister President?
No,
they expend all that energy
and they're rewarded with very
energy dense
sources to
fuel their way of
life. Does this, is this starting
to sound
familiar?
Do Cheetahs rely
on solar energy?
No impossible. We
do not see that anywhere,
supposedly
over evolution over billions
of years. We don't see
anything like that. We don't
see any model
anywhere close to what we're
trying to do with our energy
policy. Cheetahs
don't have leaves. It would not be
possible for a Cheetah
to try to gather up all those
photons to
fuel
an antelope
punt.
They have to rely on
dense, dense energy
sources to supply
their way of
life.
So who are the Cheetahs?  Mr.
President?
Let's think about our
lifestyle,
let's think about our
lifestyle.
What kind of energy
expenditures
do we make
in our modern
lifestyle?
Well, I've already mentioned one.
We drive cars
7075
miles an hour, 80 miles
an hour. Or if you're
driving between Albuquerque and
Santa Fe 90
miles an hour down the
road.
And I'd pose a question once again
if you're an evolutionist,
do you see any justification
or any return on
energy
for justifying
powering
these
cars?
Let's be honest, that
are spending a lot more
energy than Cheetahs
are.
Do we have any business powering
those cars with
wind or solar
is a terrible,
terrible return on
energy?
You really think we're gonna beat
supposedly 11
billion years
of evolution,
survival of the fittest.
And we're gonna model
model a policy off
of complete.
This is not meant to be
offensive or pejorative
but complete hogwash.
We don't see any, any
sort of analog or
principle
in nature
to justify
what we're doing with our energy
policy. It is
going to destroy the planet
because it is so
energy
inefficient.
This is the basic laws of
physics that once again, have
supposedly
been the driver for
evolution.
And  Mr.  President, what
about our H vacs,
our microwaves,
the lights in our
homes,
jets,
all of these super
high energy
expenditures.
So I would think if I was an
evolutionist looking out
at nature, I would say, wow,
I'm going to model our energy
policy off of this because
it's the most efficient
follows the laws of nature
and physics.
How would I do that? Engineers do
this all the time, by the way, it's called
biomimicry
where they try to engineer the
most amazing
principles that they see in
nature and try to try
to replicate
those.
But let's let's flip it around
and, and see
how we would design
energy policy that would
be guided by so-called
evolutionary
principles.
So if we are the metaphorical
Cheetah, Mister President, if we are
having the most higher
energy
energy dense
expenditures,
then you would think we wouldn't
be powering those
with sunlight or
energy sparse sources
as if we were trees or
grass, we would be
fuelling our way of life
with very energy
dense
fuels.
You would think we'd be moving
forward, Mister President
and not
backwards,
not back from
oil, which is a
very energy dense
substance,
not back
to wind and
solar, but
forward.
And you see where this is going toward
nuclear, toward the
most energy dense
form of fuel
that we have
to fuel our energy
dense way
of life
that would actually match
the evolutionary principles
that I think many people in this
room believe
in
ever heard of E equals MC
squared. I don't know
what C squared is, but it
is a massive
number,
Mr.  President
that is the most energy dense
technology that we
have.
So  Mr.  President and
members, like I said, this would
be probably my,
my last
opportunity
to make a case before this body.
To think deeply,
to think deeply, not on this
vote. I know where this vote's going. But to
think deeply about
how we shape
energy policy
for the future.
We cannot,
there is no justifiable
way
to set up a
society
where we drive cars around
and turn lights on and power
our high energy way of
lifestyle to model that
on energy sparse
sources,
the return on the energy
or the return on the investment.
Let's say that's
a, a phrase that I think we're
all very
familiar with  Mr.  President.
Just think of it as an
investment,
the return on energy
utilizing energy sparse
sources for our high energy way of
life is awful. It
is absolutely
abysmal.
We don't see anything
in nature anywhere close to
this.
Please don't your don't let
yourself be fooled
by all of these
subsidies and
it's
supposedly cheaper
and all this other stuff. Just ask
people in Germany what's going
on right now or look at what's happening
to their
economy.
It is completely
unsustainable
and I understand we disagree on this,
but this is, this really is deeply
personal. You know, when
you're, when you're a dad,
when you're a mom, and you're
thinking, how are we
gonna steward the land for our
Children?
And you see a group
of people that in my mind
are making very fears,
decisions.
It's difficult.
And so my, my goal tonight
in sharing that I realize maybe
you think, wow, this is kind of a
bizarre,
but part of that is intentional
because I'm trying to create
some sort of memorable
analogy or story to
get people thinking a little
bit more because we're
not thinking
this more resembles an
animistic religious belief.
To me, a fear
based animistic religion
than rational
scientific
thought,
including the rejection of the Last
Amendment. There's absolutely no reason
to reject
that.
And so I have, I have no doubt
the, the sincerity
on the other side and some of the
advocacy groups behind this
bill,
but I just encourage you to just go
a little bit deeper
and to try to,
to really think,
hey, are
we,
are we really headed the right
direction here?
Are we really getting a better
return on
energy
or are we headed toward a
path that is going
to be so inefficient
that it will ultimately
not only destroy us
economically
but actually destroy
but the, the actual
planet itself.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Thank you Senator Sms.
We do have a Floor
amendment
reader to
read,
excuse me,
Senate Floor Amendment
number two to House
Judiciary committee. Substitute
for House Bill 41
amendment sponsored by
Senator Ron
Griggs. Senator
Griggs to move and explain the
amendment. Senator Griggs,
thank you, Mister President, I
move Senate or
House Judiciary
Committee. Substitute
for House Bill
41.
Senator Griggs. If you move the
floor amendment number two,
please,
if you move Senate
floor amendment number two to that
bill,
mister President, I
move house
Judiciary Committee
substitute for
House Bill
41.
I
move Senate Floor
Amendment and we'll get
there, we'll get there. I
move for a minute. The
House Judiciary
committee substitute
for House Bill 41.
Thank you, Senator Griggs. Senator Griggs has
moved for Senate Floor Amendment number
two. If you'll
explain what the amendment does,
Senator. Thank
you,  Mr.
President.
This is, this is
similar to some stuff we talked
about the, the other day.
Uh, as we, as we look
at some of this, some of the
information in the fir
talking about some of
the, um, some of the
places where we have
large amounts of ground
level ozone. Two
of those places are Bern Leo
County and Doanna
County.
Most of the states not
Bernalillo County or Doanna
County.
The
bill
as as
presented is
dealing with the entire
state.
I believe  Mr.  President
and, and members of the body,
if we look
at what this bill
does, which the bill
says that or the
amendment says
only,
uh, only class a
counties with the population
above 100 and
35,000
population
will be subject to
the bill.
However, if
a county that is less than
that chooses
to opt in
to this particular
law, they
may do so.
So
Mr.   Mr.  President, members
of the body, that's the amendment
in a nutshell. And with that, I'll
stand for questions.
Thank you, Senator Greg Sanders. We're
debating Senate floor amendment number two
and I'll yield to the sponsor,
Senator Stewart.
Thank you, Mister President.
So this amendment
is not friendly.
Certainly our rural
counties, Lee
Edie Chavis, Valencia,
San Juan. They need
these reductions.
Many of them
are
over the federal
listing of these
particulates or their
ground level
ozone ozone
is rising here in these
counties.
But even more
than that is that
many of these
uh new
clean fuel standard
companies uh
are from
rural areas. I'm
just looking at Bio Valley
Bi uh Rio Valley
Biofuels.
Uh This guy who
totally supports what we're
doing, uh produces
an impressive 17 million
gallons of biofuels
annually and he
relies primarily on
cooking oil
as its
feedstock.
Uh So we have
lots of areas
in the state where
we could really use
uh bio
feed stock, uh,
cow
manure,
uh etcetera
and the
counties where,
um, they have,
they are
over. The
federal government
is Bernia Dona
Ana Edie
Sandoval, San Juan,
Santa Fe and Valencia.
So this is a
unfriendly
amendment and would
undermine the great
rural and
tribal
economies that we
could enhance through
this bill. Thank you,
Senator Stewart Senators. We debating
Senator Floor amendment number
two, Senator
Woods
debate.
Um, I guess I
misunderstood your amendment.
Senator,
did you say that you would
outlaw any of
these fine
industries that's supposed
to do all this great
work in
rural New Mexico?
Are you just saying that you're
applying the rules
to the carbon
emissions
to the populated
areas? Did I
misunderstand something
here, mister President and Senator.
Thank you, Senator Woods. Senator
Griggs Yield, mister
President, Senator
Woods. No, you
didn't.
The, the
amendment will make the
law applicable solely
to the higher
populated areas
in the state.
Thank you, Senator Griggs. Senator
Woods. Well, that's
certainly, I
bet you, if you could
measure
accurately,
that would be most definitely
where the most co two was
coming from.
Uh, these very
populated areas. That's where
the most traffic is.
That's where the most asphalt
is that bleeds
up
of different
gasses.
Uh, but I
still think
if someone wanted to
establish a
commercial
clean fuel
operation
somewhere, they
could do that anywhere in the
state and that would not have any
effect
on your
amendment.
So, uh, maybe I
misunderstood the,
the sponsor of the original
bill did, did, uh,
if, if the original
sponsor, would you?
Thank you, Senator Woods. Senator
Stewart Yield.
Yes, Senator
Woods. Ok,  Mr.
President and madam
sponsor madam pro
TEM, tell
me
why
a clean fuels
operator, uh, someone
manufacturing clean
fuels
one, they couldn't operate
in the urban
areas or the rural areas,
in particular, the rural
areas
and still stay out
from underneath this
statewide
rule. I
mean, that has nothing to
do with emissions
that's bill and
fuel
and, and you're talking about
emissions and the most
emissions.
A marier
is in the
very populous area
of the state,
mostly the real Grand
Corridor that you
named.
Uh, so
am I missing something here,
Mr.  President and madam
Pro Tim. Thank you,
Senator Woods, Senator
Stewart
Mister President.
This is an unfriendly
amendment because it just
puts this program into
Albuquerque. Essentially,
it's the rural areas
that can benefit the most from
this. And
we do have counties
where ozone is rising.
Lee Edie
Chavis, Valencia, San
Juan. Uh
So rural
areas would not
benefit from
the pollution reductions
that is coming from
this bill and these
companies and these companies,
one of them said to
me he already has a building in
Clovis, uh just
passed this so we can get here
and make these fuels.
Uh So this is, it's
an economic benefit
but more than that
even it's a health
benefit for our
rural communities
and it's really not fair to
them. If they can't take part
in this program, that's
going to improve their health
and improve the economy of their
area. Thank you, Senator
Stewart, Senator Woods.
Thank you, Mister
President. I
see that the
pro TEM has
named about 1/4 of the
state that
needs this really
bad,
but I see 3/4 of the
state that don't need
it. So I'm
having trouble following
the logic, but
I will stand
for,
for the discussion.
Maybe I can get it after a
while. Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Thank you, Senator. Was,
we are debating Senate floor amendment
number two and I'll yield
to minority
floor leader, Senator
Baca.
Thank you,  Mr.  President with the
sponsor of the bill
yield. Senator Stewart Day
yield.
Yes, Senator
Baca, thank you, Mister
President. I thought I heard
you list off
some counties that it
would not apply to our
areas. Just
for example, would you
list those again, Mister
President? Thank you, Senator
Baca Center Stewart,
Mister President. We have an
amendment before us.
That amendment would
eliminate this program
anywhere except for
Albuquerque. That's
what I was responding
to. Thank you,
Senator Stewart, Senator Baca. Yes.
Thank you for the explanation.  Mr.
President. I understood that
part of the question
was what
counties did you
name? And so
I'll, I'll leave it at that,
but I think I heard you name
Valencia County,  Mr.
President. And, and so,
you know, it's kind of strange. I
live in Valencia County
and, and, uh,
Senator Woods lives out
on the east over there
and, and that, that
fact is really telling
to me,  Mr.  President that this
would not,
this, this should not
affect three quarters of the
state. Um, the, the
sponsor of this bill,  Mr.
President, it hurt the
home, the hometown there is
Bern Leo County in Albuquerque.
Um, and you know, if that,
if that district wants to
represent itself that way, I
think that's just fine.
But um Senator
Griggs um
Bill that or amendment
that he's putting forward makes perfect
sense to me. Again. This is another
example,  Mr.  President
of urban,
reaching out to rural,
to dictate policy
across the whole
state. Um
They can cite benefits
all they want. And if they believe
that  Mr.  President, I think
that's just great,
then apply it to where
you are, where you
live, I can tell you
and, and it was, it was really
laughable earlier.
Um listening to one of the
experts uh
in on this very bill
say,
well, you can't, you can't
really see what's in the air
that's polluting and is
harming our bodies. No, you
can. And I'm
not gonna leave my eyes
alone. I drive into
Valencia from Valencia County
into Albuquerque and
guess what? It's quite noticeable
when you drive into Albuquerque,
there is a, you know, a
darker cloud over
there for my clean, pure
skies just 30
miles south.
And so this makes perfect sense
to me. Let's use
common sense,  Mr.  President
in this chamber and
believe our eyes, one of our
senses, not
this voodoo science
that's being produced for us
telling us that we have dirty
air in this state in
a populace of only 2 million
people that were somehow
contributing to this
uh global
catastrophe. That's,
that's being pushed on us.
That's a real fearmongering,
Mr.  President. And
so I, I urge a body to
support this. Um
Let's, let's do it at a local
level. I, I think
that that would make perfect
sense to most people in this
state. Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Thank you, Senator Baker. We do have further
debate on the amendment. We have
Senator
Gallegos,
Mr.  President. Thank you
with the
sponsor, the amendment yield
for just a couple of questions.
Senator rigs
yield. I will
yield.
Sego.
Thank you,  Mr.  President, Senator. I, I
guess I'm, I'm trying to
understand, uh
we've talked about
Burn Leo and
Albuquerque
plus just
now. Um
Belan, but if
I understand I'm reading
your context
of your bill under item two
counties seat. Like to
participate in the clean
transportation fuel
standard program by entering
into an opt-in
agreement with
the department that gives
them the, the
option on that.  Mr.  President,
Senator. Is that correct?
Thank you, Senator Gallego, Senator
Griggs,  Mr.  President,
Senator. Yes, she
did,
Senator Gaos. So mister
President Senator. So if Rio
Riba decided
they wanted in,
then they would just apply to
be a participant. Is that
right? Mister President,
Senator Senator
Griggs, mister
President and, and Senator,
they would, the program I
believe sets up and the
bill sets up an EIB board
and they would apply with them
and, and that,
that would be the process,
they'd have to develop the
actual particulars,
but that would be the
process.
Senator Gaos.
Thank you for that  Mr.  President Senator.
So that EIB
board when they reached out
to or Leake County reached
out to them, they would be
able to go ahead and uh,
apply
and participate in this
if they wanted to. Is that correct,
Mr.  President Senator? Thank you,
Senator Gallegos. Senator
Griggs.  Mr.
President Senator. Yes, they
would.
Well,  Mr.  President Center, I guess
I like the idea, uh,
earlier in the
legislature, we're talking about
a lot of bills
that were school related and they
wanted it to be
local control.
Would you,  Mr.  President? Senator
think this is local
control? Thank you,
Senator Ggo, Senator
Griggs, Mister
President and, and Senator.
Yes, I, yes, I
would.
Well,  Mr.  President Senator,
then I see every
reason for me to go
ahead and stand
with you and vote for your
amendment because I
think this whole
state is
tired of metro
telling rural what to do
and this gives the
option
of the rural counties to be
a participant. So
I yield and I thank
you for your amendment.
Thank you, Senator
Gallegos
seeing no further debate on
the amendment. Senator
Griggs to close on the
amendment.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
And you know, we're
having, we're having different
debates every so often on this
bill. We think that
that the cost
at the pump is going to be
higher if
this bill is enacted.
And, and the sponsor
mentioned earlier
that
at least the sponsor doesn't believe
that's the case.
This
approach actually
allows us to
see whether or
not that would be the case
statewide as far as the
costs
go.
Mr.  President and, and
members, we talked a little bit
earlier about
the ground level
ozone in certain
counties. But what this
bill actually deals
with is
greenhouse gas emissions
from
transportation
and greenhouse gas from
transportation in New
Mexico is
a tribute. I mean, it's, it's
14%.
So mister
President,
where would that
be
from? Transportation?
It's in the populated
centres. It's in the Rio Grande
Corridor, it's in
Donan
Bernalillo and
Santa Fe counties.
I mean, that's where it is.
So when we look at
the remainder of the
state, the
remainder of the state doesn't
have that same
level
of, of
greenhouse gas emissions.
So  Mr.  President, I think that
this bill or this
amendment
is a perfect complement
to the bill. Not
only does
it
focus on the areas
that could be
problematic,
it gives other
counties the option
to opt-in
if they believe
that it's a challenge for their
counties. So, Mister
President with that,
I move
Senate floor amendment
number two, the house
judiciary committee
substitute to
house Bill 41
and I move that it do now
pass and I ask unanimous
consent of the Senate
that the records show that the role
has been called and all
those present voted
in the affirmative except those
voting in the negative by a
show of hands. Thank you, Senator
Griggs Senators. We're voting on the Senate floor
amendment number two. Senator
Griggs has requested by a show of
hands. If
you,
there's been a request for a roll
call. The
clerk to call the
roll.

the affirmative 24 in the negative
senate floor. Amendment. Number two
has failed to pass the Senate.
Senator Griggs.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Members of
the body. And I, I think if we
looked at that vote, we might
see a, a urban,
rural divide in that
vote. So thank you,  Mr.  President.
Thank you, Senator
Griggs.
We do have, we're back on the
bill. I'll yell
to Senator mccutcheon and
Senator Nibert and Senator Sheriff,
Senator
mccutcheon.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Would the
sponsor of the bill please yield.
Thank you, Senator Stewart
D yield. Yes, I
do
check.
Thank you,  Mr.  President
and Senator Stewart.
Um So in, in
looking at
what we're asking the
Environment Department to
do, I'm gonna go to
page eight
of the bill under
subsection three.
And so it looks like we're asking the
Environment Department to establish
technology neutral
mechanisms for
generating,
obtaining
trading, selling
reti and retiring
credits among transportation
fuel producers.
So, so let me just make sure I
have this right, Senator
Stewart. But what we're
doing is creating
fuel
carbon credits. Would that
be correct?
Madam Pro TEM Stewart,
please, Mister
President, Senator,
what we're doing here
is setting in place
with the advisory
board. The advisory
board is going to have
industry
producers
on it. We are
setting the
carbon
neutral mechanism
that we were
saying the carbon intensity
mechanism
so that people know
when they're
generating credits
because they're
below that
carbon intensity.
And if you're above it,
then you need to buy credit.
So this is the beginning, this
whole section here, page
eight and nine is the
mechanism to set in
place those
carbon intensity
measures,
Mister President and Senator.
So what eight and nine
are essentially doing are establishing
the metrics
through which we can
measure the carbon
produced or credited.
Is that correct? Senator Stewart,
please? So, Mister President
sort of not yet.
I mean, this sets up the
mechanism to do
that. It doesn't put it in
the bill, but I
think we're talking
about the same thing,
Senator mccutchen.
Thank you,  Mr.
President and
uh
Senator Stewart there.
So it looks like
under subsection six,
it says consider similar programs
in, in other jurisdictions
for coordinations with other
jurisdictions to promote regional
reductions in greenhouse gas
emissions, allow market
participants to generate
credits under
any overlapping current
and federal transportation
fuel.
As we go as
we go up,
we read in section
five require
participating utilities to
invest revenue
from the sale of credit.
So we are, in fact,
I mean, maybe not
exactly in this
bill explicitly, but we
are
setting up a mechanism
through which we can trade credits,
correct.
So, Mister President,
yes, I mean, it doesn't
set it up in here, but we're setting
up the mechanisms by
which we create
those
Senator mccutchen
Mister President and, and Senator, thank
you. So we,
we are going
to have the E I
or the Environment
Department set
up that mechanism and it's, and
it actually states in the bill that they're going
to operate that
mechanism. What is, what are the
measurements that are going
to be used as far
as
uh the
carbon, you know how we're
measuring carbon and, and things
like that, madam Pro
Temp Stewart, please.
So, Mister President,
the general idea
is that we start with the
2018
emissions and
we get 20%
lower than that by
2030
we get 30%
lower than that 2018
by 2040.
Uh Exactly
what that credit will look
like what it
will sell
or buy,
buy um is
not determined yet. It
will be determined through this
mechanism. Senator
mccutcheon, thank you, President
madam prom. So
we are, we are establishing
these things. Are, can we speak
about these credits
in if we
speak about them in metric tons?
Is that, would that be
um
describable sufficiently?
I guess
Mister President, if you look at
the very first page of the
bill where it
defines
carbon intensity, carbon
intensity means the quantity
of fuel, lifecycle,
greenhouse gas emission
per unit of fuel,
energy expressed
in grams of carbon
dioxide equivalent per
mega joule. So
that's a fancy
way of saying that we're going to
use the best science
we're going to use
several measures
that the federal government
has put in place
to the carbon
intensity
mister President Madam Pro TEM. Thank you.
That's
as I understood in committee
due to the Greek program
greet
and so they
measure everything in grams of
carbon dioxide equivalent per mega
joule. So there's been a
whole lot of buzz around what this is
actually going to cost
and seeing as how we
are
uh
giving authority to the
EIB or the environmental,
the Environment Department
to create carbon
credits. Those
are typically traded
in a few different locations
around the United States in
tons or metric
tons. And so
with that,
if we're looking at
grams, then we know
that 1 million g
equals a metric ton. And I
just kind of want to walk the body
through
how how people
are coming up with what
this is actually going to
cost.
Ok. So if we have a
million metric or
excuse me, if we have a million
grams, which is one metric
ton and we
look at how
many grams
are produced
by one gallon
of gas,
that is 8800
and 87
g super
riveting for
nine o'clock at night.
Um This this math
is so,
so if we have that is,
is is that correct
to y'all's knowledge
there, madam madam
pro TEM madam Pro
TEM
Stewart,
Mr.  President, the calculation
is correct.
Ok. Thank you  Mr.  President
madam Pro TEM. So
if we have 8, 8800
and 87 g
into one metric ton. You divide
that out. That's that. And
again, that, that
8800 and 87 represent
one gallon of gasoline.
That one gallon of
gasoline,
excuse me, 112
gallons of gasoline get us to
one metric ton
and one metric ton is going to be
the measurement that we, that
we use in a roundabout
way since we're
speaking English and we don't use a metric
system here in the United
States
except for certain
unpopular sports like
swimming and
things like that.
Um
So as we're,
as we're uh
uh a as
we look at this, let's go ahead and sign
a value to this.
So it has been stated that we're gonna, we're,
we're going to increase
by
20%
the carbon emissions
by I think it was, was it
2030? Is that, is that
was out in there, madam
Protean  Mr.  President
2018,
Mister President madam
Approach 2018 is the baseline
for what we're using. We're
going to decrease carbon
emissions by
20% by
what year?
So Mister President
2018 is the base
year, 20% by
2030 another
10% by
2040.
So 30%
overall in
2020
years.
Ok. Thank you. Thank you
very much. So, just
to do a little quick math,
we have established,
we have established
what things are going to cost
or, or exactly how many
tons are in how
many gallons of gasoline
produce are produced
in a ton and this isn't
using alternative
fuels or anything like that. We'll talk about
those in just a second here.
But
so
if
we look
at what a carbon
credit generally goes
for, it's between
somewhere between 104
$100. And depending on if you're
talking about British Columbia, if
you're talking about,
uh, California or
Oregon or, or those places that have
passed this. So for
round numbers, we're just
gonna use $200.
Ok. So we have
$200
divided by
100 and
12,
112 gallons,
gives us a dollar and 78
cents per gallon.
Now, if we're going to multiply that out
and say, hey, we're just going to cut that by
20% then
by 20% we're
looking at about 35
cents. So at
35 cents
per gallon
or if we are
using the target of
30% it's
54 cents
per gallon.
That is
what the carbon credits
will trade for. Madam
madam Pro TEM and Mister
President. Is that more
or less? Correct? On the
math. Temporary Stewart,
please, Mister
President. We don't know
that yet.
It's not just
this kind of academic
lesson. You can't do that because
you have to look at
uh the carbon
intensity and the
work that this advisory
council is going to do
with the Environment Department.
Eib. So
we're not, we're not ready
to say yes to your
data because
our data is a little
different.
Senator Senator
mccutchen,
Mister President
and madam Proem.
How, how
little different is our
data?
Yes. So Mister President, you're,
you're assuming that the cost
of a clean fuel
credit
relates to the price of
gasoline that never happens.
It doesn't happen in any of the
states that do
this. It just doesn't
work like
that.
Mr.  President madam Pro TEM,
thank you very
much for
that.
So these companies
are they going to be able
to purchase
carbon credits in offsets
or I guess, walk me through a little bit
of how it's actually going to work
because we said we have new companies are going
to set up in Clovis. They're
going to produce
clean fuels.
Probably the reason that they're
going to do that over there is for
biodiesel, you know,
and algae or something like
that or corn, potentially,
I guess. But
can you tell me what
is the baseline fuel
to be zero? I'll just
be pretty specific, the
baseline fuel
for a, a an
equal
carbon credit or
the fuel that would require to
have credits purchased
to
them.
Mister President just can't,
can't answer that.
Question. You
know, I will say that you're, you're,
you're switching off with
offsets and credits.
We're not talking offsets in
here. We're talking
credits that you
get when
you prove that
you have the
carbon intensity
of the fuel that you
are.
And if you lower it,
then you can sell
credits to others. If
you don't get to that
lower level,
then you have to buy credits
from other people to
sell your
transportation
fuel in New
Mexico. Senator
mccutchen, Mister
President madam Pro TEM, from
whom would I buy those
credits?
Mr.  President? I I
mentioned 20 companies
that want to come here. I've got
another 20 here.
We certainly had
Chevron and
Exxon stand up
in favour of this
along with
multiple people. They want
to come here and
produce lower
carbon fuel.
That's their
business
right now. They're producing
it in Texas and sending it
directly to California
because California
is the closest state with the
clean fuels
standard system.
So they
will sell their fuel
to anybody. Transportation, fuel,
everybody buys transportation
fuels.
Senator mccutchen, please.
Thank you,
Mister President and madam
Pro TEM. Would it be
possible for me to buy credits
from say Senator Woods during
peak growing time as
he
is
offsetting a lot of carbon
with on his
farms,
madam temp mister
President, if he's producing
clean fuel
and it's getting credits off
of that. Sure.
He looks ready to
start.
I,
we appreciate uh  Mr.
President and, and madam proin,
we do appreciate Senator Woods and
his good humour, especially at this late
hour.
Ok. So
I, I, I'm having a little trouble nailing
down a cost.
Um, but we
can look at
what has happened in
other states and,
and, and I'll give,
um, you know, I want to be 100%
factual here. I know that,
you know, in California
there's
lower,
um,
refining capacity that's
due to regulation as
well.
But uh Oregon
has repeated
um, after they passed
their clean fuels
and I forget the year that Oregon passed
their clean fuels, I guess Oregon
did it.
Um,
I don't have that. I don't have that written
down. I apologize. Oh, no. Here
we go. Oregon in
2009. Since
2009 they have seen a steady
increase and it hasn't been the
large increase here that I have,
but every year they
have had an increase
and they actually have in their,
in their bill that they need to
reconcile and they
have a formula that they
use when they are
reconciling that formula and
doing calculations and
showing the people what it costs
them.
So, you know, they've
come up and it's been, it's been, it's
been nominal. It has,
but they actually have a
cost assigned to it
and, and when they
assign that cost,
they don't actually,
um, figure straight
petroleum. They, they
figure some of the,
some of the uh clean fuels,
you know, like the 85 ethanol and things
like that and some
biodiesel, but
they are seen,
uh, a, a multiple
every year. Uh,
it was, you know, it was about a
quarter, it was about, it was about a
quarter. A gallon is all, it was the
first few years. Then it, then it,
then we, or excuse
me, it was, uh,
0.23
the first year it tripled after
that in 2018. It was,
it was about a penny a gallon. Then
it goes up to 2.5 cents.
Now it's 3.715
cents and now we're up to seven
cents in 2020 two.
And as the program goes
along, you know, it,
it doesn't look like that, it
decreases, but that it
just keeps going in the trajectory
is, is much
more, is much more
expensive. And this
does have factored in, factored
in there. A lot of, a
lot of subsidies. And
so this is not 100%
accurate data. It said
that you can add somewhere around 20
cents most likely to, to
most of these figures.
So, as we are
looking at this and, and just
because I've kind of got a, a
simple mind here, I'll just look at New
Mexico to New Mexico
today.
Fuel is
$2.95
and that's what, and that's, and that's
what we're paying.
Uh, currently
today,
if we look at
Oregon, Oregon is paying
$3.50 a
gallon. If we look
at Washington, Washington's
390 then we get to
California and
California is paying
462.
And I don't know about you.
Um, madam Pro
Tim and President,
but the people in my
district cannot
afford another
dollar 67
on their fuel. And
that's where I'm afraid we're going. I don't think
that we'll get there for years according to this
data that we have for Oregon,
we're not gonna get there for
years. But if we
pass this bill,  Mr.
President Madam Proo,
if we pass this bill,
we are not passing this
bill like we
did with,
uh, like we did
with paid family medical, even putting the
burden on companies.
A matter of fact, as was
stated earlier, we
have oxy petroleum,
we have Exxon, we have
Eog, we have Chevron,
we have those companies that have come out
and spoke in favour of this
and why, why?
Because they know
that they have a new market,
they have a new product that they'll
be able to sell. And they
pass that along
through these carbon credits
and trading, they're
not gonna be hurt. They're gonna
have, they're gonna have a new market. It's gonna be
great. So we are
gonna saddle
the people in our districts,
our constituents that
are living paycheck to paycheck
and going to work every day and sending their
hard earned money to Santa Fe so we can come
squander it like a bunch
of losers
and we're going to saddle this and put
that on their back. They're
the ones paying for it because
Chevron Oxy
exxonmobil, they
are the ones that are going to benefit
from it. And the people in my
district are going to suffer
with fuel that costs
potentially 50
60 70 80 cents a gallon
more. And I'm not trying to fear monger,
but I've run you through the math
and that's where we're at and
I refuse to be able to, I refuse
to support this. I,
I wish that
the other members of the body
would listen to who's
benefiting and that is
big oil and who's
losing. And that is
the, that is the woman just
trying to take her kids to
soccer. That's the dad
that's trying to sit there at
the, at the kitchen
table, balance a checkbook
and try to figure out how to make his mortgage
payment. That's who we're
hurting with this. This will be a
direct tax on them
and I refuse my
support,
Mr.  President. Thank you.
Thank you very much, Senator
mccutcheon. We're moving
along. We're going to
Senator.
Oh, let's see. How about
Senator
Nibert?
Senator Nibert, please.
Thank you,  Mr.
President.
Will madam pro
TEM yield. Madam
wrote Trey Stewart. Do you
yield? Sure.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Um,
my colleague,
uh Senator
mccutcheon went through some
calculations and here in a
second, I'll have
a few others. Uh
based on some
experiences in Canada.
But before we go
there,
um,
if I understand the
bill correctly,
um,
you stated
that the
person that
is selling
the
carbon
intense fuel,
the carbon intense
transportation fuel,
they're going to have to go to
a market to purchase
credits. Did I
understand that
correctly?
Senator Stewart Mister
President?
I don't think so.
So if
you're, if you're developing
oil, if you're producing
oil, not oil,
transportation,
fuel
and you
have lowered
the carbon intensity
on that transportation
fuel enough,
so that you're making
the standards that we've
set, then you
can offer
credits to other people
who are not doing that.
So you won't be able
to sell, uh,
transportation
fuel in New Mexico.
Unless you're trying
to lower the carbon, you
can lower that carbon
intensity multiple
ways. One of them
is to buy credits
from someone who is doing
that
and  Mr.  President.
So, so
one way to
continue to sell
gasoline or diesel in New
Mexico would be to
purchase
credits
to then
sell that product within
the state of New Mexico.
Was, is that
correct? I thought that's
what you just said,
Tim Stewart,
please. Uh  Mr.
President. Well, we're probably selling
the same thing saying the
same thing but
you, you, you don't,
you sell credits only
if you have lower carbon
intensity
and you buy them only if
you have high.
Yeah. And if
you're selling the product
being gasoline
or
diesel
in order to sell
gasoline or diesel
that is
unadulterated. If
you will, it doesn't
have the
additives that you're
desiring that
party has
to then
pay
to secure these
credits that offset
their high
or carbon intense
transportation fuel. Do
they not  Mr.
President? Yeah, you have to buy
credits if you're not lowering
the intensity
and, and
Mr.  President
and, and
madam pro TEM,
so
the
market that would
exist
for this,
purchasing these credits
that may be necessary for
some
sellers of
transportation
fuel. Does
that market currently
exist in New
Mexico?
Uh  Mr.  President, we already
have some uh companies
that are producing
um biogas.
Uh There's one in
Deming. Um So
there are a few companies
that are trying to produce lower
carbon intensity
transportation fuel
already here
and  Mr.  President and,
and madam Broin that
there's a substantial
investment in Artesia New
Mexico with respect to
biodiesel. Uh
In fact, we're seeing
an uptick in train
traffic through
my community as a
result of
uh of that activity, they're
shipping in
uh
I guess
plant-based
uh
oil if you will
and uh blending it
with diesel and then they're shipping
that uh so-called
biodiesel out of
New Mexico. So, so
it's being done even
in my backyard. But
um I, I'm
concerned about these credits
because we just uh
considered a
bill
that would
have,
I think presented
tremendous opportunities
to, to develop
that market in New Mexico
and to have a New
Mexico market.
Um And, and
so you mentioned
uh some of the companies
that, that might
benefit from this and,
and again, it's
the, the
largest of the large
and, and
I, I understand why they're
getting into this, but
I'm, I'm not sure that New
Mexico necessarily
benefits from it.
Um
with respect
to
gasoline and
diesel prices, you, you
mentioned that there should be no,
no price increase.
But I'd like to
look at a study that was
done for the Canadian
Parliament. Not
a study. You don't
have to take my words or,
or, you know, uh
some
oil and gas companies
reserves uh
words for
it. But the Canadian
Parliament had a, had a
study commissioned
and I'll just read
uh a couple of things
here in that study
and here's the key
result of that study.
It says the ECCC
and I don't know what that is, but
it estimates that
the clean
fuel
regulations
will increase the price of
gasoline and diesel
in 2030 the
year in which the clean
fuel regulations
reach fu fuel
full
stringency
by up to 17 cents
per liter and
16 cents per liter
respectively.
Um
So I I went
through uh
that and,
and here's some
calculations as
to what
Canada
estimated the cost
of gasoline and
diesel uh is
going to increase
as a result of
Canadian clean
fuel
regulations
if you have uh
16 or
17 cents and we'll, I'll
give you the numbers for those,
but there's
a 3.785
L per gallon.
So
16 cents
times
3.785
equals
60.56
cents.
Canadian.
If you take
60.56
cents,
Canadian
multiply it, by
the exchange rate, you
come up with
81.34
cents for us.
Dollar.
If you use 17
cents,
it's
64.375
cents. Canadian
which equals
86.42
cents in the United
States. That's what
the report to the Canadian
parliament reflected
is going to happen in
Canada when they have
their
30%
reduction
as a result of,
of their
regulations.
And so
based on
that, I
mean, we, we can throw a lot
of numbers here, but based on that,
it appears that Canada
recognizes
that its clean fuel
regulations are going
to result
in the increase
in diesel prices in
gasoline prices
uh up
there which would
equate about 81
to 86 cents
in the US. Uh
So I
am concerned about the
impact. I am concerned
about what this
bill is going to
do to
the price of
transportation, fuel
in New Mexico
and who it's going to impact.
And I would submit to
you that
the greatest
impact
is going to be
those at the, at the
lower economic
straddle.
This is a regressive
tax and it's
going to be felt the harshest
by those who
have the least, those
that can least
afford um,
these transportation
fuels. If you
look at, um,
I, I'd like to look
at the word transportation,
fuel for a
second.
It's defined as being
for the purpose of transportation.
So my question,  Mr.
President and
madam prom
is,
if a farmer
is purchasing
diesel
or gasoline
for purposes
of running
machinery on the
farm,
are they going to be
exempt from having
to pay whatever
increase as a result
because they're not using
that fuel for
transportation?
So  Mr.
President in
all of the states
that have this now,
they have not seen
a gas price
increase because
of the clean fuel standards.
So gas prices are a
function of many
things, crude
oil, uh
excise taxes,
sales taxes, Oregon
has 40 cents
per gallon, sales tax
on gas. Uh I
think California's even
higher. We're at
17.
So it's
just not
accurate and true
to do this kind of
fearmongering.
We certainly have also
put in the bill
on page nine,
maximize savings
and limit consumer costs.
We have a good
solid advisory
counsel. We have one
of the best agencies
in the state
between E I
and New Mexico Department
and they're going to work with stakeholders.
We want to contain costs.
I don't want to increase gas
prices. I
just go
back to what I took
off the internet two years
ago. This is
Los Angeles
for regular
gas. It's
$4.79
for clean fuel. It's
$3.19.
That's a dollar 60
less per
gallon.
So we certainly have
uh renewable diesel.
Now, we have several
companies that are, are
producing renewable
diesel. Uh So those
farmers are going to be
able to take
advantage of that. The same
way other people will.
Senator, please,
Mr.
President and Madam
Proem. Was that
uh E 88 fuel
that's being advertised in
California,
Mister President. It's E
8585
and, and mister President and
madam Prot, do you know what
e 85
gasoline
is? Temporary
Stewart, please? No, I
don't.
It's uh  Mr.
President and, and madam
pro TEM, it's, it's
85%
methanol produced
from uh generally
corn or soybeans
or other uh
grain products.
Uh They, they blend
it with
uh a little bit of 15%
gasoline,
um
traditional gasoline, I
guess if you will a
and that is
a fuel uh
Mr.  President and, and
madam poem does
E 85 gasoline
have the same uh
power if
you will as
uh regular
unleaded
gasoline.
So Mister President, it probably
determines, you know, it depends
on what type of engine it's
going into how
you use
it.
Well,  Mr.  President madam
Pro TEM, I would submit to you
that, that uh
it does not have
the, the same uh
power if you
will. And so there may
be some other compromises
there with respect to
fuel mileage and
other things that 1
may need out of that
transportation fuel,
but it certainly does,
uh, uh allow
that. And I would
also submit  Mr.
President that
the, a
great reason
of why that's lower in
price is because of the
subsidies that the federal
government provides
to the, that
type of production
you need not go any further
than Iowa to find
out uh how
important that federal
subsidy is.
Um
with respect to
the
issue of whether or
not
the farmer
could be exempt
from
any increase cost.
Whether it's uh what
Canada says,
what uh the the
other calculations or
maybe it's just a penny,
but would farmers be
exempt from that because
they're not using
that fuel
as transportation fuel
as defined in the
bill.
Temporary Stewart,
please, Mister
President. This, you know, this applies
to the fuel, not the farmer,
it doesn't apply to the gas
stations. It's the
fuel itself, the transportation
fuel, the production
of it, the producing
it. That's why we have all these
companies and they're not big
Graham Noise, low-carbon
fuels Coalition Libert
Power Project, Richard
Mason, alternative fuels
developer, biotechnology
Innovation Organization,
Clean Energy Ryan
Kinney Renewable Energy
Group, Tom Turin
Naro Inc
Mesilla Valley
Transportation
Company, Rocky
Mountain Farmers
Union.
They all want to
build,
develop, produce
lower carbon
fuels.
And  Mr.  President
uh and Madam Proin, my,
my, again, my
concern is we're
looking at the fuel,
we're not, not looking at
the
use even
though it's the use
that's defined as transportation,
fuel, it's fuel
utilized for
transportation.
There's a lot of fuel that's
utilized in this state
that's not
utilized for transportation,
but yet it seems
that they are going to have
to bear whatever burden
is a result of, of this
legislation as well.
Um
Mr.  President madam
Pro TEM, I know
a few years ago we were
really interested in
securing
uh a fuelling
station
south of Las Cruces
on the New Mexico side of the
border for the
Union Pacific
Railroad. Could
you tell us,  Mr.  President
and Mantaro Tim,
what the impact this
legislation may be
on the Union
Pacific in
uh the Las Cruces
area. And I also
believe that uh the
Burlington Northern Santa
Fe railroad
BNSF
uh there's a lot of
refueling in Belin. So
could you talk about whether
or not there will be any impact
to, to those fuelling
stations for our railroad
temporary store, please.
So, Mister President, the impact
of this is
lowering carbon
intensity in the air
for the one in the seven
people in New Mexico that
have asthma or
respiratory problems.
Also, there's
plenty of communities,
communities you all seem to
care about that
live on these transportation
corridors where that
ground level
ozone is
impacting their ability
to breathe and the
health impacts,
you know, II I just
want to jump five years
into the future where we
all have cleaner
fuel, the carbon
is lower and
everybody buys that
fuel all over the
state because
it's for
everyone,
Mr.  President and
madam Pro
TEM with
respect to electricity.
How do we
calculate the
carbon intensity
of
electricity that may be
used?
And  Mr.  President that
will be determined through the
process set up through the
eib the New Mexico
Environment Department
rulemaking and
their advisory
committee that has
producers
and  Mr.
President and madam
pro TEM. Would that be
dependent upon
uh a moment
by moment uh
event or, or
would it be uh
just an average over
a longer period of time as
to the sources
of generation of those
electrons for
the electricity?
Uh  Mr.  President, this
is calculated on the
fuel life cycle
the definition
of that is on page two of the
bill D.
Ok.
Certainly. Uh,
you would agree with me,  Mr.
President madam pro TEM
that, uh that will be a
very difficult
exercise, uh,
to say the least
to, to try to figure out what
the carbon intensity
of electricity
is because it's gonna vary
by market. I
suspect within the
state of New Mexico
because they, the three
utilities plus the various
co ops uh
source their
uh generation electricity
from variety of means
which would have different
uh uh I
suspect different
carbon intensity.
Um
Madam or  Mr.
President Madam
Proem. Uh
I think that our
concern
and I know you, you
disagree with this,
but our concern is
that
this
legislation
will have
re uh will
have negative results
on the price
of gasoline in the
state. The prices
will go up as a result
of having to
purchase carbon
credits to
offset the carbon
intensity of the fuel that
is, is consumed
in the state.
And
you know, there's a reason
why there's a lot of e
85 in the
Midwest, but
you rarely see E
85 in
at least most of New
Mexico. It does
not exist in most of
New Mexico because of the
distance to those
markets. We used to
have a lot of
uh methanol
production in eastern New
Mexico, but all
of that Methanol production
went by the wayside
after the tax credits
were, were
uh gained and
and because we just
don't have the
quantity of grain
crops
to
make those types of
products. And so
the the
uh methanol
producers on the east
side of the state anyway,
uh have all
virtually disappeared.
So, you know, I think,
I think we're all concerned about
the impacts of this.
I think uh the
Canadian government
has uh done
some pretty good studies that
reflected what
their experience is, go
is and is going
to be and it all
results in higher prices
for the consumer.
And that is something
that I think the
citizens of New Mexico
do not need particularly
at this time. So for that,
I can't support the legislation.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Thank
you very much, Senator Nibert.
Next we go to
Senator Scher. Senator
Scher, please. Thank you,  Mr.
President.
All of this discussion
about
the poor health of New Mexicans
because of what's in our air
just really has me discombobulated.
I don't understand
it. We are
healthier
than we've been.
Well
prior to COVID, we
were healthier than we've been
in all of the history
of the
earth.
Part of our problem
is that we live longer
now. And
so things wear out that
didn't wear out when we died at
age 35 or
45.
But just listening to all of this,
Mr.  President,
I've come to the conclusion that what
we really need is a tax
credit so we can all buy body
condoms so we can be safe.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, Senator
Share. Next we go to
Senator Baca. Senator Baca,
please. Thank you,  Mr.
President. Uh I'm just gonna
pull this back a little bit. You
know. Um,
what, what are we, what are we
doing here
again?
Think just have common
sense. Ok.
Common sense gets us through
a lot in this world
where
in the world do
we take a
product,
put production
into it
and it becomes
cheaper.
When you pick an apple
and you turn it into apple
sauce, the apple sauce
is more expensive than the
apple.
When you take <AAA>
beef
and you process it and put
it on the shelves, it's more
expensive.
But I guess if we're talking
about fuel, that's not the
case.
Se Senators, please. We're
continuing with the debate.
Please proceed Senator
Baca.
So it's common sense.
I have an aluminum can here.
This is a mineral in the
ground
when you take it and you
turn it into this can
and you put it on the shelf
that aluminum is much
more expensive than when it's
unrefined. This is
what we're doing here,
but we're being told  Mr.
President
that if we do
this to fuel, it somehow
becomes
cheaper.
It's ridiculous.
It affects every single
person, every single
commodity in this
country. From the
car, you drive
to the soda, you drink
to the food you eat. When we
impact fuel
prices, we impact
everything.
It is ludicrous to
think that this cost is gonna
go down.
It is ludicrous and
it is cruel
because it impacts the
most impoverished in our
state. The people
struggling, that's
who's gonna feel
it.
We have all this
supposition going forward
about. It's going to create this
job and it's going to create that
job. And there's
no, that's just speculation.
We have nothing to base
that on. What I can
tell you is, is we
have a major refueling
operation in BLN New
Mexico where the
railroad fills the trains
and they have made a substantial
investment in that
city and we are happy
to have them there giving
us some of the highest paying
jobs in the
area.
So how are we gonna reward
them? We're gonna make
them pay more for their fuel.
I'm not gonna go through the detailed
mathematics. My colleagues
did great with that
and they brought me some more numbers
to present. I think New
Mexico just has to hear common
sense and
even more. I think they need common
sense from this
chamber.
They're not getting
it.
Mr.  President
New Mexico,
watch the vote
again.
I have been saying this this whole
session, watch the
vote and even more
carefully watch the
sponsors
who's doing these
things to this
state, who's
voting on these
propositions
to keep us poor. And I
disagree with
the good, the good Chair of Finance
earlier. He said, you know,
we're rich, be proud. I'd like
to do that. But what
he said is this state
is rich.
That is a keen distinction
because the state is
rich, the
individual is
impoverished
at the expense of
the wealth of this
state.
That's all
this is
the people that write
the checks that are funded
from oil and gas to these
entitlement programs
and things like this are what
keeping this state down
and we have to resist
that. Wake up New
Mexico,
November's coming
again. I make this, this
vow to everyone. I
will go back and I will
tell my constituents how I
voted on this bill.
And again, I
make my commitment to
everyone in this room
that I'm gonna visit yours
too. And I'm gonna tell them how
you voted because
everybody deserves that.
Mr.  President,
honesty,
integrity,
showing the people what
they're getting. Thank you,
Mr.  President. Thank you very
much, Senator
Baca. Any
other debate?
See, no further debate. I'm
going to the pro
tempore Senator Mimi
Stewart to close, please.
Close Senator.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
So
you know, it really does bother
me that we seem so
divided.
Um I'll just say
that I,
I think
we all care
about health. I
think we all care
about pollution.
It doesn't sound like we
do from this
conversation.
I think we all care
about infrastructure and that's
what this bill is
making our fuel
cleaner.
It's the second
highest
incidence of pollution in
the state is our transportation
sector. The first
being oil and
gas.
So according
to the other states,
and there's something that's
really
amazing that happened in
California because the
military bases, there are
part of their clean fuel
standard
and they've had a lot of success
with the participation of the
US military on clean
fuel standards. The
Navy in San
Diego has
worked with the port of San
Diego to ensure that
when ships are
tied up at the pier
there, they're using
renewable power whenever
possible. Since
2022 the
navy has generated
$4.5
million and they put
it in its own energy conservation
savings program.
So we have learned
from other states.
We have learned how to do
this better.
We've have learned how to
put a New Mexico spin
on it.
Um I I ask
the body to help
me to make
sure that we have in
low-income
communities aren't
paying too much for daily
needs, but their health care
is also taken care
of that. We lower
that carbon intensity
on those areas where
they live. We all
want cleaner air.
I believe that
I don't believe we want to subject
our families to respiratory
illnesses.
So this program
really does check it
all. It helps with
health, it helps with
the economic development
of our rural areas.
I've mentioned at least
40 companies who want to
come here. I
don't want them to develop
this and then truck it to
California, which is what they're
doing now.
So I ask the body to
help us be
innovative and
creative work
on health issues
all around our state.
With that mister President, I move
that the House judiciary committee
substitute for House Bill
41 do now
pass and I asked
for a roll call vote. Thank
you senators. We are voting
all senators to your seats, please.
We are voting. There's been a request for a

Yes,
by a vote of 26 in the
affirmative 15. The negative house
judiciary committee substitute
for House Bill. 41 has
passed the Senate. Senator
Munoz to explain his vote.
Thank you,  Mr.  President Bertie
came over from the house and told me that
Chevron and Exxon, we're going to buy
the plan outside of Gallup. So I'm
gonna kind of hold them to
that. They want a carbon
tax credit. So let's invest
in New Mexico.
Chevron and Exxon, you on
the line. Uh We're gonna
start looking at oil and gas
policy next year
and see what happens.
Uh, if we need to change oil
and gas rules and
regulations that will happen.
The other thing is tax
credits won't work anymore.
We've given them to the railroad
to Union Pacific, to all
those other tax
entities for fuel.
Those are gonna go away.
They can use their carbon tax
credits to offset the cost of
the fuel in New Mexico and we can bring
that money back into our
coffers. Number
three, if this really is gonna
create jobs in New
Mexico, the
big oil companies are now
on the line because
I will watch
and I will swing bills
and I will move bills through my
committee that could
have an effect if they don't live up
to the truth. Thank you.
Thank you. We have Senator Perle to explain
his vote. Thank
you,  Mr.  President. And after
the debate, I really don't,
I don't even know
what we were
debating.
There was half
truths,
misdirection.
I mean, we even use the word
fearmongering in a, in a debate
on, on fuel
and, and I just don't know what's,
what's become of this body
or, or what's become
of debate here.
Um When we can't even get real
answers to, to
real questions. And I, and I think
it's, it's very concerning.
Um you know, it makes me
think of a famous
Chris Farley quote.
Get a good look at a
bull's butt by sticking
your head up a t-bone or you can take the
butcher's word for it.
We do have a Senator
Scher to explain
his
vote.
Mr.  President, you're gonna have to give me a
second. You're
on the clock. Center
chair,
Mr.  President.
There, there was a comment
about ships moving
into San Diego. Uh
Mr.  President, aircraft
carriers, American aircraft carriers
have two giant nuclear
power plants on board
that generate something like
500 megawatts. So it's
1000 that's what San
Juan generating station
was and they
don't take power from San
Diego when they hook
up, they give power to
San Diego. So yes,
San Diego does get green
energy. It's called nuclear
power. Thank
you.
Thank you, Mister President
under resource
communities.
So California actually
carved out money to
develop and launch
projects
and they also
had that were aimed
at overcoming transportation
challenges faced by residents
in their communities.
So I do look forward
to seeing a little bit more
that it's going to address
those issues and
I hope I don't regret
supporting this
bill.
Thank you, Senator Pinto, Senator
Stewart.
Thank you, Senator
Majority Florida Peter. We take us
to the next order business. Thank
you,  Mr.  President. I can say we go
that our business announcements miscellaneous.
There is no objection. We're in that order.
Business announcements are
miscellaneous.
Mr.  President. I think the Senate
Finance Committee is going to head
upstairs to work on a bill
while we continue on our
calendar. So unanimous consent
to allow the Senate Finance Committee
to go upstairs and
work on the capital
outlay, Senator Pirtle,
there's been a unanimous consent request.
You good with it. See,
no objection.
We're gonna continue on to
Senator Wirth. We're still an announcement to
miscellaneous. Senator Wirth. Thank you,
Mr.  President. Uh, we've
got a committee report. We need to
do up there and
some messages from the unanimous.
Can't we go our business messages from the house
here? We know objection. We, that order of
business messages from the house. The
reader will read
Mister President. I'm directed
to inform the Senate that the House has

That's Senate Bill 271.
And since Senator Cervantes is
not here, Senator IBI
Soto will do that tonight. Uh
Then we'll do item number
five. That'll be House Bill
151 Senator
Jaramillo and we
will wrap it up with item
number six, which
will be Senator Schmid's
is my understanding
for his last bill.
With that  Mr.  President
Unanimous consent. We go without our business
third reading of legislation. I yield to
Senator Ivey Soto for item number
three, Senate Bill 271.
Senator Wirth. If we can stand
announcements miscellaneous. If you can keep
us on that, we have one announcement.
Yes. Correct. Let me, let
me unan well, we're
still there because we didn't take it. So let
me yield to Senator Bela because we just,
just what happens when you
roll the just everyone
watching, we've got to excuse
those that are not here again because it's a
new legislative day.
So,
thank you, Mister President. You have
consent to excuse Senators
Correa Hemphill
Duhigg
Cervantes.
And well, we've already
excused
the
thank you, Mister President. So
Un's consent to excuse Senator
Correa Hemphill Duhigg
Cervantes,
Padilla
Steinborn,
Gonzalez,
Rodriguez
and Munoz
until they return to the chamber except
for the purposes of a call. Thank you,
Senator Senator
Baca.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Unanimous
consent to excuse
the members of our finance committee.
Thank you, Senator Bo Cassin. No
objection.
Sorry with
Senator Peter Worth,
Mr.  President, except for purposes
of a
call
here. See,
no objection,
Senator Peor. Uh, thank
you,  Mr.  President. You haven't sent, we go
out of his third reading of legislation at
E dot Senator Aviso for
item number three Senate Bill
271. See, no
objection. We're in that order of business.
Senator IVIS Soto to present the
bill. Thank you very
much, uh  Mr.  President.
And uh, before
I get to the bill, I, I do want to
appreciate uh Senator
Pt's comment on
the last bill. I think that was
for the Meat Inspection Act.
Um the,
uh, uh, in honour
of Senator
Cervantes's
um,
anniversary. I will present his
bill for him. Uh,
so  Mr.  President,
uh, I ask unanimous consent of the
Senate that the record show that all actions
for placing Senate judiciary committee
substitute for Senate Bill
271.
Um,
on final passage has been taken, it
is now subject to debate, amendment
or substitution. See no
objections. Senator AOTA, if you'll
explain the bill. Thank you very
much,  Mr.  President and  Mr.  President, I
will note that uh the board
still shows the emergency clause but the
committee substitute does not have the
emergency clause. We may
want to fix that up on the board
uh, since it's not in the committee
sub uh
the um,
so  Mr.  President and
colleagues, this bill
is a bill
that deals with repeat felony
offenders and all it does
is it just simply says
that a person who is a
repeat felony offender when they are not on
conditions of release has to
stay in custody
until every
judge on a prior
felony case has
not to review their conditions
of release because they violated
conditions of release for picking
up a new felony charge.
It also invites
the Supreme Court to write rules
to enact different parts
of this statute. With that
Mr.  President, on
behalf of Senator Cervantes would be happy
to stand for questions. Thank you. Senator,
the senators were debating Senate
judiciary committee, substitute
for Senate bill.
271
without emergency clause.
Senator
Nibert,
thank you,  Mr.  President.
Will the Senator
yield Senator Aviso
to do yield  Mr.  President? I'd be happy
to thank you, Senator
Ibert. Um,
Mr.  President, uh
and Senator,
it seems like
this bill of all
bills
needs an emergency clause
because of
the
impact that this,
um, that the former
cons or the
constitutional amendment
years ago has had
on New Mexico.
So my, my
question,  Mr.  President and
Senators,
why did we
take the emergency clause
off of this bill
when we see so many emergency
clauses on bills that don't
seem to be as important
as this to keep one on.
Thank you, Senator Nibert. Senator
Aviso. Thank you very
much,  Mr.  President, Senator
Nibert. The reason why the emergency clause was
removed is in deference
of separation of powers.
The emergency clause was removed
in order to give the Supreme Court the
opportunity to
draft and promulgate
rules in order to be able to
implement portions
of this statute.
But  Mr.  President
Senator,
as I understood your
argument in
committee,
this was not holding
them based on their new
crime. It was holding
them based on their
violation
of the conditions
of release
by which they
were set free in the
prior crime. Is that
not accurate? Thank
you, Senator Nibert, Senator Eot
mister President Senator Nber. That,
that is correct. That is why this is
constitutional.
However, the reason,
the reason why we want to
give deference to the Supreme Court in terms
of issuing rules is
because we want to be able to deal with
situations such as a person from
another jurisdiction. Uh
how it is that they do
multiple people, what
the time frames are to, to
ensure that there's a speedy
resolution to the uh
reviews,
etcetera.
Thank you, Senator
Senator.
But  Mr.  President, our
concern is the safety
of our communities
and if there ever was an
emergency, this is the bill
that needs the emergency
clause and I,
I don't know why
it was stripped out. I think
that, that this of
all bills we need
to act immediately and if
the court has to act quickly,
it can do so it
can pass rules very
quickly. But
this is a protection.
This is truly the
purpose of an emergency clause
to protect our
communities, to
protect the health, safety
and welfare of citizens
in our community. And so
I, again, I don't
understand why it was stripped out.
It seems to me that, um,
we ought to add it.
But, uh,  Mr.
President and Senator, I
appreciate your bringing
forth this bill.
It's been needed
and  Mr.
President, I don't
know if it was your idea,
Senator or, or
the chairman's idea,
but it's ingenious and
I congratulate whoever
came up with this
for their
ingenuity and addressing
that critical issue
that I think each of our
communities has faced for
the past eight or 10
years. Thank you,  Mr.
President. Thank you, Senator
Nibert. We have Senator Ortiz Pino,
followed by
Senator
Diabo.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. I just
wanted to follow up Senator
Nibert. It's comment we've,
we've heard several times
that this session
has not done anything about
crime but the,
the, the crucial issue
of crime in our state. And
this I think is a major
step toward
reducing the public's
concern
that people
are being released committing
crimes and nothing is happening to
them. This is a very good
way of doing that and I appreciate
the senator bringing this forward.
Thank you, Senator
Tinno,
Senator Morris. Thank you,  Mr.
President. Um, this is the
second crime bill we've had
tonight and as
a former legislator in the other
chamber said crime, crime,
crime all the time.
And it's, I find it ironic that
he's probably gonna be in federal prison.
Thank you,  Mr.
President.
See, no, for further
debate, Senator
I Risotto to close on the
bill. Thank you very much,  Mr.
President  Mr.  President. I move
that Senate judiciary committee substitute
for Senate Bills 271.
Do now pass and I see consent
of the Senate, the Senate that the
record show that
the ros be called all those president
vote in the affirmative except for those voting
in the negative by all senators to
your seats. Please. We are
voting
if you wish to vote. No, please raise
your
hand.
Senator mckenna voting.
No,
Senator mckenna, I got your
vote.
He said what I do that and
he said you
can
by vote of 27 in the
affirmative one in the
negative Senate
judiciary committee substitute for Senate
Bill 271
has passed the Senate. Senator
Iota. I'm glad we still have a quorum. Thank
you very much,  Mr.  President. Colleagues.
Thank you. We're gonna go on to the
next item that's going to be item
number five House Bill
151 and I'll
yield to Senator
Hil  Mr.
President. I ask unanimous consent
of the Senate that the record show that
all actions for placing
House Bill 151
and final passage have been
taken and that it's now subject
to debate, amendment or
substitution. No objection
Senator had. If you'll explain
the bill,  Mr.  President, there's a
public health crisis
occurring in our college
campuses. National
statistics show that one
in 10 students will be sexually
assaulted in college
with rates even higher among
students of intersecting
marginalized identities.
Sexual violence is more prevalent
in college than any
other crime. Now,  Mr.
President, what this bill does is
requires trauma informed
policies and responses
by post-secondary
edu educational
institutions
protect survivor survivors
and bystanders from punishment
if the school student code of conduct
was broken at or near
the incident of sexual
violence. It also provides
training for students in higher education
institutions on affirmative
consent.  Mr.  President.
This bill is about being
proactive versus
reactive as a former
educator. This is about teaching
students. There are no criminal
penalties associated with
this bill. This just
lets people know what the rules
are. Thank you,  Mr.
President. Thank you, Senator Jamil
Senators. We're debating House Bill
151. Senator
Pirtle  Mr.
President, I question the presence of
a
quorum.
Mm
Thank you, Senator
Pirtle
and
Senator Pinto. Would you do as
you speak? Senator
Pinto?
Right.
Thank you,  Mr.  President and
with the sponsor
yield.
Senator  Mr.
President, I yield. Thank
you,
Senator.
This part
are we assured that
there's no mechanisms
already in place
to
in statute that already do
this to
make sure that we
are,
that affirmative consent
is not
punishable. I don't know what you would
say.
Mister President, there is title
nine that's in place, but this is
another layer of
education.
So mister President
Senator, all we're doing is
educating them on
affirmative consent
policies,
Mister President Senator. That's
correct
policies and responses.
Senator and mister
President Senator
Hario,
why?
How come they're not
already
educating them on these
policies,
Mr.  President, this gets everyone
on the same page when it
comes to
consent
and, and I
don't need the Senator to
yield but just
some
comments
I did try to have
an affirmative consent
all the way around in the state
drafted. And they
told me, well, there's already mechanisms
in place in law that
it's not
necessary
when we talked about educating
our, you know,
post-secondary
institutions
in some instances. I feel
like they're not really
responding to our student
body and their
needs,
which I think this
should actually
develop in that way
because that shows that
initiative and the value
of the student and keeping
that
environment safe for
them.
But I appreciate the
senators.
So
bringing this forward
and I don't think
about the bill, but thank you,
Senator Harm. Thank you,
Senator Brittle. Thank
you,  Mr.  President. I question
the presence of a quorum senators.

legislation and I
yield to Senator Harlo
back on house Bill 151.
Thank you, Senator Jamir. We're back on
house Bill 151.
As amended.
We do have a floor
amendment.
The reader will read Senate
floor amendment number one to
House Bill 151
as amended amendment
sponsored by Senator
Greg
Smis. Senator Smide to move
and explain the amendment.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. I'd like to move.
Senate floor amendment number one to House
Bill 151 as amended,
hearing no objections, Senator Sms.
If you'll explain what the amendment
does. Thank you,  Mr.  President.
This firms up the definition
of affirmative consent to make sure
we're not including
prostitution.
Thank you, Senator seds. I'll yield
to the sponsor,
Senator
Mr.  President. This is an
unfriendly
amendment.
We are debating Senate floor amendment.
Number one. Anyone else wishing to
debate?
See, no Senator
Smedes to close on the
amendment. Thank
you very much,
Mr.  President.
Um,
perhaps this is just an
amendment.
Um,
so I can go to sleep at
night
and I'm very um you know,
it, it's unfortunate
that and it is good
to be, to be
friends with
the bill sponsor to be a true
friend with him.
But it is disappointing that
it's an unfriendly
amendment.
This is an amendment
that if it was taken,
I would be happy to
vote for the bill.
But one of the problems and
what we're doing and you're gonna hear more from
me on the bill and I'm
assuming there's not gonna be any more debate,
but I'll, I'm just gonna
wrap it up and then talk about
the bill in a
minute
if we just have two
consenting parties
that includes
prostitution.
All this does is
specifically say
we're going to say this does not
include sexual activity
for hire,
affirmative consent does
not mean that.
And I'm going to go into Roman
history if this
amendment doesn't pass and to
explain the
sexual contract
between people
across different civilizations
and how important this is Mister
President. So I would,
I would encourage the
body, especially
if they don't want to hear me go into
a very long diatribe
about Roman history.
We can accept,
we can accept the amendment
and I'll be happy to vote for the
bill.
All this does.
All this
does
is say affirmative
consent does
not include
prostitution. It does not
include two consenting
parties with the exchange of
money.
We're gonna not include
that. I don't
understand
how this is unfriendly
Mister President.
I think affirmative consent
is better than no means
no.
And I, I just don't see how
this is a stretch. This is, this
is my one
remaining
concern
with the affirmative consent
model because if we
start,
these are impressionable
people, the these, the people that are
going to be learning these affirmative
consent policies
are still in their
formative
years
and you implant that,
that concept into
their mind that hey, as long as you have some
consenting parties, anything
goes, she's good
with it. <She is> making some
money. He's good with
it. He's having a good time.
Affirmative consent
and you start to plant these
concepts in their mind,
Mr.  President. And
then the next thing you know,
and there is, there is
a a
ongoing
rising
movement
to allow prostitution
in this
country.
So please just,
it's not, it's not a
poison pill or anything
else. It is a
very sincere,
I've watched this bill for
years, Mister
President,
I've watched it for years. I've
thought about this issue for
years and I
think it's something we need to seriously
consider.
So I really, really would
humbly and sincerely
appreciate your vote on
this amendment. Mister President.
Thank you
Center,
who was the amendment for a vote? And
then how you would like that amendment to
be carried
out?
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
I won't move for unanimous
consent, but I would like to move
now. Senate
floor amendment number one to house
Bill 151
as amended. And I'd just like to ask
for a show of hands. Thank you.
Senators. We are voting on Senate floor
amendment. Number one to
your seats,
please.

your hand.

No,
by a vote of 13.
Affirmative
of
my vote of 13 in the affirmative
22 in the negative Senate floor amendment
number one has failed to
pass the Senate senators.
I'm sorry, Senator Ulta explains.
Vote. And Senator,
thank you very much,  Mr.  President  Mr.
President. The reason I voted no is
because when I read the
definition of affirmative
consent, which means affirmative
conscious and voluntary
agreement to engage in sexual
activity a remarkably
straightforward and
short
definition.
Um
If there's, if it's
sexual activity for
hire,
it seems that that also should
be affirmative conscious
and voluntary agreement
to engage in sexual
activity. And I
don't think that
sexual activity for hire
should be anything but
affirmative conscious and
voluntary. So
that's why I voted no
and can send an episode to
committees.
Thank you,  Mr.
President.
And um,
you know, this, this, this moment
for me is gonna go
down
very similar
to just one of those
few moments that you
reflect on
as a legislator, just the
very few that really
stand out in your mind.
And you kind of
wonder,
you just kind of wonder what's going
on, what's going
on in this place, what's going
on in our society,
you know, and
I
am I sleeping? Am I having a
nightmare?
Am I in the twilight
zone?
You know, best interests of the
child getting shot
down.
Affirmative consent means
affirmative conscience and voluntary
agreement.
That's,
that's prostitution right
there.
Affirmative conscious,
voluntary, happy to accept
that money.
That's it right there,  Mr.  President. Now,
I will have debate on the Bill. But
thank you,  Mr.
President
for the debate on the bill.
Senators
for a second time seeing anyone else
on the list. We have Senator
Sweeties. Uh
Mr.  President, I believe that's the first time on
the bill.
Is that correct? Senators?
I believe we were on the bill and I thought
you were debating that, but you were just,
I was closing. Thank you. Sorry for
the confusion there. That was
a little longer than usual. So
that's, that's on me. Thank
you. OK. Well, just
as promised,
um
you know, and, and this
uh I, I'm really glad I ran that
amendment so I can kind of see what's
going on here. You know, one of
the um
ongoing themes I've
noticed uh being
in the House and the Senate
is a
lack of
meaningful debate
on matters of
sexuality,
the lack of meaningful debate. And
when I hear
no debate,
I think of one word, I think of
shame, think of that
word,
shame,
no debate. Why
could it be
that?
Because your position is
indefensible?
Because if you actually
engage in debate, you
might have
to
start to talk about
these matters.
So let, let's talk about it since we
have time,
Mr.  President.
Let's talk about what's really going on
here. Let's talk about how we treat
women in our
society.
This is really personal
mister
president.
I am so, so
thankful
for my wife, been
married for 19
years,
only woman. I've been
with,
I have four
daughters.
And what kind of world am I looking
at?
Who's writing
the rules of
sexuality in
our society so that we need
to have bills like
this
because the playbook is
so stacked
against the women.
And it's so it's, it's, it's like
a jungle mr
President that we
have to have bills
like this to say, oh
well, we're
trying to figure this out.
We promised
women
liberation and the sexual
revolution,
but they didn't get it.
Sorry.
So now we're gonna say no means
no to help the
women.
Oh,
that didn't work,  Mr.
President.
So now we're going to come up with
this
and see if that
works.
It's not gonna
work.
Now we're going to come up with this affirmative
consent rule and try to keep
rewriting the
playbook.
Why is it not going to
work?
Well, first, let's, let's
talk about
where we are.
I mentioned the sexual revolution
kind of anything
goes.
Let's look at the modern
playbook.
Promiscuity,  Mr.
President
and just part
of the rules, you can just
have sex with anyone you want
to
go have
fun.
What does that lead
to?
Well, it leads to a bunch of disease.
We know that  Mr.
President
leads to broken
relationships.
What about adultery? You know, it used
to be kind of a big
deal and we'll get to
Roman culture,  Mr.  President.
It was actually a really big deal in
Roman culture,
adultery. It's not quite the way we
think about.
It
doesn't seem to mean much anymore,
it destroys marriages,
it destroys families.
That's part of the modern
playbook,
divorce.
What is it? 50%
or greater,
something like
that
harms Children and breaks up
families
this whole idea. And, and by
the way, I am
glad that we adopted an
amendment
that seems to
not dismay the
reporting of
abuse.
I think it's a little bit of a better
improvement on this bill,
but there's this movement about
not
reporting
where I come
from
in my value system.
I'm encouraged to really speak
up for people's
rights
to be proactive about doing
justice. And now we
have as part of this affirmative
consent
movement
we're, we're downplaying the
role for
reporting, for
reporting this abuse.
I don't understand
that.
I've heard the arguments on the other side
about it,
but I, I think it's
toxic.
I don't think it, it
helps.
We have some rules that we, you
know, agree on in the modern sexual
contract,
incest, bestiality.
We just had that one last
year.
Now, we're having new ones like
poly-amorous
relationships.
The City of Somerville Massachusetts
is now recognizing poly
amorous relationships by the
way.
And so I just ask you, what, what
value system do you
base
your views on
sexuality?
Is it just kind
of
the majority is
just
what you feel like?
Because then we start heading
down the road toward
all of this other
stuff.
It doesn't make much sense to
me.
So what are some feminists
saying about
what we're offering women
in our modern day
society?
Two of the award-winning books
from a couple of years ago, one was called
Rethinking Sex.
The other one was called The Case
Against The Sexual
Revolution were
award-winning books from a couple
years ago by
feminists.
And believe me, I'm not
necessarily endorsing this
book,
these books, but they do offer
us some insight about
how women are doing under
the modern-day sexual
contract of, of pretty
much anything goes. Apparently
prostitution goes
because we don't want to exclude
that from affirmative
consent.
Let's see how they're
doing.
These feminists argue
that young women are
often miserable
in our society
because they're
pressured.
They're pressured
to say that, hey, you're supposed to
be. Women are just supposed to
like
casual commitment, free
sex.
That's what they're told
in our modern day society. That's
how we treat
women
every day.
Well, maybe once or twice a week,
Mr.  President, when I'm in line
at the grocery store,
what do I see? What do we
all see? We
see magazines
of unreasonable
airbrushed
women
telling every woman that gets in
that line that of some
unrealistic
expectation about
her outward
appearance.
It's
wrong.
The beauty of a woman comes
from the inside,
from her noble
character,
not from her outside. And yet
our society tells
women over and
over again.
Internet grocery
stores everywhere
that it's their outward beauty
that's supposed to
matter.
That's how our society values
women.
You can really see that watching the Super
Bowl, can't you?
How we, what we think
about women and how we treat women in this
country makes me
sick.
Mr.
President.
The demographic,
guess which demographic
in our country is the most
depressed
that ain't
men.
Gen Z
women,
Gen Z women, mister
President.
They're the most common demographic
to be
depressed
in our
society.
Once again that that's just
sick.
One in five women
overall, not just Gen Z,
but 1/1 in five
women
overall
have a diagnosed
mental health
disorder.
And many estimate
that at least a third of
women in our
society have
either a diagnosed or if
you add the undiagnosed
mental health disorders, it
could be up to a third or even
greater. I wonder
why that
is.
Maybe it's the oppression of
our male-dominated sick
society that only
values women for
sex.
Maybe that just has something to
do about it.  Mr.
President.
Let's look at what might be driving
this.
Who has this
crazy, who has the crazy
high, who's driving the demand
for sex? It's
men
MADD mister President.
And let's, let's see who,
how we're adding
fuel to the fire. So we
supposedly need bills like
this.
Let's talk about our pornography
epidemic,  Mr.  President. That's that.
No one seems to want to
talk about. I'm happy to talk
about
it.
Pornography once
again,
reinforces into
the male mind, an
unrealistic
expectation,
not of just sex, but how
women physically
appear.
Now, let's go into some biology.
When, when
we develop
complex
loops and neural connections
in our brains, how
does that work? It is
a re a physical
rewiring
in the male
mind
when they're viewing pornography.
So you have two neurons that come
together,
the neurotransmitters
released from the first
neuron and
then they go and stimulate the next
neuron. And when
that connection,
when it, when it
snaps,
that second neuron recruits
more receptors
to it and the
more that's fired, the
more sensitive
that loop becomes.
So you, you are literally
rewiring and strengthening
the connections between the
neurons in your brain. Every
time you're looking at
pornography. We are
literally
hardwiring
the male mind to
objectify
women
over and over and over
again.
The only time
that online pornography
traffic drops in
this nation is during the
Super Bowl.
And really, I think that counts. I mean,
I mean, I don't know, I didn't watch the halftime
show. I don't let my kids watch the halftime
show
after the, uh, wardrobe
malfunction. I mean, it's, it's
pornography in the Super
Bowl too, so it probably doesn't
really
count.
Research studies show
that exposure to
pornography actually
increases your
likelihood of
trivializing rape and
sexual abuse.
Give me a break.
Give me a break about this
bill. We're doing nothing
about pornography
and we have the science to
show
that it
trivializes
our perception of sexual
abuse, obviously not in everybody,
but we have very,
very strong
evidence to show
that.
And I'm saddened to say
that people have introduced
legislation
into this body. So
the state would stop
subsidizing
pornography films
and guess what? Just
like the amendment to get
prostitution out of
the definition of
affirmative consent
on a party line vote.
Guess how that
legislation went?
Also a party line vote
to stop subsidizing
the very problem that
we're supposedly
trying to
fix
with affirmative
consent.
Mr.  President back to these
feminists who
are
giving us some of their insight
into the modern day
sexual
contract.
How do they further describe
this? They
say that as men and women have
sex,
the young women remember
these Gen Z that are the
most miserable, most depressed
demographic in our
society,
it says that these
women often become emotionally
attached
to the men. This is the, the feminist
opinion, ok.
They become emotionally attached to
the men they have sex with,
but the men don't feel the same
way
because remember it's the men that want
the commitment, free sex
in this country and
they're getting
it,
they're getting it because they're the ones
writing the
rules.
And we're not empowering the
women in, in
my mind enough
because not
only of our societal norms,
but even because the very
policy
that we support
the rules
of the modern-day sexual contract
had been written by men and
dominated by
men.
Guess who the producer of sex
and the city was a
man guess who
invented hormonal
contraceptives, two
men.
So now all of a sudden all the
pressure to not become pregnant,
all the responsibility
is on the women.
You got, you better be taking your
hormones. Sure
wouldn't want any
responsibility
or
consequences from all
of our commitment, free
sect.
And the men are putting that on
the women. They're putting that
weight on the
women.
You know, one of the early
um feminism
slogans
back in kind of the original
Feminism day. Check, check
this out. This is in
America,
quote votes for women
and this is part of
the women's suffrage movement.
Votes for women
chastity for
men.
No, is their political
slogan.
Well, I'm glad they
got women's
suffrage, but they didn't get the second
part
and I hope someday
we can give them that second
part.
I haven't gotten my hopes
up.
There is no way
by any means that
we can rewrite the rules
like we're trying to do
with affirmative
consent
and ignore the pornography
epidemic. There is absolutely
no way we can
ignore that without
women getting
burned.
Let's hear about some,
uh, some people that
aren't maybe a conservative Republican
on this issue. We've heard from some of
the feminists.  Mr.  President.
Let's hear from Billie
Eilish. That's how you
say your last
name.
You don't know who she is. <She is>
extremely
famous
pop star
icon
promised millions
of dollars to Texas
to kind of fight
their, you know,
some of their pro-life
laws,
very, very
pro-choice person,
very
liberal.
What does she say about the problem?
So you don't have to listen to me saying
it.
Well, in an interview
with Howard
Stern,
this is what she said. This
is just a few years
ago.
She said as a woman,
I think porn is a
disgrace.
I think it really destroyed my
brain. I feel incredibly
devastated
later. She said, I'm so
angry that
porn is so
loved
and I am so angry
at myself for thinking
that it was
ok.
<She is> seen how it destroys
women
in our country.
Now, since this amendment
was
um
was voted down. Let let's let's
go back into
different sexual
contracts and different
civilizations. Let's talk about
the
Romans
in, in Rome
prostitution was
legal
now, why, why was it legal?
I think this is hard for us to understand.
I think it's hard for me to
understand
the reason why it was legal
was because there was such a high
male demand
for sex.
And for the Romans prostitution
was basically a safety valve
to satisfy that
demand.
And that's one of my,
once again, one of my
concerns about the affirmative
consent model. You had
one of the arguably the
greatest, one of the greatest
civilizations
in history
that established basically
world peace for
200 years
developed all kinds
of
cultural, architectural
engineering,
marvels
and yet prostitution
was
legal.
Now, adultery was really
frowned upon because
Roman women did
have um quite
a bit of status. But we have to
keep in mind that the Romans
also had sex slaves
as well as prostitutes.
And so adultery
was really frowned upon if
you were a, a Roman
woman, a married Roman
woman
and those, those women were protected,
other women, not so
much
promiscuity really ruled the
land in Ancient
Rome, kind of like
it does now or at least
people say it's
OK.
Once again, I ask, how is that
going for the women in this
country?
And so my
point in bringing that
up is
if we are not going
to affirmatively
take a stand and
say, you know
what
affirmative consent does
not include
prostitution if we're not going
to teach.
And this is, this is higher ed
right here. But we
have, we have this model in our
high
schools.
If we are not going to
affirmatively teach and say,
hey, it's more,
it's more than just the
definition we're putting in this bill.
It's more than just two consenting
parties
because we need teachers
and professors and
counsellors to
stand up and say our
affirmative consent
model.
You know, that that's, that's just not
enough and to
impress that into our
young
people,
it's not enough.
If there's an exchange for
money, that's
wrong, we're going to draw the line
there. And the fact
that's such a great civilization
that that was just
normalized
in that society.
My concern is when
this starts to creep into our
society
once again in a society
that in my opinion, greatly
devalues women and
only values them for their
outward appearances
and for their ability to have
sex with men
that we're gonna creep toward
prostitution.
Sure seems like it because
we're voting for
it
later on. Um,
Constantine
legalized
Christianity.
I think this was about
in the three hundreds,
Justinian came
in, in the
500 started to,
to really,
um, rewrite
law
and bring Christian
values into
the law. And then the sexual
contract of the Romans
started to
change.
Prostitution went
away.
The winners in this were the
women, the
winners were the prostitutes
because prostitution was
illegal under
Justinian
law.
There were no, there were no longer
any sex slaves and
commitment was
valued
and that's why the women did much
better
under the
Justinian
laws.
You know, I don't have any statistics
about their mental health and whatever
else. You know, this keep
in mind this is what, 1500
years ago, at least.
But there was a law
and a demand
and a legal
construct
and a societal
expectation for
commitment.
And if you look at all these
studies,
researchers about
marriage and family
and sex.
If you, if you read
some of the modern feminist
books,
that's what they talk about.
Even the people that are
on the, on the other
side of this, for me, on the other
side of the
aisle,
they're not, they're not, they don't
have any religion to point to,
they don't have, they're not
Christians, they
don't, they're not looking at
Justin in law,
but they're talking about
trying to figure out
how can we get
out of this
mess
and getting out of this mess is
not affirmative consent. I'll
tell you that right
now,
especially if we're not gonna be
clear on what affirmative
consent is. We're gonna end
up
saying all the
things that I've that I've laid
out.
And so
I think women
experienced a great,
um
a great victory there
when we brought in those values
and started to talk about commitment.
And I think that is what
our society needs to reflect.
Now. A couple of
things,
an emphasis on
commitment
and we have a lot of the data,
we know that child
abuse and we've talked
about domestic abuse a
lot
during this legislative
session,
the rates of abuse and
harm and aces
are higher. Guess
what? When
there's a live-in
boyfriend.
Once again, we've got the
data,
live in boyfriend
not a husband but a live
in boyfriend.
Guess what's happening?
Commitment, free
sex.
It destroys
families, it harms
Children.
It's causing
depression
mainly in women in this
country.
And as I've said before, it,
it just is
so saddening to
me,
how are
deranged,
perverted
view of
sexuality
is destroying the family
unit.
And I further maintain that this
bill
will not get us any
closer
unless we start messaging
about men
stepping up and
committing to
women
and women not feeling
pressured. The
fact that all that's out
there are men that seem
to want to have commitment,
free sex.
You know, there's a lot of dating studies
that, you know, especially at
universities and they
ask women,
why are you, why are you either not
dating? Why are you not seeking to
date someone? Why blah, blah,
blah? And that's
what they say. They
say that the
the market if you will
is not offering what I
want,
there's no supply,
there's no supply. Why?
Once again, one
of the major reasons is because
we are literally
training up men to
objectify
women
all day, every day on
their smartphones and their
computers
and no one seems
to want to talk about
it.
So I'm glad we have an opportunity
to talk about it at 11 o'clock
at night in a bill
that seems like a pretty
big emergency
to me.
I'm glad we have this opportunity
and forgive my tone.
Like I said, this really is personal
for
me.
And I'm thankful that I've
had wonderful
men in my
life that
have modelled
commitment,
modelled fatherhood
to me. I haven't
done anything by myself. This
isn't, these aren't my
ideas. These are
because wonderful, faithful
godly men have poured into
my life.
I think we're all a product
of our
families, how we were raised,
our teachers, all the,
the loving relationships
that we've had
that have, that have poured their
wisdom into all of
us. And I'm
certainly no
exception.
I'm very indebted to a lot of the
people that have poured into my
life and
imparted their wisdom on
me.
So  Mr.  President, I would
just ask this
body
to once again, please
think deeply
about how
we're addressing
the rules of sex in our
society. Who
are the winners? Who
are the
losers?
Are we gonna continue to go
down this road and
act like nothing's
wrong?
Are we gonna continue to
do nothing
about training up legions
of men to
literally even if
they have a will to do it.
They can't because their brain
has been so
hardwired
to just look at a woman and just
think that's a sex object
right
there.
How are we gonna dig ourselves
out of this hole? Get ourselves out of
this hole.
It's not with this
bill.
So we've got to continue to think
about commitment. How can
we as
legislators?
Somehow we
can't, we can't change people's
hearts with the
law. But
how can we take
leadership
to engage in pro
commitment
policy,
pro family
policy
and you can see it
in, in
demographics that are
poor
and we see it over and over again
in our society
who is not doing well.
Well, look at all of the
out of wedlock births
that we're having and you look
at the demographics and how
that is connected
to how <AAA>
society
is doing. We have something
called the success
sequence. We talk
about poverty.
I really appreciate my fellow
legislators' comments on
poverty. By the
way,
once again, we
have the data,
Mr.  President,
we have the data on poverty
and guess what
it's related
to our
sexuality.
Let me elaborate on that, Mister
President.
If you're not familiar with the success
sequence, it's a series of three
things that if you check
off,
you have a
2%
risk of
poverty in
this country.
2%.
And we have the
data, we have the
knowledge
talking about all kinds of things.  Mr.
President throwing money
at this and that
we're gonna get people out of
poverty.
We have TANF
and snap and we have all kinds
of
resources.
But we have a formula
that gives you a 98%
chance not
being in poverty.
And what is that?
Hopefully I get this right from my
memory. I didn't write it down.
Number one is obtaining
a high school diploma
or a
ge
number
two
is working a full time
job,
okay.
And number three
is waiting to have
Children until
you're
married.
And so  Mr.  President,
poverty is related to our
sexuality. It is
related
to men not
committing to women because
it causes and it leads
to
poverty.
All these violations
that keep women down and
oppressed and depressed.
They lead to poverty,
promiscuity,
adultery,
divorce,
they all leaded poverty because they
lead you away from that success
sequence. They lead us away from
strong
families.
So I don't, I don't really see us
addressing
root
causes
in this
bill.
I see us looking up at
some
giant
fire,
a huge forest
fire
and we have
like a little water
gun,
Mr.  President. We are going the
wrong way in our society.
We're not, we're not drifting
toward or going toward
commitment in our
sexual relationships.
And I don't see how we're
moving toward valuing
women for their character
and not their outward
appearance.
If we could just do those two
things,
women will be doing much
better in our
society.
You know, once
again, from my
value
system,
I would contend
that when a man is in a relationship
with a woman,
you are supposed to love that
woman in a self
sacrificial
way. And I think we would
all agree with that. At
least that part,
we don't seem to be able to agree with
much in how
we would write the rules of
the modern day sexual contract. But
I think, I think that we could
agree with that one. That,
that's a beautiful
thing
that men should be willing to
give up things
for the women that they
love.
And so maybe I can end on
a positive note,
a little, a little
area
where we agree
on.
But I don't see the spirit of
that being
legislated, at least, certainly
not
here.
And so,
you know, I'm sure
Mr.  President, all the members,
I'm sure
even on my side, I, I know
this is, is
late,
but I'm telling you, like I
said, it's
personal, I cannot just
stay silent on this
bill.
Women are systemically
oppressed in our society
and it's because
of selfish
men that
just want to use them for sex. Let's
not vote for this bill. It's
just gonna be kicking
the can down the road.
More of these problems. You,
you want to know where the sexual
abuse comes from.
It's all the reasons I've
mentioned
poisoning the minds
of men all across our
country while
we stay
silent.
Thank you, Senator
Smedes. Send
us to the office.
Thank you.
Um,
has often happens,
Dr Schmiddy, um,
makes some really good
points but then
goes in a direction opposite
from me.
Um, some of what he said actually
triggered me.
And so I feel the
need to read something that I
wrote, um, a few
years ago and I guess it's
dated December 9th,
wrote and published.
It's, it's, um,
dated December 9th
2017.
So I'm just gonna read it
because II
I, uh, these are issues that are
difficult to talk
about
as a clinical law professor
and a domestic violence
advocate. I have
counselled many survivors
who have inexperienced
everything from a
sexually hostile workplace
environment to brutal
rape
with my own college experience
with rape in the late
seventies. Like
so many women, I did not
report it.
I did not even tell friends or
family about it at the time
because I was afraid,
I felt ashamed and
embarrassed. I felt
isolated and
I wasn't aware of any services
that might be available.
It has taken me years
to work out how the trauma has
affected me.
But that isn't just my
story. This
is the story of one in four
women and girls
and the one in 20 men and
boys in New Mexico who
have been raped and
or victimized by
uncompleted rape.
It is the story of Latina
Dom, domestic workers in
Albuquerque who are sexually harassed
and even raped at work
but are afraid to disclose
their victimization because of their
legal status.
It is a story of a young
woman who told me that she was raped
while enlisted in the military
and when she reported it to her
senior officers, some
of them women told
her, what did she, what did
she expect after all?
She is so pretty.
It is a story of an incest
survivor
who discovered that her father
had been sexually abused as a
child. It
is the story of a
transgender woman who told
me that she does not
know a single transgender
individual who has not
been brutally raped and
or sexually
assaulted.
I do believe that individuals
today have many more
services available to them
than I did and
indeed, they may be empowered and
encouraged to speak out against
harassment, assault and
rape. But it is
still happening at
staggeringly high
rates especially
to young, vulnerable women,
Children, LGBT
L BT Q I
individuals and disabled
individuals,
things have to change.
We have to do better than
simply provide services.
We need to stop the
behaviour entirely
and we need to change the way
our government responds to
abuse and discrimination
and offer solutions that are
worthy of those brave
survivors who are outing
themselves to make progress on
this issue.
I've seen what bad
policy can do to
people and
my own experiences
drive me to change
it
after
it was written when Trump was
president, after this president
was elected by the Electoral
College, us.
Immigration and customs enforcement
agents started showing up at the
courthouses which
caused great fear among
immigrants who were victimized.
They were afraid of getting the restraining
orders they needed or even
testifying at the criminal trials
of their abusers.
I organized domestic violence
and sexual assault agencies to
ask the new Mexico Supreme
Court to stop
permitting ice agents
to detain individuals of the
courthouse because
it deprived immigrants of
access to our justice
system,
which of course further
victimized them.
I knew that so much of the work
we had done over decades
was at risk. Our
country was going backward
under this administration.
I could could
and could not
and will not let that ha that
happen. So I stepped up to
run for office.
I believe that the power of our
story should take us beyond
just a nat national
conversation on
sexual assault and
harassment
and will is toward proactive
solutions that transform our
cul culture.
The costs of trauma are too
steep to ignore these
costs, costs not only
affect the physical and social
well-being of victims
but also has a negative
effect on their economic
potential. Has
such efforts to resolve
this pervasive problem
should be on the scale
of our federally funded
anti-smoking campaigns
which are co-ordinated and
centralized and give survivors
a seat at the table.
Only then can we truly
believe to heal as
survivors and transform our
country?
This
bill
was drafted
and
was
promulgated
and advocated
for by
survivors.
I strongly urge my
colleagues to support this
bill and I thank the sponsor
for bringing it. Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Cyia
Lopez

Thank you,  Mr.

is a second bill,  Mr.  President
that we've seen, uh
go the
approximately the same
way zero
debate really on

just answers that
are obtuse
and nonsensical
and uh on this
very debate, just not
really any information, there's nothing
being given to the people
watch New Mexico
watch who's voting,
how they're voting?
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
We're going on to the next item that's
on the paint calendar item.
Number six. That's going to
be House
Judiciary Committee, substitute for House
Consumer and Public Affairs Committee.
Substitute for House Bill
239 and III
two center for that
bill.
Famous president. I guess I've just got the
microphone
tonight
going out with a bang
here. Uh
Mr.  President
asking mis
consent of the Senate that the record show
that all action for placing
um,
house judiciary
Committee substitute for
House CPAC
committee, substitute for
House Bill
239
um
has been taken and that
it is now subject to debate, amendment
or substitution,
hearing no
objections to
explain what the bill does.
Mister President. This
bill simply
adds
cannabis to the
contraband
definition. Our, our
prisons were
having some issues with this.
And
so they, they asked to
get this in.
Um, that, that's all the
bill does. Thank you,  Mr.  President. Thank
you, Senator SIDS. We do have debate. We
have Senator
Nibert.
Thank you,  Mr.
President
Mr.  President.
On page
two lines,
19 through
24
there apparently
was raised one
issue that I think
we need to clarify
and that was whether or
not this
bill would
force
prisons to allow
medical cannabis
into the
facility.
Go ahead, Senator I
and the, the
issue I
think is, is
set forth in
here that it
requires
the
uh
detention
facility
to
have a policy
before that's allowed.
So I'll just read the
language,
it says a controlled
substance as defined
in the controlled substances
Act or cannabis
as defined in the cannabis
Regulation Act,
but does not include a
controlled substance or
medical cannabis
carried into a prison
or jail.
And here's the pertinent
language through regular
prison or jail
channels and
pursuant to the direction
or prescription
of a licensed
physician.
So I believe
uh  Mr.  President
and, and
uh Senator Sms, I
believe that this language
says
that two conditions
must be met in order
for medical cannabis to
enter a facility. Number
one, it has to
be through
regular
channels
of the, uh,
detention facility or
prison.
Secondly, it
has to be prescribed by
a physician.
And so with those two things in
place, I don't think one
can read it as
requiring a
detention facility
to allow it. Should they
choose not to?
Uh, and I just, uh,  Mr.
President and, and,
uh, Senator Me, I just want to
clarify that if you have any
comment.
Yes,  Mr.  President and
Senator. So
all this does so right
now, none of
this is considered
contraband,
but the prisons are having issues
with just kind
of under the table or recreational
cannabis. So
all it adds
in all that's becoming
contraband in this
bill is
the, the so-called. Let's just
call it Elizabeth illicit
cannabis.
And we're just being explicit
that we're not making
medical cannabis
fitting it under the definition
of contraband. So, so once
again, neither
of these are considered contraband
now and
all we're doing is carving
out specifically that illicit
cannabis and adding it to
contraband. But being
clear that
that that definition
does not include medical cannabis
and then the prisons can, you
know, through rulemaking or whatever else
they can do what they, what
they are presently doing with medical
cannabis. This, this the way
that it's written, it should not
affect how
they're treating medical cannabis right now
whatsoever. All it's
actually accomplishing
is that illicit cannabis
and adding it to the contraband so
they can, they can take
action if people are, are kind
of sneaking that into the,
the prisons.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. That's
the one clarification I
wanted to make. Thank you. Thank
you, Senator Sms. Thank you, Senator
Nibert. Seeing
no further debate, Senator
Schmidty's to close on the
bill. Thank you
very much,  Mr.  President.
Um, I'd like to
move that, uh,
house
President.
I apologize. Senator, by the, you
did have your hand up my, my fault.
Senator Paia, apologize.
Senator Senator Paia.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. I appreciate
the sponsors, you know,
consent to excuse Senator Pinto
until his return to the chamber
except for the purpose of the call. And thank
you to the sponsor. Thank you,
Senator Padilla, apologize.
Senator. Thank you very much,
Senator Padilla. Thank you,  Mr.
President. I'd
like to move now.

I used to be on that committee,  Mr.  President,
uh House Bill
239.
Um, do now

except those voting in the negative by show
hands. Thank you, Senator Senators.
