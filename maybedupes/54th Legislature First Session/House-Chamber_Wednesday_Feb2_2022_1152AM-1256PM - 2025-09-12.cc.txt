Good afternoon this is the good
afternoon members I move that we

business no objections ordered.
Good afternoon everyone.
Today's the last day of bill
introduction.
So please remember if you have
any great ideas jacketed now is
the time to turn them in.
Also.
members we need to do another
refresher on how the voting
system works.
Service so please pay attention.
If we are on a roll call.
During the first five minutes.
you push the button at your
seat.
If you are marked excused.
You still push the button and
then you are no longer Martinez
using you are marked with the
test for being present.
If you walk into the room if you
walk into the chamber after the
first five minutes.
An attempt to push a button you
can't do that because the system
has been.
Deactivated and the chief clerk
is calling people's names out.
She only calls those who have no
response if you are marked
excuse she will not call your
name.
This was the topic of our
conversation several days ago so
this is another reminder that it
is not a flaw in the system
nothing is broken nothing is
failing to work or to record
your vote you see you know that
if you're in the room you're
marked excuse the chief clerk
when I call your name.
Annually to the marches excuse

Gentleman from Bernalillo.
Then go to the services
announcements and miscellaneous
business no objections order
okay so we have most of us here
so let me explain how these
generic bills work for the new
members over the last several
years what we've done is adopted
a policy where
we will upon request if any of
the.
Sponsors of the Jericho's
withdraw the bill from the rules
committee referring to the
committee where the chairperson
as the chair or to a different
committee and we will announce
at that time the two oh two
number for the committee
substitute than those are then
published on the website
I think on the there is a link
on the agenda.
That with the public has notice
for what the steps to bill is
before the bill is hurting
Committee it's a bit of an
unusual practice but we thought
that was a good to the.
Make a practice to the public
knows what's being heard in
committee so beginning tomorrow
the end the session you'll hear
me withdraw built in rules
committee and SO two two number
where the bill is going and then
it'll be added to the agenda
it's worked well for the last
several years that we've done
that so that's how that works
And.
I am we have Representative
Debbie Armstrong
she's not serving on committees
currently I am appointing her to
the Judiciary Committee.
Since you have a committee serve
on Representative Armstrong
Debbie Armstrong as you
appointed to the Judiciary
Committee.

announcements.

reminded by the Senate that we
do have a basketball game on
February tenth calling all
basketball players give I manage
your time so you won't get her
and
I thought that I didn't realize
that the game is on it so it's a
big fund raiser for the UNM
Cancer Institute and is super
great costs and
my colleague mom my **** is in
charge of the rounding up all
the basketball players
on the disabled list so I'll be
right you guys on thank you Mr

I'll probably fifteen years that
I believe many of the members
house and Senate hasn't.
So this is we're trying to plan
it.
How the.
Could not do it because we don't
have the employees.
And and not Joel and I were
talking and that's very
interesting because they have
three stores that are open but
they don't have enough folks
that want to work.
So that they could come appears
in the day.
Us so like many other companies
we're struggling.
For employees.
And so this one strain on
brewery unemployed their jobs
out there and I just wanted
everyone to know because a
number of the members are asked
are you doing pod rules this
year so now we're not doing
drugs is here because we don't
have the employees thank you Mr
