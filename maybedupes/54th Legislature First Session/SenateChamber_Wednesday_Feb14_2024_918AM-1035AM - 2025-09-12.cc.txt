You

President.
Thank you. I ask that everyone, please
rise for the invitation to be
led today. Hiroshi
Joan Halifax,
Abbot of UAA Zen
Center here in Santa Fe, New
Mexico will lead
us in the prayer.
Please remain standing for the pledge
of allegiance to be led today by Senator
mckenna, the pledge of
allegiance in Spanish to be led today
by Senator Steinborn
and the salute to New Mexico
flag to be led today by Senator
Burt.
So first, I want to
wish all of you a
good Valentine's
day and
I want to thank you after your
late night for showing up this
morning.
And many of you have
ashes on your forehead
and that speaks
to the work that you're
doing a work
of really
profound self sacrifice,
on behalf of
the well being
of all beings in this
state. So thank
you.
Let's take a
breath.
May we be
an instrument
of peace
where there is hatred,
so love
where there is
injury,
pardon?
Where there is doubt,
faith,
where there is
despair,
hope
where there is
darkness,
light
where there is
sadness,
joy.
May we be a
safeguard for
those who have
no protection,
a guide for
those who journey
along the
way
for those who wish to
go across water.
May we be a boat,
a raft, a
bridge?
May we be a homeport
for those who yearn
for landfall
and a lamp for
those who long
for light?
For those who are tired.
May we be
a resting
place
for all who
need help
their
servant?
May we be
generous and
helpful?
May we cultivate
and strengthen
integrity?
May we be patient
and clearly
see the suffering
of others?
May we be energetic,
steadfast and
wholehearted?
May we be stable and
grounded? So we
can skillfully serve
all beings.
May we nurture
wisdom and
in part the
benefit of
insight to
others?
May we not so
much seek to be
consoled
as to console,
to be understood
as to
understand,
to be loved
as to
love
like the great
earth
herself,
enduring as
the sky
endures
for the multitude of
living
beings.
May we always
offer respect
and care to all
that lives
and to the
ancestors.
Finally, may
we affirm
our intention to serve
others through
love and compassion
and our commitment to
actualize
respect
and integrity
in all that we
do
a
man.
I pledge of allegiance
to the flag of the
United States of
America and
to the Republic for which
it stands one
nation under
God indivisible
with liberty and justice
for
all.
I salute the flag
of the State of New Mexico
and the Zia symbol of
perfect friendship among
United Cultures.
The
you may be
seated
once again, I would like to welcome each of
you to the chamber today and I'll yield to
Senate majority floor leader Peter Worth
to take us to that first order of
business. Uh Thank you,  Mr.
President. Uh good morning,
everyone, unanimous consent. We go to that
our business announcements, miscellaneous
hearing, no objection. In that
order of business announces
miscellaneous Senator Peter
Worth. Uh Thank
you,  Mr.  President and
thank you Roshi
Halifax for being
here. Uh
for your
words. I always think
any, any time we start with a deep
breath. That's a good thing.
And we've got
27 or 20 some,
some number of hours. We're now in
a real countdown, but
I just thought your invitation
was particularly appropriate,
uh, for this morning.
Uh, again, it's,
it's true. We all
are working on all of
our issues and that
respect and integrity
is so important
and kind of the realization
that the well being
of those outside,
both humans and
all creatures really
uh something that we're working
on. So thank you for
being here. Uh
So today is
Los Alamos County Day and
Senator Jamil has a certificate
that he's going to talk about and some guests to
introduce. It's also
suicide prevention
day at the legislature.
Uh I believe Senator Pinto
may have a
certificate she's just gonna
talk about and
just for member, we're
going to do a split, probably
multiple split session
today. So up
front, we're not going to do
certificates
for members that are leaving
us. We'll do those at one
today and just really
encourage, keep
us on track with certificates
and announcements this morning.
Uh dinner tonight will be
our traditional Chinese
dinner and we have a number of
sponsors who've made that happen. We
appreciate that very much.
Uh It will be served in the Senate
lounge, uh
530 this
evening. So with that, I'd
yield to other members
um to introduce guests and then
I'll give a sense of
how we're gonna roadmap for
today. Thank you, Senator
Peter Wirth. I yield to senate
majority whip
Michael Paia. Thank
you very much,  Mr.  President Yan's consent
to allow cameras in the senate chamber
and senate gallery.
See no objections. Cameras will
be allowed today. Senator,

like to introduce their
guests.
Senator Duhigg, would you like to introduce
your guest?
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
I have here with me today
uh Mateo
Lujan and Mateo
is the nephew of
our amazing uh Senate
rules analyst, Esperanza
Lujan. But Mateo
is a junior at La Cueva High
School in Albuquerque and he's
the captain of the model
United Nations Club there.
He has an interest in history
and policy uh especially
because these two subjects affect
societies as a whole.
And he's especially interested in
advancing affordable public
transit. And we're hoping
very much that we can convince him to
come join us in this chamber
at some point in the future. So
members, please help me welcome
Mateo.
Thank you, Senator
Senator Campos. Thank
you very much,  Mr.  President, members of
the Senate with me Here

Math. Mateo is also a

Mateo intends to pursue
a career in government and law,

Thank you, Mister President and
thank you for allowing me to introduce
my guests and members of the body.
I would like to for you to
welcome Cmy Tutin. She
is an advocate that is
advocating for the indigenous
centres in Santa Fe and
Albuquerque and
back to my Gallup roots.
She played for Gallup High back
in the day when
Gallup was actually on
that state title
run for the
Mexico girls' state
title and it
was a very,
I cried
when they got it. So
another person
I enjoyed in my basket
ball arena in history
that I've touched base with and a very
dear friend. But
thank you for joining us Senate.
Please welcome Tammy
Tchen.
Thank you, Senator Pinto, Senator
Steinborn.
Thank you,  Mr.  President
Colleagues. It is my very
high honour to be welcomed by the
Wild Friends program.
UN M
and please rise, wild
friends, wild friends have
been coming to the legislature
for, gosh, I don't know, a decade
or more with
this program learning about
the legislative process
trying to protect
our, our Mother Earth
and advanced
legislation that
will help do those things today.
They had a memorial on citizen
science and volunteering
to help agencies
collect a and things like that
and they did a fantastic job in
Senate Rules Committee. So
I'm going to introduce them real
quick. Um We have
Maximos, not Gras

does an incredible job. Please
welcome the wild friends,
everybody.
Yeah.
All right.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Thank
you, Senator
Steinborn.
Senator Pinto. Thank
you, Mister President and members
of the body a while
back when my grandfather
was here, Senator Campos
had the,
would you be my Valentine
to my
grandfather?
And after that,
because he was the most senior
member, we honored
Senator Ingle when he was the
most senior member.
And today would have been
when we would have honored
Senator
Picos for being the most
senior member. But it came a couple
of days early.
But I would like to
nominate
Senator Leo Jarmil
as the new Mexico
State Senate spirit
leader in
that sense of my father
going on. And
I know people still feel like,
you know, that presence in the
building and,
and kind of like where
I'm sitting is
still there. But
Leo Senator
Harmel really brings in
smile to our faces
and I know you did have a very
challenging year,
uh earlier
and you know, that strength and
support that he's able to
come to us and
enlighten us and bring
that forward. So
Senator Jamil, I also
have
a,
a great big kiss for
you
to give you
and also encourage the members
to come by.
Senator
Harm's our desk for,
for your own kiss from
him. Thank
you, Mister President and members of
the body. Thank you, Senator Pinto.
Congratulations,
Senator.
Any further announcements
from
senators,
Senator  Mr.
President? I think that Senator
Pinto just made me her
Valentine and I
accept
Mr.  President today happens to
be Los Alamos County Day
and so we don't have everyone here, but
I still want to go ahead and speak to that
if you're ok.
Mr.  President Los Alamos
County is located above
the Mesas and canyons of the
Pajarito Plateau
plateau and was
home to the ancestors of
current native American Pueblo
people for more than 400
years, Los Alamos
County in the decades, leading up to
the turn of the 20th century
was also influenced by
Spanish land grant holders,
homesteaders, merchants,
farmers, and ranchers
before being acquired by the US
federal government in
1942
for the Manhattan project
and eventually incorporated as a
New Mexico County in
1969
Los Alamos County is home
to my employer, employer for
the past 25 years.
And I like to call Los Alamos
County. My second
home, Los Alamos
National Laboratory welcomed
me in as a high school coop
student and it was two
mentors who then told me
education would be the key to my
success. Those mentors
helped me filter out a college
application and
my financial aid form
and reminded me when I dropped
those two pieces
of parcels into the mail
slot, that education would
be the key to my success.
Los Alamos County and
Los Alamos National Laboratory
means so much to
me.  Mr.
President Los Alamos
County is currently the gateway
to three National Parks,
the Manhattan Project,
National Historic Park,
the Vande National Monument
and the Valles Caldera National
Preserve in December
of 2022.  Mr.
President at American World
War Two Heritage City.
Uh We joined 17
other communities which
were honored for our contributions
to support America's war
efforts during World War
Two. Now senators
on your desk, you will
find that there's a
valentine box from our
elementary students from Los
Alamos public schools. And
some of you also got a special
Valentine letter from
some of our students who selected
20 of you to receive that.
You'll also get a swag bag from
Los Alamos County and I see
that Senator Hamlin was wearing her
scarf earlier and
I want to introduce some guests,  Mr.
President. If there's no one else who would like
to make comments on Los Alamos
Day.
Thank you, Senator Jamil.
Proceed. Senator. Thank
you. They might not all be here, but I'm gonna still
call them out.  Mr.  President
Steven Linn County
Manager, Ann
Lauren, current deputy
county manager and incoming
county manager, Linda
Matson, deputy county
manager, Jennifer
Guy, Los Alamos public
school superintendent,
Troy Hughes, Los
Alamos fire department
chief Lauren
mcdonald L A
CD mcdaniel L
A CDC, executive
director, Daniel
Duran, my neighbour in
Espanola, the L AC
Intergovernmental
Affairs Manager,
Naomi Maestas
county clerk, Denise
Turis, our county council chair
and there's also Los Alamos
public school students who are walking
around. Ladies and gentlemen,
my friends from Los Alamos County, if
you can rise and if you can
help me, welcome them to the
chamber.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Thank you, Senator
Jamil, Senator Brandt.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
And
yeah, I've been building up to
this. We
have a, this is our last
full day
and you know, I've talked about
Israel just about every
day of this session.
And so I, I would
like to read a memorial
that um
was never allowed to
be heard in
committee.
It's too bad. The reader can't read
it, but I'll do it a
memorial supporting the state
and the people of Israel and condemning
the Hamas terrorist
organization.
Whereas on October 7th
2023
Hamas, a terrorist
organization
engaged in a series of
premeditated, co-ordinated
and brutal terrorist attacks against
the state of Israel and its people.
And whereas the
attacks resulted in a
horrific massacre,
including the firing of thousands
of rockets into areas
populated by
civilians, door
to door raids in civilian
neighborhoods and an assault on a
music festival where
more than 260
people were indiscriminately
brutalized, assaulted,
taken hostage and murdered.
Whereas
over 1000
200 Israelis have been
killed. And more than 5000
Israelis and foreign
nationals have been injured
in the attacks. And
whereas
132
Israelis remain unaccounted
for
out of an estimated
240
Israelis that were taken hostage
by Hamas with Children
and elderly people among
the hostages. And
whereas on December
2nd, 2023 the
Vice President of the United States
confirmed that 35
American citizens were
killed in the terrorist
attacks launched by Hamas.
And whereas Hamas
has long called for the
eradication of the state
and the people of Israel and
sought to slaughter, brutalize
and abduct innocent Israeli
civilians.
And whereas Hamas has routinely
used innocent civilians to
shield their weapons and
terrorist militants from
le from legitimate
military engagement,
resulting in civilian deaths
that are entirely the fault of
Hamas. And
whereas Hamas
says use of human
shields is a violation of
international humanitarian
law and an egregious
war crime. Now
therefore, be it resolved
by the state
by the Senate of the State of New
Mexico. The members of the Senate,
the State of New Mexico unequivocally
condemned the Hamas terrorist
organization and
the premeditated, co-ordinated
and brutal terrorist attacks it
made on the state
and the people of Israel.
Be it further resolved? The
members of the Senate
of the State of New Mexico extend
their unwavering support
to the state and the people of
Israel and mourn
those who were killed
in the attacks and be it
further resolved, the copies of this
memorial be transmitted to the
president of the United States.
United States Secretary of State,
United States, ambassador
to Israel, president
pro tempore of the
United States Senate
and the Speaker of the United States House
of Representatives
and New Mexico's
congratu congressional
delegation.
This is the memorial that was
so
controversial
that we were not allowed to
hear it,
so
controversial
that we couldn't even take it
up.
It's a little disappointing to
me
that standing against a terrorist
organization that brutally
murdered
and killed more Israelis and
have been killed since the
Holocaust.
We couldn't even hear.
Thank you,  Mr.
President.
Thanks Senator Brat. Do we have further
announcements?
Senators
Smores.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Um I
appreciate you coming over last night
and helping me bake you these cookies for
everyone. Uh I just wanted to
say, uh, these are from the,
from U and M uh president
and I stayed up all night
putting these up after the
game by the way. So we were really
tired. We had Senator or TC Pino
come over after he finished
coaching, uh, the players
on how to hit three pointers.
It was a heck of a game last night. If you
didn't see it, our former coach
Ald was crying
after the game, which was
amazing. And like I said earlier
in the session, it's the last time we'll
be able to talk about it. But the lobos are
back and on
the topic of the lobos and the
cookies that we have. Uh, we just
got a report from
247 sports
that list ranked uh
coach Menen Hall as an
A plus hire for New
Mexico, the best hire
of the season for the football
team. And it was, it was really
exciting. They said it was a
amazing hire.
Uh Bronco has been a big
winner everywhere he's gone.
Uh It was a surprise, New
Mexico, um, got
him. Shocking was the word they used
many believe that he could have
had landed a bigger gig,
uh, out West such as Boise
State. So we're really excited
about the where our basketball
team is and the future of the football
team. And last time you're probably
gonna hear from me about this. But
Go Lobos. Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Thank you, Senator Morris. We appreciate
the cookies. Thank
you.
Any further
announcements,
seeing no further announcements, Senator
Peor to take us to the next
order of business. Thank you,  Mr.
President. So as I mentioned
last night, what we're going to
do in terms of third reading
in this morning session
is item number
one on today's
calendar. Capital Outlay
Roff, that's Senator
Rodriguez. Item number
two, which is the capital
outlay projects bill,
also Senator Rodriguez
and then item number
14, which is the General
obligation bonds.
Also Senator Rodriguez.
So she's going to do all three
this morning. There
are two concurrent
calendars that we're going to
do after we get done with third
reading. I'm going to go ahead and hand those
out. One
is Senator Deggs
Senate Judiciary Committee
for Senate Bill six, the cannabis
regulations
and the second is the bill
IED fire po
place. So I'm going
to hand those out up front. So everyone get
a chance to look at those and we'll
do the concurrence after the third
reading uh uh
this morning. And then the plan
is to take a break for
committees and depending on when we
finish up, uh will
depend on when we come back
probably a little bit afternoon.
Uh So with that,  Mr.  President
unanimous consent, we go to that order of
business third reading of legislation
and I yield to Senator Rodriguez for item
number one Senate finance
Committee, substitute for Senate Bill
246 with the emergency
clause hearing no objection.
We in that order of business
third reading of
legislation,
Senator Rodriguez. Thank you,
Mr.  President. I ask unanimous
consent of the Senate that the records show
that all action for placing
Senate Bill 246
on final passage has been
taken and that it is now
subject to debate amendment or
substitution hearing.
No objection, Senator
Rodriguez to explain
the bill. Thank you,  Mr.  President.
This is the annual
reauthorization bill
of our capital projects
and infrastructure
statewide
and it
authorizes 253
capital projects authorized
in previous years from various
funds. The estimated
balance on the projects
included in the bill
as of January
is $137
million. Keep in mind that,
that number keeps changing
because these are projects that are
ongoing. So the
balance will always be
fluctuating. Uh
and projects may be
reauthorized to extend the
reversion date, expand the
language or change the purpose
of the original appropriation
or to change the administrative
agency and
uh supply chains, labour
shortages, um
delays, cost,
escalations and
capacity limitations may
have delayed the progress
of of these projects.
So we have to
reauthorize uh what
we can and uh
you have before you,  Mr.
President, members of the Senate
charts that
are summarized by
county and
by agency
so that they would be easy to read
and you can see the projects.
That's what it does,  Mr.
President.
Thank you, Senator Rodriguez Senators. We're
debating Senate Finance Committee,
substitute for Senate Bill 246
with the emergency clause and I
yield to Senator Woods on the
reauthorization.
Uh Thank you  Mr.
President and not
to encourage the,
the uh Senate
to uh
vote for this.
This some of
our problems with
this. Uh
D fa has a hard
time sometimes getting
contracts out.
And that makes, you know,
when you only have a few
months to in
incur
the
5% that
it takes to keep this money
active. It is very
hard to do for local
governments. This
particular bill
reauthorizes
somewhere around
100 and $75
million worth of
projects. Now, those
projects are in your
local districts.
I want you to think about
that. Your local
districts. These are monies
going into your local districts.
We encourage
you to
encourage your local
governments to get this money
spent.
Uh There is
probably and
it may very well
be the last
time we reauthorized
these projects,
these monies will be pulled
back if they're not
spent this go around.  Mr.
President. Very
important bill.
Very important
purposes. Thank you,
Mr.  President. Thank you,
Senator
Woods
seeing no further
debate,
Senator Rodriguez to close
on the bill. Thank you,  Mr.
President. I move that Senate
Bill 246
do now pass and I ask unanimous
consent of the Senate that the records
show that the rule has been called and all
those present voted in the
affirmative except for those
voting
except for those voting in the
negative by show of hs. Thank you
senators. We are voting all senators
to your seats,
please.
If you wish to vote, no, please
raise your
hand.
Senator Brantley voting.
No, Senator Pirtle
voting. No,
Senator Tallman voting
now
Senator Munoz, are you voting
now?
Senator Moore is voting?
No, Senator
mccutcheon voting.
No
Senator Brandt voting.
No,
Senator Moore is voting
now
by a vote
of 31 in the affirmative
six in the negative.
Senate Finance Committee, substitute
for Senate Bills 246
with the emergency clause has passed
the Senate. Senator Munoz
to explain his
vote.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. You
know this Rio,
the capital outlay list. I I
will tell you that I did
Roff and projects that weren't
moving for me.
But at this point in time
and moving forward,
I am not gonna entertain
a Rio Bill in Senate
finance. It's
time for projects to
either get
done or
fail
if you put a project on
this list and, and three
years later, it, it hasn't
moved. It's
six years worth of money
that's just sitting there
that didn't do anything
for six years
next year, I think the EXEC
is talking about only
doing capital to complete
projects
and that will probably be the best
thing that could happen as we
sent out guidelines for our
members. But as
we look through this list in the, in
the Rio list and I wasn't down
here, but I don't know the number
exactly, but
it's time for us to
reform Kab Outley.
We can't look
like
we're not getting anything
accomplished in New Mexico,
whether it's a road,
whether it's uh
redevelopment improvement
areas, temperate youth
facilities, youth housing,
it has to get done
and if it can't get done,
then let's move forward and
get it done in a different way. Thank
you. Thank you, Senator Munoz, Senator
Morris to explain his vote. Thank you,  Mr.
President, Senator Munoz
warned my little heart
by saying that he wants some
reform on how we do
that. It is
ridiculous that we have so much
money that we are paying
interest on that's
out there. These
projects are collecting dust.
I about 567
Masam Menos years
ago, stopped doing the
doling out small projects
here and there to all these different
agencies and started going for one
or two large projects
in my district or in Buro
County every year. And that
really helped. And
so what Senator Munoz talked
about reform, the
reform starts with us
and it's up to us as
the legislators to make sure those
projects move along.
I found it really
more beneficial in my
district. And of course, I have an
urban suburban district,
but by doing one big
project really helped
move these things
and having a much better
impact on the quality of life in
my district when I started doing that.
And so I just encourage you all to
just reform yourselves
and stop doing
these little, little doling things
out here and there. I know it's harder for the rural
districts, but it really does
have a bigger impact to get this money
spent in a meaningful way
within your districts and across New
Mexico. So that reform starts
with us. Thank you,  Mr.  President
and Senator Mos. We do have
Senator Tip Pino and Senator
Brantley to explain their
votes.
Thank you, Mister President.
Yes, I, I supported this
because there's a
lot of reasons why the money
doesn't go out of the door. And I
think it would be a huge
mistake for
the Senate Finance Committee
to simply take that position
when there could be very good reasons
why the money isn't going out the
door yet and yet it's
very close. So I would
hope that instead of a
unilateral
decision that there will be no
more reauthorization,
we're going to put a stop to this
terrible problem
that we would take it on a case
by case basis. It just does
not make sense to
put <AAA> blanket
prohibition on
something. A project
that may have cost
estimated to be
$10 million before
the pandemic. And then when
all the other costs came
through has jumped up to
16 or $18
million. If we have
15, why
eradicate that project?
Let's get a few more dollars
in and if it takes another year,
let's get it done. But,
but those
projects apparently
were badly needed. So we put
money into them
and uh there may be a lot
of, of, of, of wasteful
stuff and I noticed a lot of these
riots move the
money from the original intent
to another one. And
that's a, that's a valid
approach, but
to say no more
reauthorization, I think would be a
mistake. I would hope the body wouldn't
take that direction. Thank
you, Senator Subpoena,
Senator Brantley to explain
her vote. Thank you,  Mr.  President. I
think I was alone. No vote in
committee and I vote no again on the
floor today. One with
no disrespect to
Senator Rodriguez who puts a lot
of time into compiling this
list. But for the same
reasons really just to support my
chair in this as we set on
money for far
too long. Tell you that this
year. I'm speaking to
my counties. I refuse to sign
any Rio form. So it's kind
of difficult for a politician in
election year. But some
of these, if you look at this list
are vehicles that have not been,
still have not been purchased in
56 years. There's no
reason for that. When we
allocate the money, they have a
responsibility to
spend the money. But,
but to follow up a little bit of what
Senator Moore's, we as
legislators have a responsibility
to one to follow
through on our junior money
when we leave the session
capital to make sure that
it's getting spent as fast
as possible. And they understand
we're not gonna continue to just put
money at something if they're not
spending the money that they
already have, we
also have the ability to
not author a authorize
reauthorization and
just tell them you have to spend what you have
before we're gonna let you do more.
Um I'm gonna pick on my
largest county here. They've learned
how to kind of milk this system. They'll
have a $3 million project.
Ask me for 200,000.
There's no one else who's allocating
any funding to that and
they're just piece milling these
projects where they have a little bit of
money sitting there for a
project. By the time they're ready to
break ground, it will be twice
as much. And so, so
there's a responsibility on us to
explain to our our constituents
and our counties too, that we're not
funding projects unless we're funding
them in full. Moving
forward. I appreciate my
chair's position on this. I
absolutely agree. It is not fair
to New Mexico to be sitting
on this money and not getting it spent.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Thank
you, Senator Diamond,
Senator Diamond
Brantley,
Senator Rodriguez.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. I move
that senate bill.
Give me a second here.
Make sure I have the the
right? Oh, ok. Thank
you. This is for the next bill,
right? For the? Are we already on
the Capitol? We're done with
this reauthorization bill is going
for you now we have the capital.
So do you want me to start on that,  Mr.
President? Thank
you to the, to the members of the
Senate and precedent. Thank you. We'll
go on to the next
item
and that's gonna be Senate Finance Committee
substitute for Senate Bill 275
as amended with the
emergency clause. Senator
Rodriguez.
Thank you,  Mr.
President,
ask unanimous consent of
the Senate that the records show that all
action for placing.
This is a long
one for placing Senate
Finance Committee, substitute for
Senate Bill. 275 is
amended with the emergency
clause on final passage has been
taken and that it is now
subject to debate amendment or
substitution. There are no objections
Senator Rodriguez to
thank you  Mr.  President. This
is the
statewide
capital outlay bill,
infrastructure bill
itself and it
appropriates
932.2
million in general fund
and 73.5
million in other state funds
and 350 million
in short term severance tax
bonds to more
than 1400
capital projects
statewide. The
bill includes approximately
406 million
for state agencies,
judicial and higher
education projects
and 526
million for local
projects. The
severance tax bonding
authorizations in the bill
include 30 million for
tribal projects
and 323
million for road projects
in fiscal year
25.
The bill also strikes
a requirement for
2023 projects
funded with general fund
to encumber
5% of
appropriations within the
first fiscal
year and
no similar requirement is
included for 2024
projects that
in a nutshell is what this bill
does,  Mr.  President. Thank
you, Senator Rodriguez Senators. We're
debating,
anyone wished the
debate.
See no debate, Senator Rodriguez
to on the bill. Thank you,  Mr.
President. I move
that Senate Finance
Committee substitute for Senate
Bill 275 as
amended with the emergency
clause. Do now pass
and let me get all
this correctly
here.
The record show that the
role has been called in all those present
vote in the affirmative except those voting
in the negative by a show of
hands. Thank you before I call for
the vote I vote, I just want to
remind legislators that if you
do want to explain
your vote, you have to make that
request at the time of your
vote
if you wish to vote. No, please raise
your
hand
by a vote of 36 in the
affirmative zero on the negative Senate
Finance Committee substitute for Senate Bill
275 as
amended has passed with the emergency
clause. Senator Rodriguez.
Thank you,  Mr.  President, members
of the Senate. Thank you, Senator
Rodriguez, Senate majority
floor leader Peter. We take us to the
next order of business.
Uh Thank you,  Mr.  President. So
as I mentioned upfront, we're gonna jump
down to item number 14
House Bill 38 with emergency
clause, GEO bonds. Senator
Rodriguez Aio to Senator
Rodriguez. Thank you.
We're on House Bill 308
with emergency clause, Senator
Rodriguez to explain.
Thank you. Thank you,  Mr.
President. I ask unanimous
consent of the
Senate that the records show that all action
for placing
house bill.
Uh Let me get the number here.
308 on final
passage has been taken and,
and that it is now subject
to debate amendment or substitution
and that this reflected us with the
emergency clause. Thank you,
Senator Rodriguez. See
no objection, Senator
Rodriguez if you'll explain the
bill. Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Um House Bill 38
is our annual or every
two years. We do a bond
issue and
this year the bill started in
the house and
it authored rises the
issuance of general obligation
bond capacity totalling
approximately
289.5
0.6 million for
four bond issues.
Usually the bond GEO
bond is issue
is for higher ed
and senior centres
and schools
and, and libraries
and so on. So 30.4
million for senior citizen
centres is here in
the GEO bond and 19
million for academic,
public school, public and
tribal libraries
statewide. And
229 million for higher
education, special schools
and tribal school
projects and 10 million
for a statewide public safety
radio communication
systems. Usually those
are the projects that come
into the GEO.
But thank
you, Senator Rodriguez Sanders. We're debating
hospital 308 with emergency
clause.
See no debate,
Senator Rodriguez to close.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. I
move that House Bill
308 do now
pass and I ask unanimous
consent of the Senate that the records show
that the role has been called in all those
present vote in the affirmative, except
those voting in the negative
by a show of hands. And I
would like it to reflect
the emergency clause. Thank you,
Senator Rodriguez senators. We are
voting if you
wish to vote. No, please
raise your
hand
by a vote of 39 in the affirmative
zero in the negative House Bill
38 has passed
with the emergency clause. Senator
Rodriguez. Thank you,  Mr.  President,
members of the Senate
Senate majority author Peter
Worth. Take us to the next order of business.
Thank you, Mister President
Unan. We go that our business
announcements and miscellaneous,
there are no objection. We're on that order of
business announcements and miscellaneous,
Senator Wirth. Thank you, Mister President.
So as I mentioned, we're going to do the two
concurrence calendars
and just for the members, since
we'll have these coming down, there
is a concurrent
script in your
desks. It's
similar to putting on a motion
you make the request
for concurrence and then
it debate it and then we take
the vote. So
with that,  Mr.  President Unanimous
consent, we go to that our business
concurrence and I
yield to Senator Duhigg for a
concurrence calendar.
Number one
SD.
Thank you,  Mr.
President. I move
that the Senate concur with
house amendments
to Senate
Bill six.
Thank you. See
no objection. Senator do
to explain the amendment.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
So this
is, this amendment
does really, really
four things overall.
Senator doig if you uh
start that script
over please. It's a Senate Bill
six, not House Bill
six.
I apologize,
Mr.  President, I say House
Bill six. it is
for a Senate judiciary
committee, substitute for Senate
Bill six as twice
amended.
Thank you. See no objections. Senator,
if you'll explain what those amendments
did. Thank you,  Mr.
President. So these amendments really
do four things. First,
it includes cannabis
as contraband in
juvenile detention facilities.
We had already done that for adult
detention facilities in the bill
originally, but
that was an oversight for juvenile ones
as well. It has
a more detailed fix
to, um, the IP a
uh exception
that we had in
that bill, it
puts it re
restores
the
$125,000
cap on license fees that
had been taken out.
And it also restores
the language
that would prohibit legislators from
being cannabis licensees
until, uh, July 1st
2026.
Thank you, Senator Duhigg
Senators. We're debating the
concurrence
of House of
Senate Bill six amendments
and Senator
Baca followed by Senator
Pirtle. Senator
Pirtle. Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Well, the sponsor of the
concurrence yield. Thank you,
Senator, yes,
mister President. What
was that last part? Mister
President
Senator Mister President,
Senator the House put back
in the prohibition on legislators
being cannabis licensees
until January 1st
2026. Thank
you, Senator Pirtle and thank you,
Mister President. Did they address
anything to do with anybody else
that works within
cannabis or can work related
to cannabis,
either attorneys or
anyone in that
regard?
Senator  Mr.
Cannabis
Point of order point of
order,  Mr.
President, Senator
Cannabis,
Mister President.
No, this
only deals with folks who are
licensed licensees
under the cannabis regulation
Act,
Senator Pirtle.
And thank you,  Mr.  President. Can you
tell me anywhere else in law
that we restrict
what legislators can do
outside in their uh
private business or
private enterprise?
Um
Any, any section
of law where we, we restrict
what, what we can do?
Senator  Mr.  President,
Senator, I mean, certainly the
governmental conduct act
includes restrictions on what legislators
can do but as
far as other
legislation specific to
individual industries.
No, Senator
Pirtle and Mister President
and Senator,
are there any members
of the legislature
currently
employed or on
contract
with any
company that has anything to
do with cannabis.
And Senator Perell, Senator
Mr.  President,
Senator, this
prohibition is specific to
cannabis licensees. I
don't believe there's any members of the
legislature who are cannabis
licensees as that prohibition
is current law. Thank
you, Senator Digg, Senator Pirtle
and Mister President Senator, are
there any members of
the legislature that have
any contracts or
work outside of
the licensee
umbrella currently? Are
there any legislators that have any
contracts with cannabis
companies that we know of?
Thank you, Senator Pertell, Senator
Duhigg, Mister
President, Senator.
You, I think you would have to
ask all the members of the
legislature about
that
dinner, Purtle and thank you,  Mr.
President. I think that's a hypocrisy
that, that we're dealing with, with
this. I don't
understand
why. I mean, I know
it made the original
Senator that put it in feel
better about himself for
putting it in there that somehow,
you know, there were members including
Mr.  President, including yourself that
might make
money off of this industry
and that somehow
we were protecting the
public or showing
or, or
um basically
pontificating that, that we
were gonna ensure people weren't gonna make,
make money off of this new industry.
And it's, it's just
surprising to me that
the House would put it back in.
It's bad policy.
Um I don't
know of anybody that's going to
attempt to be a licensee.
It's just a bad precedent
that, that we're putting into law. I would
actually, um
think that  Mr.  President
and Senator, you would move not to
concur go into conference.
There's plenty of time.
Um, just to
clear up some of this, I, I
don't think that this is something
that, that should, should remain
in law. Um, and
hopefully moving forward,
this doesn't happen again.
Um, because there are plenty of people
making money off of cannabis
currently that, that the news
fails to report on.
I don't know if they're just asleep up
there if they're even present,
but there's already legislators
making tons of money off of the
cannabis industry and
don't have to have licenses
to do so.
Thank you, Senator Pirtle, Senator
Steinborn.
Thank you, Mister President. Will the Senator
yield for a question
yield, Mister President?
Thank you, Mister President, Senator. Well, it's
good to, I haven't looked at it but
it's good to hear the I pra got
worked on more because it sounded,
I think it needed it probably.
But my question is,
and you didn't say it, but did
they do anything on the drive-through
issue or
is the, is the ban
on drive-through effectively
no longer in this bill?
Senator  Mr.  President,
Senator, no, nothing
was done on that issue
because it had been taken out of the bill
here in the Senate.
That's all I have. Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Thanks. So thank you
Senator Steinborn, Senator Morris.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. I
also hope the body
doesn't concur regarding this
lic issue. It doesn't make
sense. It's the only
area of law
that we do that.
And
no, and no part of
government loves self
flagellation more than the
legislature. We do
it all the time. The
executive doesn't do it. The,
the, the amendment doesn't say
that the executive can't go into
the cannabis industry
afterwards. The
amendment didn't say that
you can't be a supplier
to the cannabis industry.
It didn't say that you can't
be a lawyer to the cannabis industry.
It didn't say that you can be a
truck driver for the cannabis
industry. It just
you can be a worker
at one of the places.
You just can't have a license.
I know um this
body uh loves to, to
beat ourselves up and put
all sorts of regulations on us to
think that we're somehow
doing good government. In fact, this
is bad government. Uh This is
bad government uh to
be able to uh
people's livelihood.
You can be a dental hygienist. You
can be a li lawyer for
goodness knows there's a lot of lawyers
in here who have license to
practice. Um
you can have oil wells,
you can have everything else.
Um You have licensed business
owners, we have doctors, we have
all those industries.
Um And when you have a citizen
legislature, you're gonna have those kind of
conflicts and to
specifically specifically
say this one industry
that you all decided
was clean and
we should have people in
it. Um uh
So for somehow it's too dirty
for legislators to be in it.
And that doesn't make sense. Uh
It doesn't make sense at all. So I hope
we do not concur,
there's plenty of time to have a conference
committee on this.
Um, I believe the drive up
windows, people are going to
die.  Mr.  President, people are
going to die before this body
takes action on the drive up windows
just like we did with alcohol. And
that's a shame but that, that ship
has sailed for now. So I hope someone
takes that banner up next
year and moves that forward. It's
probably gonna take 10 or 15 years
and a number of people are going to die
because they drive up windows.
But, you know, we're going
to wait for the evidence, I guess, but that
means people are going to be dead.
Um, but I do hope we don't
concur to this and,
um, we take it to the house and
say that this is just bad
policy in the future
because next year it's gonna be
another industry. We're gonna
say lawyers can't have a
license and serve in the
legislature. We're gonna say that
high school football or baseball
coaches can't serve
and that would be a shame. Also,  Mr.
President, um, so I
hope we don't do not concur for
this and we don't set this precedent
again. Thank you,  Mr.  President
and Senator Morris, Senator
Munoz.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Will he sponsor
yield. Senator.
Yes,  Mr.  President  Mr.  President
Senator, I think this is an agency
bill that started. Is the agency
still in support of this bill?
Senator De  Mr.
President, Senator. Yes.
Thank you, Senator, Senator
and  Mr.  President Senator, they
support everything in the bill or
do they not like amendments
that got put on? I'm trying to figure
this out because I look
for the, the agency
director and I don't see them anywhere. I just
want to see if they're on board or not on
board. Thank you, Senator.
When you Senator
Mr.  President, Senator,
uh yes, they, they are
on, on board with the bill.
They are ok with the amendments.
Uh and they
believe this is an important bill that needs
to pass Senator
Munoz. Thank you,  Mr.
President. Thank
you, Senator
Pope.
Thank you, Mister President.
No need for
the sponsor to yield.
I just support
Concurrence and I hope
the body does as well. I'm glad
to see the prohibition put
back in, you
know, as a body. I understand folks
are worried about the precedents
and what's happening here,
but I don't believe we're going
down a wrong path. And
so I would just
ask the body to support
this. We are legislators.
We can't be involved
in every business. We're not trying to
ban those. And,
you know, I didn't think of it last time
in the debate, but you
know, servi us serving
in the legislature, we cannot be
lobbyists. So there are
some things that we cannot do.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Thank you,
Senator
Pope
seeing no further debate.
Senator
Duh,
thank you,  Mr.  President.
I move that the Senate
concur with the House amendments
to Senate Judiciary
Committee substitute for Senate
Bill six as twice amended
and I ask for a show of
hands.
Thank you, Senator. There's been a
request for the Senate
to concur with
the house amendments. The Senate
Judiciary Committee substitute for Senate Bill
six is twice amended if you wish to
vote. No, please raise your
hand. Senator
Branton voting. No,
Senator Moore is voting.
No,
Senator Woods
voting. No
senator Baca voting.
No senator
share voting. No
Senator Pirtle
voting. No
Senator Brantley voting.
No, Senator
Sanchez voting. No
Senator Gallegos
Vono. Senator
Burt voting.
No
Senator mccutcheon voting.
No Senator
Tallman voting. No,
Senator Munoz
voting. No
Senner Cervantes
Bodino,
Senator Nibert voting.
No, Senator
Neville voting.
No,
Senator Shino voting.
No
by a vote of 22. In the affirmative
17 in the negative.
The Senate has concurred with
house amendments to Senate judiciary
committee. Substitute for
Senate Bill six is twice amended.
Senator Duh
president, Senator Deh, I apologize, Senator
Morris to explain his vote. Thank
you,  Mr.  President. The issue came
up that lobbyists aren't allowed
to be legislators. That's not
true. There are lobbyists
who are legislators.
Lobbyists are probably
right there on the respect
level below legislators
and used car salesmen,
but they're clean enough to serve
in the legislature and we have
lobbyists in the legislature
and have for many, many years.
But now this industry
that's supposed to be wholesome and clean
is not allowed to be a legislator.
Makes no sense. Mister
President Senator
Di, thank you, Mister
President. Thank you. We're going to go on
to the next item,
Senator Peor.
Thank you, Mister President. I
move the Senate concur
to the House amendment to
Senate judiciary committee,
substitute for Senate Bill
five as
previously
amended.
See, no objection, Senator Wirth, if you'll
explain. Thank
you,  Mr.  President. I really
hoped I could have had Senator
Moores on a conference committee
one last time.
But this amendment
basically is one,
we discussed a lot in committee
and on the floor, it does
add in exception
on the polling places,
firearms ban
for a person carrying a
concealed
firearm.
And again, well,
I have some heartburn with this.
I respect the
process
and I do appreciate that.
It will certainly generate
a few more Republican votes on
the other side. Now that this amendment
is on, I saw that commitment
earlier, but that's what it does.
So again, I would just
respectfully ask the
Senate to
concur.
Thank you, Senator
Baca. Thank
you,  Mr.  President. It's really
amazing how
an idea that originates
on this side
goes to the other side
gets flipped around.
Now, it's a Democrat
idea. And now it
makes
sense
fascinating
if I had a dollar for every
time I've seen
that happen in this
chamber.
Well, let's just say I'd be retiring
too.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Thank
you, Senator Baca. Senator Brand,
Senator Pirtle,
Senator Morris. Thank you,
Mr.  President. The burden of
governing must be really
hard. The weight
that on the shoulders of
those who govern here, it's just
overbearing.
I hope we don't concur
with the house. I mean, how
dare they, how
dare they, this was a well thought
out bill, we
were told concealed carries
in, in polling places
was dangerous. It was going to lead to
fights and fist fights and
shootouts and, and,
and guys are going to come around and show
their guns and it's going to suppress
votes. This
and the house
allows concealed carry
into polling places. How
dare they, how
dare they, the lower
chamber not
yield to the wisdom
of the upper house.
So I hope we don't concur
because we heard time and
again, a
very distinguished handsome
senator and
two different committees introduced
a an amendment, this
exact same language.
And then even on the floor, that same
handsome articulate senator
spoke in
favour of this language
and we were told that it was going to lead to
chaos. It was gonna suppress
votes. And you know what,
I think we need to tell the house
that we're not going to concur
to their, they're trying to ram this
down our throat in the last minute
and we send it back to them
because this is obviously
dangerous. We were told this is
dangerous. We're told the committee was
dangerous twice. We're told
on the floor this year. Last
year, we were told it was dangerous
and goodness this is
going to lead to mass
chaos in the streets and
around polling locations if
we do it, that's what we were told. So
I hope we don't relent
and we stand to
as a body against the
tyranny of the lower
house. We got plenty
of time to go to conference committee and I want to
go to conference committee. I think I get
an extra per diem day if I
do it, I was told that.
So maybe we can do
that, Mister Mister President,
Senator Wirth. But
let's not endanger
our elections by accepting
these amendments. Thank
you,  Mr.  President. Thank you, Senator Moore, Senator
Pirtle and thank you  Mr.
President and thank you
Senator Morris for those compliments.
I knew I was handsome. I didn't know I was
articulate, but I
do appreciate that.
Will the sponsor of the
bill and the concurrence motion
yield, Mister President
Mr.  President, I do Senator
Pirtle and thank you, Mister President.
Do you know the current
processing times to
get a concealed carry
license and, and
if the Department of Public
Safety is struggling to keep
up with demand currently?
Thank you Senator Pirtle, Senator
Wirth,  Mr.  President. I don't
off the top of my head but happy to be
educated,
Mr.  President. I don't, I, I have
heard rumblings that, that
they're struggling. Um
They've lost a few
key people to do
that. So I think as
we move forward, we really need to as
a state uh probably
next year in the appropriation
bill, put some money,
their direction. Um as
we're, as we're creating this
special class of gun
owner. Um I, I
do think that a lot of people,
including myself,
I'll be rushing out to get my concealed
carry, not so that I can take a fire
into a polling place. I'm, I'm not really
sure. Um, this is even
necessary. But, um,
you know, I think as we, as we've
identified that that's a, a
class of gun owner
that, that we know is
responsible and is gonna have a little
bit of a special privilege.
Um, I think we need to take a
long hard look at Department of
Public Safety, their processing
times and what we can do
to improve that. Thank you,  Mr.
President. Thank you, Senator
Perle, Senator
Cervantes.
Thank you,  Mr.  President  Mr.  President. You know,
Senator Moore's
said he urges it
not to concur and
II, I really do have to think about
this and, you know, there's a
lot of goodna ribbing
that's going on. Um,
and a little bit of I told you
so and that's all
good,
but I want to pause
just a moment to recognize this is
one of only two gun
bills this
session that looks like
it might have a chance of being signed
into law.
And
let's be very frank.
We don't have a problem with
guns in polling
places.
I don't know of any shooting that's taken
place in a polling place. And
I don't, I don't know really,
I guess there's been some people that show up
at polling locations
carrying guns that may be
intimidating to some people
but, but this
is not a big problem and this is,
this is
not
part of a, of really
what should be a serious conversation
about gun violence in our
state.
This is, this is not a big
problem and the, and the fact
that we're gonna
make a little bit of fun
of the process
and the fact that the house is
maybe, uh, rolling
over us these days
seemingly with
this and many other bills.
Um, I
think it's important that we, that we
take the humour and
the, and the good nature
ribbing that we're doing here on the floor
to take a moment to realize we
really didn't do very much this
session on guns.
I appreciate the good debate
on Saturday. The seven day waiting period
is an important piece of legislation. I
think I know there's disagreement
about that, but at least it's,
it begins to talk about the
seriousness but, but let's
not, let's not
get too excited
about what we have
accomplished.
And so now we've, we've,
we've banned guns employing places
unless you have a concealed carry permit.
So,
what have we really accomplished?
Guys, women, men,
ladies of the
Senate. I hope, I
hope we'll ask ourselves that when we go home
tomorrow,
this, this is not
something we should sit here
and tell ourselves we've done a
lot in, in
doing.
And I,
I'm still thinking
hard about whether to concur best
on this or not. Because
again, if we ban guns from pulling
places, unless you have a permit to
not have your guns
banned on pulling places.
Where are we, where are we at?  Mr.
President? Thank you and
Senator about to see no further
debate,
Senator Wirth, thank
you,  Mr.  President. I appreciate
Senator Moore's expressing
all of my frustrations
and the importance of this bill
and, and I respectfully
disagree with
my good friend from
Dona County. Senator
Cervantes. I think
having guns in polling places
with the election cycle we're going
into is an
incredible
important issue to be discussing.
And what we're doing here is
very important. No
longer. Will you be able to carry
long rifles
into polling
places? You won't
be able to basically
have weapons
that are exposed and
intimidating and yes, there's a
concealed carry exception.
What I prefer that this not
be on there. I'm not going to
say I wouldn't, but I still
think this is a very important
bill when you put it into the
mix given the election
cycle, we are going into
president. I move that the
Senate concur with
the house changes. The Senate
judiciary committee substitute
for Senate Bill five as
amended and I would ask for
a voice
vote.
There's been a request for a voice
vote. I'm
happy to do a show of hands.
There's been a change of request for a show of
hands.
Senators, we're being asked to concur
with the house amendments, the Senate judiciary
committee. Substitute for Senate Bill five is
twice amended. If you
wish to vote against the
concurrence,
please raise your
hand
my
over
by a vote of 37 in the affirmative
zero in the negative. The Senate
has concurred to house amendments for
Senate Judiciary
committee. Substitute for Senate Bill
five is twice amended. Senator
Moore, you're on the clock.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. How long do I
have? Two minutes? Three minutes, three
minutes.
Obviously, I was being
a little facetious as Senator
Savana said,
I, this is
something I had told
the, the majority leader
that I was willing to do from the
very beginning that I
wanted to be able to the
last couple of years, be able
to do a bipartisan
election and a gun
bill. To me, that was
important. And although
my amendments were not taken
before, I wish they had been
because this bill would have sailed through
a long time ago. But
I made that commitment. I think
this is the right thing to do in this
environment as Senator we
said, and I just
want you guys to pause in the
majority. Think about
this majority if
you can gavel down. Listen,
we just pass an election
bill and a gun bill
unanimously
in the new Mexico State Senate.
So the burden of governance
isn't just on one party
here and we work together,
we can actually come together
and do things much
better. So those of you
on the other side, who just want to
ignore the minority when we have
expertise and knowledge and
business experience. Just
because you think it's a burden to govern
without us, think of how much
better it will be in years to
come if you actually listen and
work with the, the numbers on
this side. And so I've made
that commitment. I think this is a
really interesting bill for, for
elections and guns to
be bipartisan in this day and
age. And I am proud
that we just did that. And I hope
you guys learn that lesson on
both sides of the aisle. When work
together, things get done around
here. Thank you,  Mr.  President. Thank you, Senator
Morris. Senator Brand. Did you
raise your hand to explain your vote? Was that
Senator Pirtle? Senator
Pirtle?
Thank you,  Mr.  President. And
obviously I, I was gonna support
Concurrence. Um
But I think for me,
Mr.  President, members of the body that
the part that I think
uh struck me the
most is we had an opportunity
on the senate floor
to, to have a bipartisan
vote. We've
had, we've had some votes the
last couple of nights that have caused
quite the division in this
chamber and it was
offered up to the body
when this amendment was offered
on this floor, that it would be
a bipartisan bill.
And, and again, we're shown
that
there's no desire
to have bipartisan
compromise
that myself,
Senator Moores, maybe even a
handful Moore would have been
willing if we have put
concealed carry
in
to support the
bill.
And it's just unfortunate it comes
back with Senator
Moore's great idea
and someone else champ
championing victory
after three attempts.
Um that, uh
you know, it's gonna be
bipartisan for the concurrence
instead of for the original
legislation is which it should
have is how it should have
left this body.  Mr.  President. Thank
you.
Thank you, Senator Pirtle Senator,
when you asked to explain this. Thank
you,  Mr.  President. I, I don't know if I violated
the law already because I have
a Valentine's present with a
gun.
Thank you, Senator
Munoz,
Senator Wirth. Uh
Thank you,  Mr.  President.

hour break.
Uh, so we'll be back at 1230.
I know some committees want to meet during
this little window.
Um, so I would yield
to committee chairs and I also know
Senator Jamille has an announcement
and some guests to introduce. Uh,
now is the time to do it. Thank
you, Senator Wirth
Mr.  President. On this Los
Alamos County Day, you can't
hide my hilltop or
pride. And so the
government class from Los
Alamos High School is joining me
in the gallery along with teachers
and parents. If they can rise,
I, I was gonna sing the
fight song and I might just say
go topers,
go for
the green and for
the gold, they can
finish it for us, but they're all up
there. And then right behind me
is a program
manager. One of my good friends
who works for us at Los
Alamos National Laboratory
as a program manager. He's
responsible and helping with legacy
clean up with one of the
contractors to Los Alamos National
Laboratory. So, ladies and gentlemen
of the Senate, if you can help me in welcoming
Los Alamos high school
students and my good friend, Jonathan
to the
Senate.
Thank you, Senator Jlo. Any
further announcements?
Senators,
Senator Cervantes,
Mr.  President, I think we're going to, I'm
going to wait to hear from the majority leader about
the schedule, but probably
going to announce a judiciary
committee here shortly.
So let me wait to hear some of
the other announcements, but we'll
be scheduling a judiciary committee meeting
here shortly. Thank you, Senator
Cervantes Seor. So  Mr.
President, I did announce Senator
Cervantes. We're, we're going to take
a two hour break, so we'll be back at
1230. So
that's the window to make
an announcement. Thank you,
majority leader. So, yeah, so the
judiciary, we will go in at 11. Uh,
so all members please take note. We
still got three items that we're gonna try and take
care of between 11 and
1230. So for a quick
prompt on time, we'll get the work done
in that window. Thank you. Thank
you, Senator Cervantes. Any further
announcements? Senator
Munoz?
Thank you,  Mr.  President. You know, I
move that judiciary do not
meet they've sent
enough stuff to the floor
that's not very good for anybody.
Uh, so I, I
make that motion to the body that
we do not meet.
Uh,  Mr.  President Senate Finance
will be at the call of the chair. We had
one bill come in. We're
going to look at, look at it and,
and have a,
at the call of the chair,
Mr.  President. Thank you, Senator
Munoz, Senator Ortiz
Aino. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. The Senate
Health and Public Affairs Committee
has one bill on
our calendar and we'll meet at
11 o'clock in room
311 to deal with that.
Thank you. So, Senator
Montes, thank you,  Mr.  President  Mr.  President. You know,
I appreciate the Senate finance
chair's suggestion. The body
that's a judiciary committee not meet
one of the bills we'll be hearing in the
window is on artificial
intelligence. And
Mr.  Chairman, I've heard that
described very times for the
chairman of the finance committee
to have artificial
intelligence
and I think he's just appreciative,
have the word Senate
finance chair Munoz and
intelligence in the same sentence
at all. So, so
Mr.  President, I think it'll be
important for Senate
Judiciary committee to meet so we can
talk about artificial
intelligence and as it may be
helpful with Senator Munoz
to continue doing his job. Thank
you,  Mr.  President.
You know,  Mr.  President, I want to give my
box to Senator
Cervantes so he can
put something in the box for
me. Thank you, Senator
Munoz. Senator
Pirtle, thank you,
Mr.  President. If, if
Senator Munoz had paid
attention, all he had to do was yield
to Senator Scher
and we could learn about baseball
and I'm pretty sure he could talk long
enough to get back to that
1230 window.  Mr.
President. Thank you,
Senator Purtle
seeing no further announcements.
Oh, Senator Branley,
thank you,  Mr.  President. You know,
for the last four Valentine's
Day, I've had
14,
Valentines 16 with
our staff. I
am, I am so
lucky to serve
when a caucus of gentlemen
who treat me as
an equal, respect
me as an equal,
expect things from
me equally and
participation, but honour
me as a, as a woman.
And there is no
greater day of the year time of the
year than Valentine's Day when that
is on full display. I want to thank
Senator Sanchez, Senator Pirtle
Flowers from my entire
caucus. Um Look,
I think that we all have, you know,
God given roles
and interests and, and
while we may share those across the
board, the reality is on Valentine's
Day, there's probably a greater interest
for ladies and I just want to
thank them for always recognizing
that for spoiling on this
day and then turning
around and, and debating and,
and having high expectations
as they would of anyone else. So, thank you,
gentlemen this this day and
always thank you Senator Brantley,
Senator Morris
Mr.  President, Senator
Brantley. We are hardly
your equal.
Thank you, Senator Morris.
Senator. See no
further
announcement, Senator Wirth.
Uh thank you,  Mr.  President. So
again, we'll be back at 1230
just, just for everyone watching
at this point, uh, when
bills do come out of committee
kind of at this stage,
uh, we roll the clock
and we'll put them on a supplemental
calendar. So we will,
I'll do my best to
again work with Senator
Baca and just the
other members on the floor to
let everyone know what's gonna
happen. Uh We'll probably
have a kind of
mid-afternoon session perhaps,
take another break and then
see where we are later this
evening. So with that,  Mr.  President Unanimous
consent, the Senate stand in recess until
1230 this
afternoon. See no objection.
The Senate will stand in recess until
12:30 p.m. today.
