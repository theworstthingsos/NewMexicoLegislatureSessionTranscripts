my fourth year in the Senate.
Happy to be here.
Thank you, Madam Chair. My name
is Debbie Sinan. I represent
house District 21 in Ben Yo

area and happy to be here. How's
Good morning, madam Chair, Uh,
rest of the committee. Um
Senator Harold Pole junior
Senate Majority Caucus chair
representing Senate District 23
Northwest Albuquerque, Bernal,
Leo County.
Happy to be here.
Madam Chair colleagues. Good
morning, state Senator Jeff
Steinborn from Dona County where
we grow your chili.
And, uh,
Celebrating the 10 year
anniversary of the Organ
Mountain Desert Peaks National
Monument.
That's my district. Thank you
very much.
Representative Christine
Chandler from Los Alamos. Happy
to be here, Madam chair and good
to see all of you.
Morning, Madam Chair. I'm state.
Rep. Catherine Brown from
portions. I represent portions
of Eddie and Lee County.
And I've been on this committee.
Congratulations.
Um
I'm representative Joanne
Ferrari. And, um, chair of this
committee. I'm from Dona County.
Uh, Las Cruces and my district
is on the Northeast side.
So
Welcome everyone in our, um So,
uh, first on our agenda.
Is, uh, to discuss. Um
The, UM suggested I'm not sure
where I left it.
There it is.
Uh, our work proposed work plan.
And and the dates that on the
last sheet.
Of when, uh and where we are
planning to meet, and if anyone
has any other discussion
Um how, uh do we include what
everyone might have sent in or
there are other things that we
need to add?
Everything was great, but I
mean, uh, are there other things
People would like to, uh, look
over the list. Make sure all of
your, uh ideas and concerns that
we should cover during this
interim are included.
The monitoring of drinking
water.
Oh, I did not.
Maybe it got picked up. Um, yes,
And I think as part of that,
too, Um, we should have, um,
include the schools because
there's a lot of federal money
that will, um
Replace or include, UM
A special, um
Water dispensers so that kids
can drink.
Filtered. Be sure they're not
In their water.
And
Hurt their brains cause they
need everything they can.
That all the healthy anything
else? Yes.
Thank you, Madam Chair can we
add as far as water? Um
Try to get, uh, see if we can
get an idea of how much water is
being fresh water is being used
for fracking and, um
To produce water is being used
or or created and where it's
going.
OK?
Do we not have that included in
something else?
Oh, I'm sorry. I also Daf, um,
introduce themselves.
We couldn't do this with
Um all Enock. Uh, this is my
first year.
Um and I'm very glad to be here,
but also glad to have Tom's
assistance working on this.
And the rest of your staff.
Uh, yes, then.
Madam chair. I'd like to add to
this and we kind of speak to it
a little bit, But, um
A, uh ask en MEDNMED to talk to
us about a proposed
Um clean up clean up fund.
For New Mexico contaminated
sites.
And would that be leveraging?
Uh, lawsuits Federal law.
Um, the funding sources to
remediate and could look like
different things.
It just depends.
That we would just have that,
um, fund.
Ready to put money into part of
part of what we need to do is
assess sites. We have 300 they
But on a presentation here last
year we have 3/300 abandoned and
neglected, hazardous
contaminated sites around the
state.
Everything from old dry cleaners
to old gas stations. They exist
in most towns.
Lands not being put to
productive use.
And so what? Uh, what they've
suggested, is that we need to
start identifying those sites.
Those that are super fund
eligible. Get them on that
track, but otherwise we have a
lot of one time money. What a
perfect opportunity to start to
clean up all these contaminated
sites in New Mexico. Some of
them are threats to groundwater.
So that's also part of what
they're looking at.
But, uh then you know you can
get into abandon.
Uranium mine sites and oil and
gas sites, but
Uh, just depends how much money
we wanna put into it. But the
whole issue of cleaning up of
contaminated sites and
A fund and
Trying to get support for
putting money into clean up.
OK, that's great. I would just
say enemy.
Clean up of contaminated sites.
That's B.
Is that
Included in that could we look
at models where the industries
are helping to pay instead of
New Mexico tax
Is there some work in that arena
as well?
Yeah, these are If there's a
known responsible party, we
should not be paying for them.
To clean up these sites.
Well, presumably, they're known
In most cases.
Um, no, They're not always. No,
I mean, like, in the case of the
abandoned uranium mine sites.
Maybe they were known at one
time, but they're out of
business.
They don't exist. Those legal
entities do not exist. That's
why they call him abandoned
uranium mine sites because
they're entities that were stood
up to mind this uranium years
and years ago, they literally
went away.
And there is
I know it sounds crazy, but
there is not a, uh, and the
words responsible party is or
their legal words that they use.
It's not my words, but that's
what they call them.
So, yeah. Where there is a
responsible party.
They obviously should be the one
paying
Right?
So I'll leave it at that. And
let them explain it. Thank you.
Thank you. And, um, did that
answer OK?
And, uh, representative Surana.
I think J the produced water.
OK, I have another one, Madam
chair. Um you know, we have all
these acts that allow gas and
oil to be excluded from
radioactive waste and hazardous
waste. And maybe we do a deep
dive or look at that to have
someone explain the A and see
what? Um, because they are
excluded from a lot of
Hazardous things and we need to
figure out why and if we need to
still have that exclusion
anyway, that's it. Thank you.
And so we will add that I don't
see it being covered.
Well interim storage of nuclear
materials.
Yeah,
Where
A G.
OK, great.
Thank you.
All right. Anything else?
Anyone? OK? If if something else
comes up, Um, how about by
Friday? Um, you could let
Paul? No.
And we'll send out an email to
other committee members. Uh
OK, now we can look at the dates
and locations and
We, um did have these grouped
Um, kind of together.
And I
I don't remember that,
Uh yes.
I think we had them.
In order.
Oh, good.
Thank you.
So our first meeting today we
have the second meeting we
thought we'd do in Gallup. Um,
since August, is kind of a hot
month Gallop is further north.
So Yeah. Where isn't it? You
know, except here, um
OK, we went there last year,
right? And it was a great trip.
Um, So for Gallup we're looking
at
A through E.
And now, um through F because
the derailment of the train that
was so close to gal, so this
would be a through F would be
gallop.
And
The 2nd 3rd meeting, I guess, uh
to Hobbs would include the
interim storage of nuclear
materials. Um, update of uranium
enrichment. Um, the poly? Uh,
the PFAs in drilling, fluids and
contamination. Canon Air Force
Base produce water and water
reuse setbacks from oil and gas
operations and, uh, the US
department so
That
Department of Energy Clean
Energy Project at UM, Whip
So that would go to S.
G, Dr S.
OK, I started to write on
And then we will add in the
other.
Um, well, we can do that,
Probably in the one of the later
ones. Um, the fourth meeting, Um
Kirtland Air Force Base.
Uh, the fuel leak cleanup.
Uh, which I don't see on here.
Oh, there it is. It's N.
So and will be moved to Alma
Gordo. Well,
And
For the fourth meeting in Alma
Gorda. We can include an
And then and then.
Oh, so wait. This might be clean
up.
OK, I think it should have been
G through L. We stopped there.
OK, I kind of got ahead of that.
And then, um
OK, that will be in Hobbs.
And
Oh, that's
M through P. OK, M through P
will be in and then
Q.
For the rest.
Will be in Santa Fe.
Through X.
Yes.
OK and then
The cleanup fund.
Probably add to
Alma Gordo.
Does that seem like a good place
to add that Oh, OK.
OK,
alright. We'll just, uh wait for
where that's going to be, and
that's good. Any other
suggestions or changes to that?
Did that make sense?
So our first meeting in Gallup
will be a through F.
Yes.
The testing.
That
Chair.
You're OK. I have a suggestion.
There's two of them that refer
to the Poly I and then there's
also
OK, I, um, saw that in a
different place.
So yes, it is. It would be. Yes,
I'm sure I might recommend. We
put that now in the Gordo
because of what happened at all
and earth was done.
Um
Testing, wildlife and whatnot. I
mean, it's a very local issue to
them.
Just like we did PF and clover.
Very local to that community.
It's big deal everywhere, but
Yes. And then maybe we can have
those folks.
Present G through L is supposed
to be
Oh, but you're saying move it to
Alma Gordo instead of Hobbs.
That particular issue? Yeah.
Well and then also the, UM
White sand that was being of
concern.
OK?
And we can also discuss at that
time. Um with the federal
government has changed.
Levels.
That they've changed and also
How they are, Um
Hopefully getting closer to, um
Settlement.
With, um, Office and natural
resources trust, OK?
Does.
That seemed to cover everything
All the changes anyone chair. Um
do you think we could have a a
revised copy sent to us by
email.
That would be helpful. I hope
so. Cause if I had to go by my
notes,
Thank you. Yes.
We will do that.
And we can catch the rest of the
members that weren't able to be
here up and then see if they
have any other changes to and
we'll get the locations in group
them together, so you can see
those if you have any objections
in the next couple of days. We
can work that out. That's great.
Thank you. That'll keep us
organized and
Know what What's coming up?
OK?
Hey, seeing no other
recommendations or changes.
That's great. Appreciate that,
Um, while we're at it, Um, it's
10 o'clock. Oh, not quite, um,
just for people who, um, might
be on zoom. Um I just wanted to
let you know that you know, uh,
we're planning on the at the end
of the, uh, committee meeting
around two o'clock, um, for
public comment. We might move
that up if we
I had a schedule before lunch or
not. But members of the public
may provide comments in person
or virtually during the public
comment period and a person
wishing to make virtual public
comment can find instructions
and the link to the zoom webinar
on the water and Natural
Resources Committee's Web page
at NM legis legis.gov.
And while in the zoom Webinar
turn off the Webcast to avoid
technical interference when it's
your time to speak.
And during the public comment
period, a person in the zoom
Uh Webinar, who wants to make
public comment will type their
name into the chat.
And then when the person is
called upon to make public
comment, their microphone will
be unmuted.
So hopefully, um, that helps,
um for people to know when we
get to, um, virtual public
comment.
Oh, thank you.
Um, I need to have a motion. Um,
and vote to accept the work
plan, Do we?
Thank you.
OK, it's been moved by Senator
Steinborn and seconded by
representative OK, So moved.
Thank you.
OK?
So
Believe it or not, We're right
on time now. Yeah, We're six
minutes ahead. Um
So do we have? Oh, we do. Thank
you. Um Alisha Trujillo is, uh,
going to present an overview of
energy, minerals and natural
resources departments
regulation related to
radioactive and hazardous
materials. Um, thank you, Chief
Trujillo. We appreciate your
taking time out today.
Good morning, madam Chair
members of the committee. It's
good to be back.
I am Eita Trujillo and I am the
bureau chief over hazardous
waste planning at energy,
minerals and natural resources.
And I oversee the whip
transportation program and all
other activities related to
radioactive material and some
nuclear fuel.
In the state of New Mexico in
and through the state of New
Mexico. You have a presentation
before you.
That I'll briefly go over. I'm
not gonna take much of your
time.
Um, First of all, ner does not
have any regulatory authority
over radioactive or nuclear
materials in the state of New
Mexico, which is a good thing
because I don't want to regulate
radioactive or nuclear material.
Um, but the Cabinet secretary is
the current designee and the
chair of the radioactive hazard
material or radioactive Waste
Consultation Task Force and
appointed by the governor.
Is this too loud cause I feel
like I'm like it's right in my
face.
Is that better?
Is that better?
OK?
Um, I am the
Cabinet secretaries designee and
I am a member of the following
committees. I am an active
member of the National Governors
Association, Federal facilities
Task Force. Um, it's a committee
designated and funded through
DOE to look at and help develop
policies as it relates to
federal facilities across the
nation that deal with
radioactive material and nuclear
materials.
I'm also a member of the
Department of Energy's Nuclear
Energy Office, Rail routing ad
hoc working group. That working
group Um, looks at, uh, existing
policies or helps to develop
policies and processes as it
relates to the rail and routing
of spent nuclear fuel across the
nation.
Um, I'm a member of the
Department of Energy's national
Transportation Stakeholders
Forum Planning Committee. The
committee meets annually. Um
The The overall conference is an
annual meeting this year in
Denver, Colorado, and the
Planning committee helps
organize that annual conference,
along with other working ad hoc
working groups.
The Department of Energy,
Nuclear Energy. Um 1 80 C ad hoc
working group That's section 1
80 C of the Nuclear Waste Policy
Act and that deals with
potential funding for rail
transportation of spent nuclear
fuel for communities and tribes
that may be impacted by the
transport of that material
across the nation. And then I am
the co-chair of the Western
Interstate Energy Board, High
level Radioactive Waste
Committee and the technical
advisory group.
Work with
Very active.
Um, the radioactive Voice
Consultation task force was
updated in our last legislative
session. The members of that
committee are now Secret
Secretary Kender dy of energy,
minerals, Natural resources.
Secretary Kenny from the
Environment Department Secretary
Allen from Department of Health
Secretary Cerna from DOT,
Secretary Bowie from public
safety.
And General Aguilar is currently
overseeing Department of
Homeland Security and emergency
management.
And Secretary Joseph Monet of
Indian Affairs, and we added the
state Land Commissioner
Stephanie Garcia, Richard and
then the state Fire Marshal.
Randy Varela is our um, non
voting member but an active part
of our
Um, task force itself.
Within that task force. Um, they
met last in October of 23.
And we developed a or stood up
an advisory committee to look at
The at the time was the whole
tech license and any other
potential consolidated interim
storage facility licenses that
may have come through by the
NRC. Um, it was an opportunity
for us to develop a committee to
look at the impacts that those
licenses may have on New Mexico
as you know, or
Hopefully, you do know that the
fifth Circuit held up that NRC
license and there's a potential
for it to go to the Supreme
Court for review.
Um so we're monitoring that
active Actively. But one of the
other things that, um came about
if you weren't aware is
Department of Energy's Nuclear
Energy office received record of
decision or critical decision
zero.
To look at
Or to begin the process of
reviewing a site for a federal
site for consolidated Interim
storage of spent nuclear fuel.
So it's the very first step of
the federal government
developing a pilot or a few
pilot sites for consolidated in
room storage, something that
they would it would be for
spend, uh, commercial fuel and
they would take custody of that
fuel. Um and potentially, of
course, have contract managers
for those facilities, so
The decision gives the federal
government the ability to start
working with communities who are
interested in consolidated
interim storage sites across the
nation.
So the advisory committee is
reviewing that, um, keeping a
close eye on it. And as we have
updates, we'll provide that.
Sorry. We'll provide that to
this committee.
Within the the, UM
Program. We have a working group
where we have, um, employees
that
Are broken out through four
funded agencies. We work under a
FIVEYEAR Cooper agreement that
is provided by Congress, where
ending year two of the five year
agreement those four funded, um
Agencies is energy, minerals and
natural resources, the
Environment Department
Department of Health and that we
fund portions of Department of
public safety.
Um and I'll go into that.
In this last funding are award
was $1.2 million. What we do
with that funding, we provide
training and exercise along the
shipping corridor from Raton to
Carlsbad and through Hobbs.
Um, we provide exercises
training for hospitals, clinics,
law enforcement and the
community as a whole. Our last
exercise was with the city of
Santa Fe, and our next exercise
will be with the city of Raw and
Colfax County.
Um, We also developed a law
enforcement course for our local
communities. What we found in
our exercises was that our local
law enforcement wasn't as well
trained and hazardous materials
response and they were making
the scenes larger than what they
needed to be. So we focused on a
course just on maintaining that
hazardous material site that has
mat site until the hazmat teams
arrive or the firefighters show
up.
And then we continue training.
Um and maintaining
certifications for our law
enforcement and transportation
inspectors.
On one of your slides. It shows,
um the amount of shipments that
we have you. You should have a
loose page that was updated as
of yesterday in total shipments
received in New Mexico and and I
keep track of this because it's
how many inspections in New
Mexico conducts every shipment
that comes into New Mexico to
the website is inspected. As of
yesterday. We have 423 for
The, UM fiscal year, July 1 to
date yesterday. So those are our
state police officers and
transportation inspectors who
are conducting those inspections
at the ports of entry. Every
shipment comes to the website.
New Mexico sees every shipment
to whip
So we're impacted by the entire
program.
Um
This page breaks down.
From the sites itself. Again.
That number is updated, but we
receive shipments from Argon
National Laboratory. Idaho
National Labs, Los Alamos,
Lawrence Livermore, Oakridge and
Savannah Savannah River site.
In all, we have 171 emergency
response officers that we train
through New Mexico State police.
We provide funding for that
program. They receive an annual
refresher hazmat training and
they receive a general hazmat
course for our new emergency
response officers.
Uh, today we've had five courses
and we'll we should have one
last. Uh, General Hazmat course
coming up now in July at the
State Fire Academy and Soko
In total again 423 actual
inspections and what deal E
allows us to do as well so that
our inspectors maintain their
competencies. We also count
level six inspections for cobalt
shipments that come across our
highways. So I 40 I 10 those
shipments we count as hazardous
materials inspections on our
books for New Mexico State
police and again that's just to
maintain competencies.
And then we have 39 certified.
Level six inspectors and the
level six is the national
standard through commercial
Vehicle Safety Alliance.
And lastly, we have our training
with Department of Health. We
have 411 students trained to
date and 565 training hours.
That training is put on through
our trainer through Department
of Health. He, um, and the team
of trainers that we have They
teach doctors, nurses.
Housekeepers, uh, maintenance
staff how to put on and take off
personal protective equipment
safely and then also how to go
through decontamination process.
So we through Department of
Energy Fund Contam
decontamination showers and
equipment to those hospitals and
we go through annual training
quarterly training with them to
ensure that they're maintaining
their competencies in hospitals
and clinics as well along the
shipping corridor.
And that is my presentation. Any
questions?
Thank you, Madam Chair. Let the
good to see you. Good to see
you. Senators of great work.
Thanks for doing all that.
Um, do you have some questions?
Um,
On the whole tech.
They are. The license is more
than set. Asi or, uh, stopped.
It was vacated.
So that license is no more.
Um, last
The US Supreme Court says that
the Circuit court ruled an
error It is actually been
vacated.
But I think
You're right. Legal people seem
to think that it is headed
towards a a fight in the US
Supreme Court.
So stay tuned. That'll be really
interesting. Um
Number two. You had mentioned a
pilot site in you know for those
that don't know the federal
government kind of parallel to
our battles here in New Mexico.
Started doing something which I
think
Is a more appropriate route,
which is what they call consent
based, citing where they're
actually looking for communities
who want this, and we use the
word community. Lo loosely.
Because here in New Mexico, we
might have a community wanted
it, but the greater state didn't
want it and communities nearby
might not have wanted it, but so
I don't know how consensus
defined but nonetheless consent.
Um, design process and you had
mentioned that they're picking a
pilot site where they have
picked a pilot site. I didn't
quite understand what you meant
And or have they picked a pilot
side in New Mexico. God forbid,
So can you share what you meant
by that they picked a pilot site
and moving forward.
Madam Chair, Senator Steinborn
So the critical decision zero.
What it does is, it allows the
team to begin to work on
research and development,
conceptual design management
plans and cost and schedule
estimates.
And they in order for them to
begin construction anywhere they
have to have congressional
approval. There's also a change
to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act
that would need to take place.
So there's a lot of things that
have to happen before, but that
critical decision zero is
important because it gives them
the ability to start the process
for design and development. They
haven't picked a site yet, and
the interesting point when you
mentioned consent is that the
federal government still has not
defined what consent implies
Consent means a lot of different
things to different people to
different entities. Local
governments, tribes so
Until they
Confirm the actual definition of
consent and have a general
consensus on it.
It's still in the air.
Yeah.
Yeah, There's there's more
impact that parties than just
where it ends up and so
Um, a lot of people.
It impacts a lot of folks. So,
um
When you said it had it would ma
chair sorry that they would have
to amend the Nuclear Waste
Policy Act is that built into
their
Accepted terms of engagement
that they say we would have to
change the Nuclear Waste Policy
Act in order for a site to move
forward that the law itself is
that Congress would have to
actually codify that in law and
allow that through the Nuclear
Waste Policy Act.
Madam Chair, Senator Steinborn.
Yes, they do They recognize that
there are changes to the Nuclear
waste Policy Act that have to
take place. Um, one of the key
elements for this process is and
it's it's something to be noted,
is that Congress has already
released some of the funds from
the Nuclear waste Fund to
Department of Energy to start
this process, so I think it
total it's over $20 million that
Congress has released to
department of Energy, some
things that need to take place
is an understanding of how, um,
who takes custody of that waste.
Because it's commercial waste at
some point if it's a if it's a
federally funded project, the
federal site at some point, the
federal government would need to
take ownership of that waste.
What are the processes in that?
What are the legalities and the,
um
There's there's concerns with
The insurance.
On that waist, not just because
it's still
Commercial waste. How do we
transfer that to the federal
government? So there's a lot of
things that have to happen long
before there's a site, so we
know that we took about 30 years
they've been working on the
spent nuclear fuel project for
40 years, so it's It's not
something that's gonna happen in
the next 2 to 5 years.
Thank you. Um and, um you know,
no matter what they decide, I
would
Assume that our law Senate Bill
53, which makes it illegal to
store it here until there is a
permanent repository would
supersede
Any
Pilot phase I. I mean,
I mean, I guess the federal
government through law can try
to force something on a
certainly, but, um
Any rain, But of course, we all
know that we have that
prohibition in place,
regardless, But anyway, um I
just wanna say it's so good to
hear you talk about the
radioactive consultation task
force and the proactive work
you're doing, because that's
what we That's what we were
fighting for all these last few
years. That was a key part of
that bill was to strengthen that
and have us be proactive.
And look at private. Not just
say, Well, this showed up at our
door and we had no mandate to do
our due diligence. Actually, we
do have to do due diligence and
That's exactly what you're now
doing it.
Really great to hear. Uh, Madam
Chair. It did make me notice,
though, that, um I don't see it
on our work plan.
And this law has a requirement
and Ali that you did just kind
of do it. I mean, so you can say
that. It just happened this
year, but it might be good to go
a little more in depth. But the
law says that they have to
report to our committee
annually.
So
Um, the radioactive consultation
Task force.
So it almost should be a
permanent fixture in the work
plan every year because of that
requirement.
And, uh, Letha did just kind of
touch on it, and I don't know.
What your thoughts are. Those
thoughts are but might be good
to go. Madam Chair, Senator, I'm
glad to
Come and update you annually or
more.
As often as necessary.
Thank you. Um, on that point, I
just wanted to add, Um, we could
either do that in Santa Fe at
the end of this, so they have
more time to get some things to
present. Would that be good?
Madam Chair? Yes. OK, thank you.
Cool. Cool. And then I have one
final thing, Madam chair.
Um
And the lethal that that last
date is November 15th.
By the way.
We'll be back here. I think
that's the she's talking about
November 15th.
Uh, but but you'll work with
them.
Staff here and they'll figure it
out. But, um, the uranium
remediation coordinators kind of
a similar deal there. Also
supposed to report to us
annually. I didn't see that on
the work plan. I saw uranium
enrichment, but we have
coordinators cleanup
coordinators of abandoned sites
and N MD.
And the Environment Department
who were supposed to also come
here annually and we should my
request would be we put them on
in Gallup.
Get an update on what we're
doing. Thanks. That's all I have
good work.
That
Representative Chandler.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you for the presentation. Could
you talk to me a little bit
about what the consent order
says about prioritizing waste
from New Mexico sites.
Madam Chair, representative
Chandler.
I don't. I can't speak on that
because it's an environment
department.
Uh huh. Process So we deal with
the The lake that I deal with is
the transportation piece of
radioactive materials. The
Environment department has so
jurisdictional authority on the
permit and licensing.
Um
One of the things that we are
working on with Department of
Energy is defining what legacy
waste is because it speaks of
legacy waste within the permit
itself.
So
Department of Energy calls that
field office and stakeholders so
the Western Interstate Energy
Board and National Governors
Association are collaborating
along with other stakeholders in
the DOE to identify with that
legacy. Waste definition is and
in addition to that the permit
So the issue with Los Alamos is
When
Years ago, when we had the 37 06
program under Governor Martinez,
it was a um, agreement to remove
as much waste off the hill that
we could from
With the with the OE.
So we moved all of the low
hanging fruit. So essentially
anything that was easily
packaged, low level lower
levels. We were able to take off
the hill, the the issue now with
Los Alamos is that we're getting
it to much more complicated
waste, and it takes more time.
It takes about
A year to two years to go
through the characterization and
certification process of waste.
So if there for example, if
there's a barrel, they've got to
take that barrel of waste. Break
it down or a glove box. Break it
down. Takes about 1 to 2 years
to identify with the waste is to
characterize it and break it
down enough so that it can meet
the waste acceptance criteria to
be shipped to whip. That's why
we have average about two
shipments out of Los Alamos a
week.
Where before when we had a lot
of waste.
Easy ways to move. We were
moving 15 to 20 shipments a
week, So the priority is Los
Alamos is always a priority for
DOE. It's a priority for us to
get waste off the hill. The
issue is it's not road ready
waste so as long as it takes to
characterize and certify it and
make it acceptable for whip
It's a little bit more
challenging than than previous
ways that we moved.
Yeah, and and just for, um
members of the public cause I
there is a I don't think we went
over this. There's an
informational sheet.
That shows since, UM July 1
2023. The amount of waste moved
from either Los Alamos or LA or,
um Livermore. Uh, not Livermore.
Um
Sand was, uh, 36.
Barrel was 36 shipments
shipments, Whereas, um, Here we
go again. Idaho is a much loved
state, apparently by DOE 336
shipments.
Um, and before
It's pointed out that, um we can
only ship what's ready because
I'm sure that's what people are
thinking. Um
What's ready can be accelerated.
if a more resources are put on
the problem.
And my concern and this is not
directed at you, Madam Chair or
our speaker is that the choice
has been not to do that that
this number of shipments from
New Mexico sites has been pretty
constant. As far as I I've been
participating on this committee.
It has not changed very much,
notwithstanding the fact there
have been commitments made to
improve, and so I just wanna
make that point. And, yes, I
Where it's what's ready that can
be shipped. The question now is
DOE is responsible for getting
what is ready and putting the
net the resources on the problem
And apparently, that has not
happened yet. It's been
provided.
Madam Chair representative. I
think one of the issues and why
it's so difficult to move waste
from Lano. You have to entities
that are there you have a
department of Energy
environmental management, which
is responsible for the
transportation leg of it, and
they waste and then you have an
NSA and their waste and and then
say on EM to move their waste.
And so you have these two
different entities and two
different management, which in
our mind, we think should be
working collaboratively and they
don't
Please. Um
It's something that I think
The administrator, his attempted
to address. Um and we're hoping
now with the new manager at the
Lel site. We can get some
movement because you, um Madam
Chair when you say the new
manager, You mean the new EM
manager?
Oh, yes. OK, So, uh, Madam
Chair. Appreciate that, but they
actually are one entity. It's
called the Department of Energy.
So they I understand that split
was done. I don't know how some
number of years ago to improve
operations. So if that's not
working that again, Madam Chair
is on the Department of Energy
to make it work, and it's not
our job.
To find excuses for a structural
issue if that's what it is.
It's our job. I believe, madam
chair to demand that the
Department of Energy resolve the
structural issue if that's what
it is. And if funding is the
issue, Madam Chair, it's the
Department of energy
responsibility, whether it's
EM and NSA, and they're pointing
fingers at each other about
who's not doing it. It's the God
the person at the top who was
responsible for resolving that
so that the department works
efficiently and in the interests
of
New Mexico residents. Thank you,
madam Chair.
Are there any other questions
from the committee?
I have, uh, just a couple that
haven't been covered. I was
wondering, um, when your budget
is 1.28 million
Um
Is this? Uh, what you requested?
Is that enough for what needs to
be done?
Um, you know,
For, I guess does that include
the task force?
Uh, working group.
Madam chair, So the funding that
we receive is a five year
Co-operative agreement that is
appropriated by Congress.
The total five year award is 6.8
million. We break that 6.8
million up in a five year award.
So every year we submit a budget
to Department of Energy cars,
Bud Field Office based on our
project work plan, and what our
intent is and and that ties back
to the CNC agreement from 1981.
It's specifically for emergency
response training.
So we staff we pay for staffing
of our
Um, coordinators to go out and
conduct that training in the
local communities so that we
know we have
Emergency response capability to
respond to a Web transportation
event.
The the funding only covers whip
transportation. It does not
cover anything with spent
nuclear fuel. It is specific
just for
Whip transportation.
Under the CNC agreement, And my
question is that is that enough
or do we need to? I mean, are
you asking for more when when we
need to? Yes. So every year what
I do the way I break the budget
out every other year, I'm doing
an exercise in the community. So
some years my budgets are higher
than other years because what we
do when we conduct our exercises
we move into that community
where boots on the ground with
that jurisdiction working with
their firefighters. Department
of Energy brings trainers to
conduct
Specific training. We provide
training to the hospitals and
clinics. We ensure that our law
enforcement officers are trained
Are inspectors maintain their
certification. So we've moved
into that community. So on those
years, our budget is a little
bit higher. But what I manage is
that 6.8 million within that
five year period and then
depending on what Congress
appropriates in the next five
years.
So the convenience of the
Co-operative agreement versus an
actual grant is
I have the ability if I need to
request more funding from DOE, I
can get that obligation. I can
get that appropriation from DOE.
If I needed more money from
their budget.
They can move that into the whip
transportation program. Thank
you, and also, um
When you mentioned, um
Having the shipments go through
the ports of entry.
Um
Your training. Um
I guess Border patrol where who
are at those, Um
Madam chair. What we have are
state police inspectors and
civilian inspectors through
department of Public Safety.
They signed at the ports of
entry, so they're conducting
inspections on not just with
transportation but other
commercial vehicles that come
through the ports of entry that
are required to be inspected, so
they do a range of a level one
to a level six inspection. Our
arch Los received that hazardous
materials inspection is
different from
A WalMart truck. A WalMart truck
doesn't receive a level six
inspection.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Let always good to see you.
Thank you for your presentation.
Um
So whip celebrated its 25th
anniversary on March th this
pretty big milestone.
A lot of environmental cleanup.
You're you're correct. I think
you said Madam chair and Ali
that
It gets a little harder because
the low hanging fruits already
been dealt with.
Um, So if you were to
Uh, write a short article on the
whip transportation system
through the what would you say?
Madam Chair, representative
Brown. What I would say is that
the Web transportation program
has been the most successful
program. There's over 16 million
miles traveled no accidents,
Minimal accidents due to
weather. Um it has the most
robust.
Qualification requirements or
its drivers.
Um
The program itself is very
successful. The safer the safest
trucks on the highway for sure.
Um, they're governed at 65 Miles
an hour, and there's two drivers
with every vehicle. Um, their
con continually monitored. I
monitor every shipment that I
know is coming to New Mexico. I
receive a rolling schedule an
eight week rolling schedule that
tells me what shipments at what
date and time will be departing
and arriving. Um, I have a
satellite system that I
Log into provided by department
of energy that I can monitor
every truck.
In and through New Mexico.
Um
It is by far the safest
commercial vehicle on the
highway.
I would
Put our drivers against any and
I say our drivers because for
me, it's we're all a team. I
take ownership of my entire
team. Even though it's not my
federal program. I just over
oversee the state leg of it.
But for me, our drivers through
the whip program are the most
qualified the safest and the
trucks are by far the safest.
Much safer than a walmart or a
FedEx truck or some of the
other.
Hazardous material vehicles that
are out there.
Um, from a transportation
perspective.
The work that we do in the
communities.
I would put up against any other
Um
Entity. We have a very robust
program. Our trainers are
exceptional. They've been with
the program for years. We have
one individual who's been with
the program over 30 years.
Another over 20 years, um, very
qualified individuals working
the program on the
transportation leg of it.
Well, thank you and I. I agree
with everything you just said,
Um, and it's a very impressive
program.
So congratulations to you on the
25th anniversary and, uh, best
wishes moving forward. Thank
you, madam Chair.
Thank you.
Representative Sarinana. Thank
you, Madam Chair. Thank you for
your presentation. So when you
were talking about ports of
entry are all the shipper sites
in the United States.
Madam Chair, representative
Sara, the we have
A variety of sites. So Lord's
Livermore is in California,
Argos in Chicago, Oak Ridge in
Tennessee, Savannah, Riverside
in South Carolina, Um Idaho.
So most of our shipments come
through.
Raton, which is the port of
entry for Lawrence Livermore,
INL. Argon. Um, we are Savannah
River shipments come through
Eunice, So I didn't understand
that part. OK? Thank you, That's
all. Thanks. Thank you so much.
we appreciate. Um you
presenting, uh, again to our
committee, and, um
As a representative, Brown said,
You know, good job. 25th
Anniversary. Thank you, Madam
Chair Committee.
OK, thank you. Um and, um
Senator. I mean, representative
Alcon left, But, um, Senator
Pinto. Thank you, madam Chair.
members of the committee and
we're on webcast those out there
as I'm Senator Shannon Pinto
from District three McKinney in
San Juan. Thank you, madam
Chair.
There's representative Alco.
Representative outcome. We were
just introducing
If you would introduce yourself,
please.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I am, uh
Representative Elise Alcon. I
represent District six, which is
part of, uh
Sebola and McKinley County.
I, uh, my fame? Uh
In this committee is that I am a
previous uranium miner worked
underground, uh, with Ker McGee
for seven years and, uh, made
some good money.
And now we're trying to clean up
the mess that we made out there.
Hopefully, we'll get it done.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, representative and
also trying to get, uh, uranium
mine workers who might not have
been included into the, uh, Rica
act when we just have
I think a matter of days before
Congress needs to do that, So
thank you. I think that would be
awesome, Madam chair cause I
could use the money.
A lot of people, uh, could use
it for their health issues and
other things they've suffered.
So thank you. Um, Next, we have
an overview of the Office of
Natural Resources trustees role
in restoring resources affected
by the release of radioactive
and hazardous material, and, uh,
we have, um
Miss Kate Gerard. And, um our,
um
Trustee Maggie Hart. Stebbins.
Good morning.
It is still morning, right? Yes.
Well, we're
Yes, please.
Good morning, madam Chair.
Members of the committee. Um I
want to first thank you for
giving us the opportunity to be
here today. It is always, um, a
privilege for us to come and
talk with you about, um, what we
do at the office of the Natural
Resources Trustee. Um my name is
Maggie Hartstein. I was
appointed by Governor Rohan
Grisham to be trustee in 2019.
I'm joined by our executive
director Keith Gerard. And we're
also joined by, um, one of our
summer interns. SUNAINA McKee,
who is joining us today. So, um
Um
The office of the, uh, the New
Mexico Office of the Natural
Resources Trust. Oh, First of
all, Madam Chair I would just
like to ask, um
Many of the sides are are
introductory sides are ones that
we have presented to this
committee in the past, and, um I
would just love to have your
feedback. If some of these feel
repetitive. Um I'm happy to skip
over them. But just the general
overview. Um I'm happy to either
present that or not, depending
on your schedule. So, please,
I'll just look to you if you
just, You know, Want me to skip
over the slides. Please let me
know. All right. So to begin
the, um, the office of the
Natural resources trustee is a
small state agency.
There are five of us when we are
fully staffed. We are
administratively attached to the
New Mexico Environment
Department and the office of the
Attorney general provides our
legal counsel.
I a slide number two.
Our mission.
To do natural resource damage
assessment and restoration and
you'll see in our presentation
That acronym Nerd, Um, that
describes the process that we
follow in order to make sure
that New Mexico's natural
resources are, um brought back
to pre spil condition following
the release of a hazardous
substance or oil. Um
Our program seeks compensation
from responsible parties to
restore natural resources for
the benefit of our residents,
Um, at no cost to taxpayers. It
is our, um, mission to, um, have
polluters pay to restore these
resources, um, not taxpayers.
And when I talk about natural
resources we talk about we mean
groundwater, surface water
drinking water, Um land Fish,
wildlife, wildlife habitat. Um,
the entire
System of a, um particular um
Environment.
Slide number three we gain we
our authority comes to us under
the New Mexico Natural Resources
Trustee Act that was passed in
1993. And on this slide. I've
listed what the statute says Our
sibil are. Um and we, um pursue
claims under federal law, so
under Cercla, the Clean Water
Act and the Federal Oil
Pollution Act.
Um, the regulations under Cercla
were promulgated by the
Department of Interior. And so
that establishes a process that
we follow to bring, um natural
resources claims.
Slide number four, So I think
it's important to establish, um,
our relationship to the New
Mexico Environment Department.
So following the release of a
hazardous substance or oil, the
responsibility is shared, Um,
the environment department.
Is responsible for mediation,
which is, um to clean up. Um,
the the contamination to
minimize exposure and risk to
humans and the environment.
Our process, the NTA process we
require the responsible party to
restore the resource to PPI
conditions and if that's not
possible to replace the
resource. Um we also can see
compensation when, um, access to
the for the services, uh, for
loss of services of those
natural resources, so access to
water access to land wildlife.
Um, so that is where we can go
above and beyond what the
environment department can, um
Pursue.
Um, we can also ask for, um,
compensation for the for the
duration of the injury. So from
the time that a resource is
contaminated to the time it is
cleaned up and restored, um to
for public use, um we asked the
responsible party to compensate
communities for that.
Slide number five. I won't, um
like, walk through this in
detail. But as I said the
department of the Interior
promulgated the regulations for,
um, the nerd process. Um, we
follow this process. Um
And, um the advantages of any of
our claims. Go to litigation
Following this process does does
give us um rebuttable
presumption.
Should we go to court? Um
Three sort of key parts of this
assessment. That is where we, um
We generally use either EPA data
or Environment Department data
to evaluate the injury.
Um, both the the intensity of
the injury and the qua and the
quantity of the injury that has
been of the resource that's been
entered. Um we next, then
determine what will it take to
restore the resource? What are
the strategies that are
available for restoring a
resource and what will they
cost? Um, once we have that,
that's that's a way to monetize
the injury. Um
We then enter into negotiations
when possible with the polluters
with the responsible party. Um,
again, and that's part of our
effort. Our our mission to have
polluters pay for the
restoration, not taxpayers. Um,
when it when, um, we are able to
reach a settlement as
Most murder cases.
Are ultimately settled, as
opposed to litigated. Um we
then, um have whatever the
amount of money is that has been
provided. We work with affected
communities to come up with the
restoration, Um, projects that
they prioritize.
Um
Um, slide number six.
Since 2000, the office of the
Natural Resources trustee has
recovered over $43 Million.14
settlements over these past
years. Um, and just in the last
since 2020 we have, um
We have, um, reached for more
than $14 million in settlements.
The more recent ones are listed
at the top of this slide. Um
And some of these, um
Settlements. We still have funds
remaining. We, um it is always
my intention to get the dollars
out of the trustee fund and
working for communities as
quickly as possible. Um,
sometimes that there are delays.
Um
Of your kind that, um
That prevent us from doing that,
but we still have funding left
over from the questa settlement.
The Freeport McMorran settlement
the South Valley settlement,
Gold King Mine and Fort Wingate,
so the dollars from those
settlements are still in the
trustee fund, although we are
trying to get them spent, um
Slide number seven. A recent
settlement that we reached with
the Department of Defense over
natural resource injuries at
Fort Wingate. Um our co
trustees, um are the Navajo
Nation and the Zuni tribe in
2022. We reached an agreement
with a settlement agreement with
the Department of Defense. The
US Army for, um, $1.4 million
and we've spent the last most of
the last two years working with
our co trustees to identify
projects that that the Zuni
Tribe in the Navajo nation.
Prioritize. So, um, in February,
we, um
We came to an agreement. We
published the final restoration
plan that, um identified Forest
forest restoration and fuel,
wood production and blue Head
sucker habitat conservation
again. Those were projects that
were prioritized by the two
tribes. Um, the court has
approved the release of the
funds that will go actually
directly to the tribes. Um, we
are still waiting for the
dollars to actually.
Um
Be released, but those projects
the restoration projects can
then begin. Um
Slide number eight of the $52
million that came to the, uh,
State of new Mexico. Uh, through
the different gold King mine
Litigation settlements. 13
million came to the office of
the Natural Resources Trustee,
And these are the projects the
14 projects that have been
selected through our open and
transparent and community
focused, Um
Selection process. Um, and this
is a good example of where ON
RT so the Environment department
was responsible for making sure
that there was no residual
contamination from the Gold King
mine release, But what we were
able to do was actually ask for
compensation or use the dollars.
We got to compensate for the
loss of services. So the Gold
King mine release the the
entities that were most
impacted. Really Were the were
farmers, the outdoor recreation
industry and local governments
who were not able to use the
So among these projects, you'll
see that there are three
projects that benefit outdoor
recreation, six that are focused
on local farming, um, to focused
on groundwater protection three
on aquatic habitat and one
drinking water project with the
city of Aztec.
They have asked for funding and
we've approved funding to, um re
re rehabilitate their one of
their water reservoirs.
And we are very excited to be
working with all of these
project proponents, um but
particularly San Juan County.
They are doing an amazing job of
getting these projects underway.
Um, the first one is already
complete. The um Cedar Hill boat
ramp. Um, that benefits the
outdoor recreation industry,
and, um, they have just told us
that they're ready to break
ground on the, um
Waste water and wastewater
improvements for the Tota
subdivision so very excited
about that.
Again. Our intention is to get
these dollars out as quickly as
possible. But that all depends
on the local governments that
are doing the implementation.
Um, slide number nine. You know,
the the community, Um
You know, the San Juan County
community has recognized the
importance of these dollars in
um, of the restoration dollars
in terms of, um, economic
impact, and the Daily Times has
written several stories about
Like to what it means to have
these dollars coming in, as they
are working to replace the jobs
that have been lost through. Um,
the closure of the coal mine in
the coal fired power plant.
Um
Slide number 10 We have found,
um, our
One of our, um, criteria for
selecting projects or the
potential for leveraging ON RT
dollars. And, um, here are two
examples where that has
happened. Um, the Albuquerque,
BERLI. County Water Utility
Authority. We have committed, um
Uh, $556,000. They have
leveraged that into an
additional 8.4 million to build
out the project that's been
identified. Um, the Farmington
Gateway Project.
We have committed $300,000. They
have leveraged that for another
$2 million in funds, so this is
the type of impact that we hope.
Um, these dollars will
Um, generate
Um, so I talked about the nerd
process. So those are
settlements that I have just
talked about. Um, this slide
lists that, um current and
potential, um, damage
assessment. Natural resource
damage assessments that are
underway. Um, we have the long
standing, um
Natural resource damage
assessment underway at Los
Alamos National Labs at the
Whites Ancestor facility, Rio
ALM.
Um
Uranium mill and mine sites. And
then um
Three.
New cases that we are
developing, Um
The
To hopefully, um initiate a full
blown, uh, damage assessment. Um
Can an Air Force base Haman and,
um, the grants mining district.
And so I'll start with. Um And
so these next slides talk about
those specific, um, damage
assessments that we are either
planning or have underway. Um,
as you probably know, um
The EPA recently, um
Designated PFS.
Um and peoples as hazardous
substances under Cercla, Um,
what under we can only pursue
natural resource damage cases
when a contaminant has been
listed as a hazardous substance.
And so this is what we've been
waiting for. We have been aware
of PFOs contaminations around
the state. We have been doing
the preliminary work to the
degree we could to prepare for,
Um, this point in time. Um
The FIFA sites that we are
currently you know, looking at
or can an Air force base
Holloman and Los Alamos?
So the next slide, um, number
13. This is just a graph that
came from the US Geological
Services. 2024 Assessment report
of PFOs, Um, releases around the
state. Um
In in collaboration with the
Environment Department. They
sampled service and groundwater
around the state and PFOs was
detected in all major rivers and
in 27 of 100 and 17 groundwater
wells, So it's fairly pervasive.
Um
Two of the PFAs assessments that
we have, um undertaken or Canon
Air Force Base and home Air
Force Base. Um, this slide. I'm
sorry. Slide number 14 lists all
of the, um
Substances that have been
detected at all The PF
substances have been detected at
Canon, Um
And I. I know that you are well
aware of the, um
Impacts of the groundwater
contamination at Cannon, Um
So we have our assessment
underway there. Um, slide number
15. So, um, earlier this year,
you may have read the reports of
the study that was released by
the University of New Mexico's
Museum of Southwester Biology.
Um, they looked at PFOs levels
of PFOs contamination in wild
birds and mammals at Homan Lake.
Um, that was a location to which
the Air Force Base discharged
Wastewater. And, um, the water
itself has
Extraordinarily high levels of
PFAs contamination,
But what was striking about this
is that the, um
Um Wildlife also had
astronomically high levels of PF
in their in their tissues. Um
And I'm just gonna quote from
the press release the University
of Mexico's press release across
the 23 species of birds and
mammals, PFOs concentrations
averaged in the tens of
thousands of parts per billion
to put this in perspective, the
research team pointed out that
the thousands of dairy cattle in
Clovis that recently had to be
be destroyed because their milk
was contaminated less than six
parts per billion.
So the the levels of tissue, uh
of PFOs contamination in the in
the tissues of these wildlife?
Um
That were sampled are among the
highest in the world.
Um and Homan Lake is an
important breeding ground for
migratory birds. I think the
study said that it's one of the
largest and most ecologically
significant water sources in the
Tularosa Basin.
So the next slide because
wildlife um is a natural
resource that we are empowered
to pursue claims for, um, I
won't walk through this whole
slide, but clearly these PFOs,
um contaminate these P fss
levels in these, um animals, um,
qualify as a natural resource
injury.
So, um, uh, we can pursue, um,
compensation for, for example,
There is a a an advisory that,
um people should not eat. Um,
uh, waterfowl that have been,
um, that have been exposed to
Haman Lake. Um, that is a loss,
Um, for New Mexico hunters, for
example, Um, there are we can
also pursue a claim for reduced
reproduction for higher
mortality of of of these
particular creatures. So, um
That sort of laid out on slide
number 16 and slide number 17 If
you just look at that graph. I'm
sorry. It's kind of small, but
that red line is the P faucet
liver tissue threshold that, um,
after which, um, reduced
reproduction takes place, So
that is what's considered to be
a tolerable level of phos
contamination. And you can see
for many of these, um
Birds. These were bird liver
tissue. Um, samples.
The Exceedance is are
Extraordinary.
Um um so
That's our Holloman. Uh, injury
assessment. I think our next
step will probably be to reach
out to Holleman to see if they
are interested in, uh,
partnering with us on doing, um,
the injury assessment. The
damage assessment. Um so that's
the next step there. Um, the
next slip is slide has to do
with, uh, Los Alamos. National
Labs. Um, among the many
releases of hazardous substances
There have been detections of
PFOs. Um, we are in the early
stages of, um, assessing the
PFS.
Is there but that will be added
to the, uh, damage assessment
that is already underway.
Um, the next. Um so that's PFS.
Um
One of the, um
We currently have
a A
Co-operative damage assessment.
That means we are working with
the Rio Algom, Um, mine owners
to look at the to analyze the
natural resource injury at the
Rio Algom. Um, give me mine site
and
But we recognize there are many
other natural resource injuries
that likely have occurred at
other, um, uranium mine and mill
sites in the grants mining
district and so we are rather
than do these, Um, look at each
of the sites. Um, in a, um,
individually we are putting
together um, kind of our master
plan for how we will, um, look
at pursuing claims for natural
resource injuries. Um,
throughout, um, the Ambrosia
Lake and the UM San Mateo Creek.
And then, of course, our
favorite. Um, natural resource.
Um, case is the White Sands test
facility outside of Las Cruces.
Um, you know, this slide again
tells you like who are co
trustees are? What are the
injuries? Um, you know, NASA has
been testing, um, rockets at the
White Sands test facility now
for, um, since 1960. So for many
decades, there have been
releases of hazardous substances
into the groundwater. Um, and a
very conservative estimate of
the plume. The volume
Contaminated water is at least
30,000 acre feet. So, um
We have, um
Completed our injury assessment.
Um and, um
I think, as you know, reached
out to NASA to invite them to
enter into settlement, Uh,
settlement discussions, um, to
resolve this natural resource
injury liability, Um and I'll
just go to slide number 21
again. That gives you a sense of
where White Sands test facility
is relative to, um, the city of
Las Cruces.
So this plume is four miles
long, Two miles wide. Um,
And in very close proximity to
the city of Las Cruces, drinking
water wells.
Um
Slide number 22. What are the
next steps? I think as you, uh,
First of all, we wanna, um thank
you for the letter that this
committee sent to NASA
leadership. Um, following that,
we did see for a short period of
time. Some movement in, um,
movement towards settlement
conversations. Um,
unfortunately, that
Spirit of collaboration did not
last, and we feel like we're
sort of back where we were, Um,
six months ago. Um
The Department of Justice has
identified what they consider to
be an obstacle to, um any
settlement, and NASA and the
department of the New Mexico
Environment Department are in
discussions to try and resolve
that issue. Um, but DOJ has
indicated to us that they will
not consider any settlement
until that issue is resolved,
and that that
Issue is whether or not white
Sands test facility is on the
path to establishing a final
remedy for the groundwater
contamination.
So, um
We do not believe that
Um resolving that issue is
essential to reaching a
settlement with NASA and the
department of Defense. Um
The issue that they are raising
would be an issue should this
case go to litigation, but as in
most murder cases, they are
concluded through settlements
and settlement in this
particular case would be a huge
advantage to new Mexicans to get
this done quickly. Uh, while
they are still options for
replacing the contaminated
groundwater, Um and it's
Demonstrably better for a United
States taxpayers because the
longer this injury is a, um
Exists and unaddressed. Um, the
costs.
Increase. So, um
We continue to hope that we
will, um
See some movement.
On this, But, um again, we want
to thank you for your, um, your
efforts to move it along. Um so
that concludes my presentation.
Uh, again, Kate and I are here
to answer any questions. Um, and
again Thank you for giving us
this opportunity.
Yeah.
Thank you, Madam Chair and good
to be with you, Um, M, trustee
and good to be with you, Uh,
question. Quick question. So
Thank you for the work. You're
doing number one. It's just
shocking This data coming out of
Holleman.
And the contamination PFAs
contamination of our wildlife
there. It's unbelievable.
Um, but of course we're seeing
it every every place. It's
really kind of a crisis right
that we need to stop injuring
Having these injuries to our
natural resources and to
threatening public
Public water supplies and other
stuff are land. But, um
I guess. One question is given
the Environment department's
legal efforts with DOD.
On these basis, you know, trying
to get settlements or whatever.
How does those? How do those
efforts dovetail your your men?
You're flagging these bases
you're working on getting
Recovery for the injury damage
They're working on litigate. How
do these areas? How do these
issues Deputy
Well, um
Mr Vice Chairman. Members of the
committee. Um
Until, um, last month. We could
not bring a claim for PFAs
contamination because it had not
yet been designated as a
hazardous substance by the EPA.
Um, we do. We are represented by
the New Mexico Attorney
General's office. Um, they have
been they in the Environment
department have brought
Claims for, um
Um, for remediation. They've got
a number of, um
Requests that are part of their
their litigation. I believe we
will now, um
Be able to bring a claim we of
obviously coordinate with, um,
the other parties. But our claim
will be different. It will be
for natural resource
restoration. And I think in the
case of Clovis that will be
likely looking for alternative
sources of water. I think you
have heard many times that, uh,
the farmers the local
governments cannot use that
water. It is not going to be
available for for decades and so
part of nerd is that we can
seek, um we can ask the
responsible party and that would
likely be the air.
Um, to find alternates to pay
for alternate sources of water.
So we we are in
Conversations with the attorney
general's office about how we
will coordinate on these cases.
That. Let me let me ask you this
ma'am chair. Um and trustee is
Are. We 100% certain, though,
that our legal efforts are
Harmonized and not in conflict
in any way that you know you
have different people to
negotiating table that one
person isn't and
unintentionally undermining the
other person's
Work in terms of what we're
asking for.
Is there co ordination
Absolutely. And we at RT are
very cognizant of the
responsibilities of these of
our, um fellow New Mexico
agencies and departments. And so
we, um, are absolutely committed
to doing this in collaboration
and alignment so that all
interests are
Respected We do are having
regular conversations about
that.
And it was so outrageous Thank
you so much for doing this work
now. We also learned that a
committee meeting Madam chair.
On produce water that the
produce water consortium, she
said. It just kind of matter of
factly, just explaining her
methodology. It was kind of the
news in and of itself. She said
that there was PF and the Pecos
River and
So that's a different area.
But there's fish in that river
People grow crops in that area.
And so are we doing any work in
that region to look and then
this committee took action,
saying that we did not
He used in oil and gas
operations.
And which they said
We don't use any like they had
done some anecdotal research.
but somehow PFAs has showed up.
In the Pecos River. So I guess
my question is. Are you all
doing any work in that area?
Not yet.
But that is on our work plan.
Good I. I just wanted to make
sure it was on your radar and
the produced water consortium
was the one who who has the
receipt.
Allegedly so
Sensitive mind. Thank you, man.
That's all I have for now.
Next. We have representative
Brown.
Thank you, madam Chair.
And Madam Trustee. Uh, good to
see you again.
Um, I'm looking at and I don't
know the page number because I'm
not sure where the page number
show up. But it's the, um
Uh, NRDAR slide. It shows a the
steps that you follow. Uh so,
uh, the question you maybe don't
need to even look at it. But
madam chair and trustee
Um the ultimate goal is to looks
like compensate the public for
losses. Would that be correct?
Yes to restore the resource and
compensate communities when they
have separate a loss because of
that, because of that
contamination, OK, So, um Madam
Chair and and Madam trusty.
Maybe I'm being a little too
literal here. But if it's for
public losses, how do you define
public as distinct from private
and especially if the land is
adjacent, Uh, public and
private.
You draw the line there and say
we're not going to help the
private landowner even though
that problem is
Aerial down chair.
Um, Madam Chair Representative
Brown. So there if the Gold King
mine projects that were
selected, I think are a good
example of how we look at that
issue, so the anti donation
clause prohibits us from giving
money directly to any
individual, But what we have
chosen our projects that will
benefit that are accessible to
any member of the public. And,
um, we provide AAA benefit to
the community as a whole. So,
for example, the project we're
doing with the soil and
Conservation District. Those
are, um giving training and
resources and materials actually
to farmers who want to, Um um
Restore their soil Health and so
that is a anyone is is eligible
to participate, and, um, that's
considered a broader public
benefit. So it qualifies, so
it's not an anti donation
violation. But, um, you know, we
look the the boat ramp
accessible to anybody that, um,
you know, we consider that to be
pro, providing a a public
benefit, but certainly these
projects that individuals can
use to, um
To restore their farmlands, or,
you know, whatever. Um
They're eligible.
OK, I don't did that. Answer
your question. Yes, ma'am. It
does. Thank you, Madam Chair and
then Madam Trustee.
Um, Is there anything in writing
about this policy? I mean, I. I
like the idea that it's helping
landowners who are adjacent to
the problem, or at least
experiencing it themselves. So
what do you have in writing or
in statute and rule? Um, that
would
Give us this comfort.
About the coverage, ma'am chair,
So we do have a, um
A process that we follow and I'd
be happy to send you the
documents that, um, we use for
the gold King Mine, Um, project
solicitation, and so we reached
out to the community, um, in
every way possible. The four
Corners area, anyone who might
have been affected by the Gold
King mine release and then we
are very clear. These are the
These are the criteria by which
projects will be screened. These
are the criteria by which
they'll be ranked. Um and we
publicize that process ahead of
time.
I, um
Received proposals and we we put
in a again in a very transparent
way. Scored them according to
these criteria, and, um
The the 14 projects that were
ultimately selected all ranked
very high. Um, according to
those criteria, so I'm happy to,
um, share those with you. And,
um, if if that would help,
there's nothing actually in in
statute that requires us to do
that, Um, I observe that other
states who recovered funds for
Gold King Mine, um they
trustees.
Their trustees did not make that
kind of effort to get community
input, so there's nothing that
obligates us to do that. But
that was the process that I
inherited when I came to this
position, and I think it's a
good one. And we follow it. OK.
very good. Thank you. And I
think I have one other question.
Uh, Madam chair and I think this
is page 12.
It's PFAs cases.
Um, it mentions that in April of
this year, EPA finalized a rule
regarding designating. Uh,
these, um as hazardous
substances under cercla. And
then on the next page, I think
it's page 13. We have a box at
the bottom of the graphic that
says that facilities that may
use PFS.
And then they're listed there
and I'm just curious if
This still applies in light of
what happened last month with
the designation are are are
these and and this was EPA 2022
mentions airport cement
manufacturing, electronics
industry and so forth. So has
that changed in light of what
happened last month.
Madam chair.
Um, Madam Chair, representative
Brown I. I can't answer that. I
would. I do believe that these,
uh, data are probably outdated
by now because the EPA has also
set new standards for PFOs in
drinking water, for example, um
And I believe the day that was
that's presented in the sport
was from 2001 2002 Sorry, 2021
2022, so I would guess it.
If this were produced. If the
data were collected today, it
would be different, but
I can't answer that question.
OK, definitively, So I
apologize. OK, I know it's it's
all moving at this point. So
anyway, Thank you, Madam Chair.
That's all I had. Um, just on
one of your, um, Did you want to
answer
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you for your question
Representing your questions. Uh,
I wanted to add in terms of our
spending of money and one of the
reasons why I wanted this job
was because it gave me the
ability to work with the trustee
who has a higher fiduciary duty
and and and that duty for the
per our statute is to use all
recovered funds for the purpose
and only for the purpose of
restoring the the resources or
acquiring the equivalent thereof
of the resources that were
actually
Damaged so the money that is in
in the trust fund that the
trustee oversees is is truly
limited to that.
But not only by federal law but
by the state statute. So just
add that that's all. Thank you.
Thank you, Um representative
Sarinana.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you for the presentation as
always Great. Um, so we were
talking about Holloman Lake,
Who's responsibility is it to
educate the public We find out
in committee, But what about the
people? I mean, I'm gorge is not
that far away right from this
area. Do you know who's
responsibility is to
Educate the public.
Um, Madam Chair, Representative
Siana. I can't definitively
answer that question. But I
believe that the Department of
Health and the Environment
Department have that role. Our
focus is really on the natural
resources. Um
They have more responsibility
for the human health impacts.
OK, thank you. That's all OK,
anyone else committee questions?
OK, I, um have lots, um, not off
the hook yet, but, um, to follow
up on, um
The Holloman Lake. Um
You mentioned about? You know,
the
My well, My question is about
the migration pattern.
How you know these animals. Uh,
the ducks, the birds will fly to
other areas that are unaware
that these could be
contaminated, Um, animals that
they might hunt. How do we
Let people know about that. Or,
you know, put a warning on each
one
a little tag.
So, um, how it to follow up with
what? Uh, represents was talking
about
Um, Madam chair following the
release of this report, there
were several stories in the
local media Environment
department did make some
statements about you know, the
The advisory that humans should
not be consuming these these
waterfowl, But as you have
pointed out there, they're
migratory birds. They are
traveling, you know?
From Canada to
Mexico and maybe further and so,
um, that is a, uh, an enormous
challenge to number one.
Um, test birds in various
locations and, um
Worn hunters about consumption.
Um, I'm not sure I have an
answer to that. It's surely, um
Needed.
So, uh,
Yeah, That's a really big
problem. Um, also, um, when you
were talking about, you know,
uh, San Juan County being so
successful of implementing $13
million worth of, um,
restorative measures. Um, do you
have staff that helps guide them
on the different opportunities
that they have, Um and how to
implement and monitor those
programs. Um, do you get enough
funding to have enough staff?
To, you know, because that's
just one area if we start
getting settlements to all the
other, um
Uh, restorative needs would you
be able to handle? Um Madam
chair? Thank you for that
question, So each of these
projects come to us as a fully,
um fleshed out proposal. So San
Juan County, for example, gave
us to three proposals. Two
proposals, um, in which they
agreed they did the the
planning. They did that. The
engineering, um they are doing
the construction or contracting
for the construction. And we do
have, um, staff that oversee
that, um, again. Thank you to
the
Legislature In recent years. You
have provided us with an
additional FTE. So we have two
people who, um, oversee
Um, project implementation.
They help, you know?
They help with the, um,
development of the restoration
plan in which we select the
projects and then do all of the
contracting work that is
required in all of the
oversight.
Um
Of those projects. Um
I do.
You that?
There is so much so many
opportunities in the state that
we at ORD cannot yet, um,
address because of staff
capacity. There are five of us
and, um
And I, and I think when we get
to a point where I feel like our
staff is not sufficient, we
certainly add that perhaps to
our next to a you know our
budget some year I feel right
now. We are, uh, we have
sufficient staff. We're doing
fine. We have an amazing staff.
Um
Hard working, but, um
At some point, I think if we
were actually pursue all the
claims that that we should, um
we would eventually
Wanna grow.
OK, great. So we can depend on
you to let us know when we need
to advocate for that expansion.
OK and Madam chair if I can just
add to that, you know when I
took this position in 2020 in at
the end of 2019, you know, in
the 2020 session, the
Legislature did provide the
funding that we needed both to,
um do the assessments to hire
appropriate staff and that has
and you can see that reflected
in what we've been able to do in
these last few years, And so I
want you to number one feel like
you deserve the credit for that,
but also see that we are
returning it. We hope you feel
we're returning.
Um, on your investment. So we
thank you for that. Most
definitely. And, um, also, um
Can
I'm not sure. Um
On the federal PFOs changes. Can
you explain how that is
impacting some of you cover that
and I just
Madam chair. Thanks for that.
Thank you for that question, I
think that there are a number of
changes that will are underfoot
as a result of the EPA's listing
of PFOs and PFO is a hazardous
contaminant. One of the issues
is the lawsuits that, um, that
that were mentioned earlier that
the attorney general and the
Environment Department have
brought against the Air Force
bases specifically, um, canon
that until EPA listed it, the
the Air Force was also
challenging and the environment.
Right to regulate FIFA and
people on the basis and and for
that reason, there's a lot of
work now happening with DOD to
develop plans for monitoring as
well as to that that sort of
acknowledged that the state now
does have that authority under
cercla to to regulate these
matters. I think that that is
the biggest change for the
state is that the state now can
actually take action through the
environment department through
our through our
See with the the authority that
the trustee has given through
the natural resource damages,
Um, act and the that that now we
are ready that for the last
year, I. I believe you've heard
us talk about our our our
preparations for this moment,
And now that this moment has
happened, we are working closely
with our sister agencies as well
as with the attorney general's
office to make sure that we
don't step on each other's toes
so that we work together in
concert on behalf of the state
of New Mexico in a way that
actually gets to some resolution
more quickly.
More slowly.
Oh, that's great news. Um, thank
you, and also, um
Uh, we are. Well, the issue of
the, um
Remedy. Um
With the White Sands Test
facility, and, um
Do we need to, uh, send another
letter of support to urge them
or do you think
Um, some of these other changes.
With EPA.
I know PFOs wasn't one of the
major things in the white sands
contamination. But other Chem
madam chair members of the
Committee and again Thank you
for the letter that you have
previously sent, Um
I would like
To to take a rain check on that
and maybe reach out to you as we
see how things are progressing
over the coming months. Um
Senator Heinrich last week had
the opportunity to, um
Ask some questions of NASA, Uh,
Director Bill Nelson, Former
Senator Nelson. Um, about this
specific, um, question. How are
things going with, uh, the
settlement negotiations and, um
Senator, Nelson said. We are
taking it very seriously. Um
Hoping to move forward. So, um
you know, there are there are
some conversations going on
between enemy and NASA technical
staff to try and remove this
roadblock that the Department of
Justice sees to any
communications with us, And so,
um
I wanna give that a chance. But
again, we saw some movement
following your letter. And so we
may, um
You know that may become helpful
in the future. Thank you.
Great. I'm glad to hear that,
Um, also, we are going to be in,
Um Almo Gordo, October 15th for
a committee meeting. And, um, we
would welcome you to, um, speak
on How those up, Um anything
else that you would like to
So I think that covers
everything. Just thank you again
for all of your efforts we
really appreciate hearing good
news and good things at San
Juan. And then as other, um,
settlements you know, are made
that was communities anyone
else? OK, thank you again.
OK, so we're continuing to be 15
minutes ahead of schedule, but I
see that, um
Good morning.
And, um, this will be an
overview of the state land
offices, regulation of
radioactive and hazardous
materials. Um
Commissioner of public Lands. Um
Stephanie Garcia, Richard.
Hello? Yeah, You're not supposed
to move those with it on
Makes loud noises. You can turn
it off and move it.
Good morning, madam chair and
members.
So just before we get started,
Um
I You can see that I am joined,
uh, by land office staff here,
So I just wanna, uh, introduce
these folks, uh, both for your
minutes, but also for expert
questions should be all directed
here because these are truly the
experts at the land office. So,
uh, Madam Chair this morning,
I'm joined by Greg Bloom, who
some of you may recall from many
years of service in the state,
But for me, he is the assistant
commissioner of mineral
resources.
Which includes pretty much
everything we cover today, um,
Uranium, clean up oil and gas
leasing. Uh, compliance work.
Um, the whole tech site
everything.
In our presentation is under
Greg's purview with the state
Land office. So, um, he's here
to help with technical
questions. We also have chase
Hensler
Uh and Joey Keith. So chase is a
My policy analyst at the Land
office worked here actually, at
the Legislature, uh, for a
session, And so it's familiar
with you all and and your
processes joke is Assistant
Commissioner of Communications
at the Land office.
All right.
I feel like I can't touch
anything. I'm gonna just
All right, so hopefully it won't
be reactive to page's turning.
Um
So in general, we were asked to
give, uh, overview of the state
Land office. I hope everyone got
a packet. Yes.
OK, well, the
Uh, overhead gets put up. Uh,
you can just follow along in the
packet. This is basically our
agenda today, uh, to go over our
legal and regulatory framework,
we do this every single time we
present to anyone.
Um, just to remind folks where
our jurisdiction is, Uh, where
our oversight is That kind of
thing. We're gonna talk
specifically about the whole
tech and storage facility. Uh,
site.
Our remediation and reclamation
efforts. Uh, uranium mining
cleanup, and then we'll have
time for questions. So just to
remind everyone and I'm sure uh,
those of you who have been
around for a while can recite
this with me. But we have
oversight, uh, of New Mexico's
13 million acres.
It's 9 million surface 13
million mineral but essentially
13 million acres. Um, and we use
those public acres to lease.
For to draw revenue for New
Mexico's public schools,
universities and hospitals. We
have any variety of lease on
state land that you can possibly
think of, um, renewable energy
leases, commercial leases, oil
and gas leases. Mining leases
housing leases, um in each of
your communities. Actually, I
was looking around the room, um,
at the communities that you
represent. We have a lease in
probably all of your districts.
Uh, maybe with the exception of
Representative Chandler Church,
Chandler, but we just acquired
state land in Los Alamos County.
So we will shortly be, uh,
Looking at at what to do with
that land.
Um our leases have language
within them.
That above and beyond our
requirements as state land
office say that the lessee has
to be in compliance with all
local
State.
And federal
Um
Uh,
Yeah. Loss, right?
So you know, for for
Folks in, uh Berno Leo County,
for example.
If you lease state land.
You have to comply with zoning
regulations of that particular
locale.
Um, we feel like that's a good
way to not sort of come in and
and be the bully in the room and
and, you know, do what we want
with State land. We want to be
good.
Neighbors, good partners, and so
we ask our lessees to be in
compliance with all of those
regulations.
Um, we also have in our leases a
number of enforcement
mechanisms. We ask our lessees
to be compliant environmentally.
With any kind of, uh, use of
state land. If there is a spill,
it needs to be cleaned up. If
there's uh, issues with, um
You know, air pollution that
needs to be addressed, and so we
use that compliance.
Language within our leases.
To compel our lessees.
To do the right thing to clean
up their messes to ensure that
they are operating, you know.
A clean
Operation on state land.
Um, The Albuquerque Journal just
recently, Um, did a series on
Well plugging, um, environmental
compliance. Uh, Today's story
was on, um, cleanup and well
plugging in the San Juan Basin
up in the northwest part of the
state, but the first two issues
so it started on Sunday. Uh,
we're on this the Southeast and
our efforts Well, plugging clean
up and and things like that in
the southeast portion of the
state. So we did include, um,
those article.
In your packet because they've
got some great photos. I mean, a
picture kind of, says 1000
words. You know, we I couldn't
say more than those pictures do.
Um, And for those of you who
have been to those areas for
those of you who live in those
areas, you you, You know the
reality on the
So, um, Whole Tech is 1000 acre
piece of property in the
southeast part of the state. Um,
which had a proposal for interim
storage of, um
High level nuclear waste so
spent fuel from
The US S. Uh,
Nuclear
Facilities.
You may not know or you may that
state land office actually owns
the mineral estate.
Below the proposed
Storage site.
Um, there are a number of
activities that are ongoing on
that on that piece of property
there.
Um, when the applicant which is
whole Tech, um, went to the NRC
The uh, Nuclear Regulatory
commission to apply for the
license to do this storage.
We found a number of
Inaccuracies, even
falsifications within their
application, and I'll just give
one example the falsely claimed
that they had sight control.
Essentially that they had had a
an agreement with the state land
office. Um
For the for control of the
mineral estate at that site, Um
More recently, and you probably
already know this. So I'm just
you know, letting you you I'm
reminding you, um, that the
fifth Circuit Court of Appeals
recently vacated
Their license, both for the
Texas facility and the New
Mexico facility. And that was a
suit that was brought by, um
some oil and gas operators, Uh,
in Texas, who are actually
operate also in New Mexico. Um,
and they were successful,
however, that particular
decision
Will probably now go to the
Supreme Court for review.
Here, uh, something you already
know. And I know that you know
this because I was on this
committee all of the spent
nuclear fuel sites throughout
the US.
As well as the two proposed
interim.
Um, facilities and then the
repository proposed repository
in Nevada.
So here's the activity within
that area that I was just
talking about the little green
rectangle in the middle of
slide. Six.
Is the proposed interim site.
And surrounding that you can
see, uh
Oil wells gas.
Activity.
Salt water injection wells.
Um, there is a lot going on in
this area.
I wanna apologize for the fact
that, uh, on the map
Active.
And new drilled but not
completed. Wells kind of has a
very similar, um, icon. I didn't
notice that until I was just
looking at it, and so
Hopefully, we can do something
about that for future maps, But,
um in general, you get the gist.
There's a lot of activity
happening.
More specifically on state land.
We've got an EOG lease there at
the north end.
Um, there is a bunch of XTO
activity. Um, if you look to so
the the green again, the green
outline is the proposed, uh,
interim footprint.
And all of the activity to the
Northeast there on state land
again on on mineral estate is,
uh, XTO leases. We've got
another oil and gas lease. Uh,
VO.
2770-2
Um And then, uh, both HP and MO,
uh are intrepid leases.
So, um, Potash mining.
Oil and gas development.
All within this region.
I guess that's to say, um, that
we are watching the whole tech
application. Uh, process very
carefully. We care about it at
the State Land office because it
impacts us very directly.
And our ability to, uh, utilize
our land in that area.
It impacts our lessees in that
area very directly.
I'm gonna move now to talking
about our remediation and
reclamation efforts. Uh, in
2020. We, uh, designed an
enforcement and accountability
program.
And essentially, it was the
first time the state land office
had had a well rounded. Look at
our lease. Look at activity on
state land to ensure that we had
environmental compliance from
our lessees.
Um you'll see there that you
know. So we went through, Um
And look for bonds that all of
our leases had and to ensure
that there was a bond in place,
because, remember that a bond
means if something goes wrong
with a company if something goes
wrong with the operation, the
state is not on the hook.
For what's left behind.
Um, we we found, um, we have
found AAA group of leases that
were not compliant. But of those
folks.
Most people understood when we
came to them to say, Hey, you
need a bond in place that that
was a requirement of leasing
state land. We had only a
handful.
Of people that pushed back on
having a bond.
Um, likewise if we had inactive
wells that hadn't been properly
plugged on state land, um
We went to the companies to
compel them to plug the wells at
their own dime. Um, on their at
their own cost. Um, and we only
had a handful of companies that
that you know, didn't think it
was their responsibility to plug
their own.
Infrastructure.
So we have had a few, um
Cases taken to court and I'll
talk about one in particular.
Uh, later in the presentation,
but by and large
Companies that use state land
understand their obligation.
It is a public resource, and
they
Partner with US.
To operate responsibly on state
land. By and large, we have had
compliance.
We realized very early on in
that enforcement and
accountability program that we
needed in house expertise around
environmental compliance. It's a
It's a whole, um
Sort of body of knowledge. Uh,
that is very technical.
Very science based
Um And so, at first we started
just by contracting with folks
who had that knowledge, but the
Legislature did authorize us to
open an environmental compliance
office that we have staffed with
internal land office. People. Um
And they are responsible for
things like close out plans, Uh,
ensuring that that whatever the
company proposes in terms of
cleanup is sufficient and meets
our our needs. Um, And so those
folks mostly are in the, um,
Southeast part of the state.
They they office out of that
area because that is where most
of the work occurs. Um, And if
you read the article, you'll see
some of them mentioned in in
that article.
And then I did mention bonding,
But we are trying to ensure, uh
that all of our leases are
properly bonded.
Because when they are not, that
means the cost falls to either
the land office to pick up. That
means the school kids pay for
cleanup.
Or it falls to the taxpayer.
I always have to include a nice
picture of local hills. Um, if
you have not driven
The highway.
Through local hills.
It's an experience.
I truly
Um, yeah, Some of you live in
this area, so you know
But, um, the the first time that
I drove it, uh
I had always heard about it, but
I didn't actually see it in
person. Um, till just a few
years ago, and so it's, uh
It's old.
Oil fields. Um
Like Greg says 40 Acre spacing
so you can see. I mean, they are
just right on top. Um, some of
the older uh, vertical wells
that used to be drilled in New
Mexico before we went to
horizon.
So here's, uh, the case that was
Highlighted and showcased in the
UM Albuquerque Journal article.
So this is an operator that, um
is out of Texas. They, um, don't
have a lot of, uh, operation in
New Mexico. But you can see the
state of their New Mexico lease.
We did just receive summary
judgment on this case. We are
waiting now, Um, To hear of
what? What the court will decide
in terms of damages.
Um, but this is one of the
operators like I said, who you
know, didn't feel like this.
What you see before you was
their responsibility to clean up
And so we
Took them to court to compel
them to do so. And now they will
be required to
Uranium activity on state land,
So we do have two legacy,
uranium leases and and by
legacy. I mean that their mining
leases that I did not sign they
were put into agreement before
my time.
Um neither has current mining
operations on them, so it's new
fuels and rock a Honda. I'm
apologize for the spelling.
Uh, but it should be. Roca HOND,
a
Um, you can see the terms of of
the leases there. I'll just
mention that the new fuels
lease, uh, is near Church Rock.
And you all know the the legacy
of Church Rock and and the you
know, largest uranium tailing
spill in the history of the
nation. We actually just looked
it up.
Um, I will talk about the
contamination, Uh, on San Mateo
Creek Basin in just a second.
And, uh, we are collaborating
with our sister agencies. In
fact, I just wanted to give a
shout out to trustee Hart.
Stebbins. Um, we're we're
working with her office as well.
You know she's been working on
cleanup since before she became
a trustee at the Environment
Department, Uh, back when she
was a county commissioner. Um,
so these
Issues are are long standing in
our state. Um and
We've there have been folks
working on this for a long time.
Um
And just so you know my
commitment.
To the state of New Mexico to
the land offices that I don't
create anything new before I
leave office, and then I do my
part.
To compel cleanup of state land
before I leave.
Alright. So more specifically
the San Mateo Creek Basin. This
is, uh in Silla County.
And the two blue dark blue
squares black, maybe dark blue
squares. Those are the state
land sections.
This is actually an EPA cleanup
project that we are working with
them on.
You can see the heat map there
of contamination to stand on the
state land sections for an hour.
We'll give you the same dosage
as a chest X Ray.
By experts.
This is nasty stuff.
And it's you know, as far as I'm
concerned, um, before we do any
additional extraction.
We need to address some of these
legacy issues.
And we're behind the ball on
doing so.
And New Mexico has really paid
the price.
But I'm sure that concludes my
presentation today and I stand
for questions.
Thank you.
Um, are there any questions from
the committee?
Thank you, Madam Chair
Commissioner. Great to be with
you, Greg. Great to be with you
and your team. Uh, when I first
tip my hat to you, commissioner,
uh, cause we had kind of a full
circle moment this morning. And,
um, now you're here so I could
give you a little credit. We, uh
we changed the law when we
stopped.
When we ban the storage of high
level nuclear waste in New
Mexico. Part of what we did in
that law was we closed the
loophole in the radioactive
consultation Task force.
Which are now a part of which I
don't think included you before,
but it also only dealt with
federal facilities and you were
on this committee and we had a
presentation, and they said it
only deals with federal
facilities and you circle that
and you go.
Big loophole.
And we closed it, and now
they're looking at private
waste.
And so thank you, because I mean
we strengthen the radioactive
task force. And today we heard
from
Em nerd talking about all their
good, proactive work looking at
those things, which is exactly
what we wanted, but
You were the person who picked
up on that. So kudos to you and
your former legislative life.
Um
I. I just wanna also applaud you
for your work on trying to
capture a market rate.
For our our leases.
You know?
That's just, uh
That's just business. I mean,
you know, we have a commodity
here in the state. That's
World class. It's extremely
sought after it's extremely
valuable.
As fiduciaries. We are
responsible.
For being competitive and are
least structure that money ends
up going to our kids.
Going to our state.
And, uh, it's just the business
friendly thing to do. We talk
about business That's very pro
business and
Competition and
All those things. And, um, I
think
While you have a mandate to get
a return, you do not have a
mandate to give stuff away and
You know, especially
At the moment at which it's most
valuable. So anyway, I applaud
you for your work on that and
hanging tough and, um
Being good stewards in New
Mexico's resources, you and your
team
Thank you. That's all I have
now. Sure.
Thank you, Um, representatives.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you for your presentation.
Always great listening to what
you're doing in the in the land
office on Page three. It says
leases are also required
complaints with other state and
federal laws and regulations.
How do you deal with so gas and
oil flaring Rampant, flaring is
is that happening in state land
or just everywhere else?
And how do you deal with? Uh
Yes, it is happening on state
land. And in fact, we, um
The, uh
Energy Department very
graciously allowed us to be part
of building the rule to, uh, I
compel capture of of emissions.
Um, and for us on state land
Having the rule in place
actually helps us because, you
know
We will commodified everything.
And so in our view, Not only is
are the emissions, the venting
and flaring uh, you know, an
environmental and health
concern, But that is a resource
that is, you know, as far as
we're concerned, being wasted,
and so that, um, the passage of
that rule, uh around capture
allows us the state Land office
to hold our lessees. Our
operators, uh, accountable for
their for their capture.
Is there good complaints?
Well, so like everything, Um, I
think compliance in in most
cases has to be compelled. Um
and we just are appreciative
that the rule allows another
tool in our compliance. Toolbox
is what it is. So I'm not gonna
say that there's you know, 100%
compliance. Um, I think that if
Any data you look at says that
emissions are continuing at an
alarming rate. Um, so we are
just getting kind of our arms
around holding folks compliant
on state land in particular.
That's all I have. Thank you.
Uh, Senator Pope.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Commissioner. Great seeing
you again.
Um, looking at
Page eight.
And you talk about your
remediation and reclamation
efforts and you talked about,
uh, the environmental compliance
Office enforcement and
accountability program, And I
think these
Of what are what you've stood
up.
And so the question I have
Are these anywhere in our laws
or statutes? Is this something
that could be reversed? Once you
left the office?
Um, Madam Chair and senator.
Phenomenal question. So, uh, let
me just
Preface it by my answer by
saying that as I am eyeing
The exit door at the state Land
office, right? I've got 2.5
years left there.
We are really trying to think
about what we would like to
leave behind how we want to
ensure that either culture
policy rule or statute remains.
Everything you see in front of
you hear?
You know is policy and rule.
None of this is statutory.
I. I would say that the terms in
the lease those are statutory
but whether or not a future
commissioner holds lessees to
the terms of the lease.
That's policy and rule at this
point.
Um, I would welcome you know any
assistance in codifying
Good practice codifying,
ensuring that state land is
being used appropriately that we
have responsible lessees out on
our public resource. Um, but
that's a great question, sir.
Uh, thank you, Manager. Thank
you, Commissioner I. I just
think this is what we need to
ensure happens in the future in
the office.
And so
Um
I love to work with you. I think
some other folks here would as
well but I think going forward
whoever is in the office, no
matter the party or whoever it
is.
These are policies that we need
to ensure
Continue in the future.
I. I also wanna commend you
also, um what the vice chair
stated, Um as far as the
Making sure that we're getting
market value.
On these leases.
I think people forget that.
It's not my oil. It's not oil
and gasses oil. It's
Resource of the citizens of New
Mexico.
And we should be getting our
fair share market value. That's
what I hear all the time, right?
So
Um, thank you for stepping up,
ensuring that that happens.
Um, I think we need to also do
something in our end. I know
we've tried here, uh, in this
session to make that do it
again. Llama will try again.
But just thank you for, uh,
doing that. Um, this is really
how we're gonna ensure that
We take care of our future
generations in the state, So
it's so important. Thank you,
Commissioner. Thank you, madam
Chair.
Senator Rodriguez. Thank you,
Madam Chairman. And, uh, Good
morning, uh, to our commissioner
and staff. Thanks for your
presentation. I couldn't be here
for the entire presentation as I
was here in my office in another
meeting, but I, I, uh want to
commend you also, I'll let go.
Most of the comments. You've not
all that have been made because
this has been a very difficult
issue. Very, um, just a moving
issue from all all areas because
you think about safety. You
think about health concerns. You
think
About the environment and people
and and then there's a division
as we know that's clear as to
how people feel about some of
the things we go through with
land and and the the flaring and
and all the other things we've
been talking about, But, um,
that being said, you have
approached your job. Um, very,
very, um, conscientiously, and,
uh, I just want you to know that
we appreciate that very much.
Um, you know you you underscored
a very and probably the
Most important thing we can
think of, And that is that
policy is pivotal.
We can have
Many goals and, um
In ways to do things in in
opinions. But if we don't have
the policy in place, and
especially with respect to the
statutory clarity that we need,
we're obviously missing in a
Sandra Pope, madam chairman
mentioned there's work to do
from our end, too. We're missing
the statute
language clearly, um, as we set
policy
Um And we need to do that. So
thank you. So thank you. Any
other committee members have
questions?
Or comments.
Hey.
Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, Go ahead.
Send this
Madam chair. I understand I'm
short, but, um
yes.
Uh, I want to refer to your
other handout you have in there.
Um, I noticing here you have a
number of lawsuits filed on
these.
Spiel. Legacy issues are those
ones that we have currently
That we found in in suing for is
that in 2024, you only showed
two
Is that correct?
Uh, Madam Chair and Senator,
That is correct. So we started
this program. I believe the, uh,
fall of 2020.
OK, so you have the the number
of lawsuits we had for each
fiscal year after that, and this
year? Um, we we have to
currently that that have been
filed. Um and you know, we I. I
don't have necessarily the
outcome of those suits listed
Some of them, um, have been
settled and and you know things
of that nature, but in general,
uh,
Those metrics show how many were
filed each of the years of the
program.
Appreciate clarification on
that. So looking at this when I
live in Lee County, Um and I do
a lot of driving out in the oil
field, uh, not seeing anything
like this, But if I understand
your numbers, right, you have
two and 24. But you have 54,000
Wells.
Is that correct? It's a little
further up.
Um, I guess, um, let me see what
the 54,000 is referring to.
A five
I. I actually didn't keep a copy
for myself. Unfortunately, I'm
not sure what the 54,000 is
referring to. Possibly Wells and
State land. Yeah.
I apologize.
Yes. OK, so that is the total
number of wells. Um, so total
oil and gas wells on state land
54,000 total number of injection
Wells, 3000 and total number of,
uh oil and gas related wells
1000 of 54,000. We only have
problems with two. Is that
correct?
We're showing on.
Correct.
OK, I just wanted to clarify
because, uh, picture look at
like we are.
Frank Contaminate New Mexico re
reality is you only have two of
54. So that's how many suits
have been filed this year. And
just if I could remind you, uh,
and the committee, Madam chair
of something I said earlier, and
that is
Taking operators taking lessees
to court is a last resort We
have brought many companies into
compliance just through
negotiating terms, negotiating
cleanup. Uh, project plans, So
the suits are are a last resort
and and the total number of
suits of of all of the years of
the program, Madam Chair is 30.
Correct. I saw that. Uh, I guess
my thought is it goes back to
commodity of that oil could be
sold for them, so it's usually
due to an accident or
Negligence, But, uh I just want
to make sure that you and the
others understood that it's not
common operations.
It's an accident or negligence.
So it's all
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you to all of your efforts for
for ensuring that we have a
clean environment here in New
Mexico as well. Um, I know this
is a particular personal passion
of yours. Um And so, I. I do
appreciate all of the work that
you've done.
So I, uh, entered the state Land
office. Uh, five years ago with
a staff. I believe of a
compliment of about 100 and 50
FT. We are now, um, almost at
100 and 80 FT. And the reason
is, um all of the programs that
I mentioned in my presentation,
but also oil and gas development
is at an all time high. I think
we know that we see the revenue
coming in. So Greg was at the
Land office previous had the
same staff complement.
Deal with about like a a quarter
or a third of the work that his
staff deals with now, so we did.
We did staff him up. Um and, uh,
the Legislature was gracious and
has been in every single
expansion request that we have
come before you all to ask for
has been has been given to us.
So, uh, we at this current time
feel like we have, you know, a a
good complement of staff to do
the work and ensure that the
turnaround um
Of paperwork on state land to
lease state land is done in a
timely manner. Uh, but we we
have, you know.
We have historic workloads
happening at the State Land
office right now, so we needed
We needed that I would hate to
close the door on my 2025
request. Madam chair 2026, I
guess. 2026 request
One final question,
Commissioner.
A policy that I think we passed
in a statute, but I just want to
make sure was your work with
counties, giving them
opportunities to give feedback
before
A land use.
The land use decision by your
office.
That's something we worked on.
But Jen, you put it in a play.
So is that so? Yes, in 2019. You
all did pass a bill to mandate
Public meetings, so that doesn't
necessarily mean you know, JPs
with counties and things like
that, which we do in practice,
But there is a mandate around,
Um, any large land deal. So any
large development Uh large wind
farm, a land sale. A land swap
has to go before the community,
which is being impacted. Um, in
terms of a public meeting, So a
good example of this is, uh,
just recently, we had a series
of public meetings in
Albuquerque around a proposed
land exchange there.
Well, kudos to you for that,
because that was something we
tried to do legislatively before
you became commissioner. We were
fought on it, and it's just a
respectable thing to do. I mean,
we had a really bad land
commissioner who came in and
Started giving away land deals
that were going to literally add
40% to the size of Los Cruces
without any discussion with the
local government consideration
of natural resources, water,
etcetera. So, um, we needed to
build in that step of consulting
with local communities, and you
did it.
And kudos to that, and by
Constitution. We cannot
I think your office has the
authority to then make a
decision.
But we did have the statutory
power to
Build in a step there so good to
know that some statute cause
that might have been one of
those things that we should have
codified while you're there. So
Good work on that, too. Thanks,
man.
And just one other thing. Thank
you for, um, helping us with
the, uh, resistance of Holt. Um,
approval, you know, pointing out
all the different
Um
You know, failures and you know
this information, especially
where it regarded, um
The state Land office and
Um
I hope and I'm glad that, um
Greg, you're on. Is that right?
The radioactive, Um
Hazardous. Uh, task force. I
probably didn't say that
completely. That is correct.
They have been reaching out to
us, and I've been one of the
designees to that. That task
force. Yes.
OK, great.
OK, Um, thank you so much
Appreciate your spending The
morning and
You have three more years, two
more years.
2.5 but who's counting?
But thank you. Yeah, it's like,
Oh, now that we're
You've done a great job. Thank
you very much.
OK, we are
Lunch break. OK, so we're a
little bit ahead of time. Um,
let's pretend we're gonna be
back at one.
And then everybody will be here
by 115.
Yes, we do need a quorum again.
Well, no, we've established
forums. So thank you all. Um OK,
have a nice lunch and we'll see
you at
No later than 1215, so we can
get done.
I mean, yes. 115.
