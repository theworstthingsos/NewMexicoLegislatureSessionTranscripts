Good morning, everybody. Welcome
to the third day of
the Les C meeting here
in Los Lunas again. I
want to thank Las Lunas
uh school
schools and the
people. I didn't have one,
but I heard that the cinnamon rolls
were amazing and thank them for the
credible hospitality
and such. I believe
we've got a half day today,
but our first presentation
is the School Leader Preparation
and Principal Residencies
program. And
so, Annie, I think you're kind of
leading this for us if
you would please.
>> Absolutely. Good morning,
Mr, chair members of the
committee. My name is Annie
Armitage and I'm your senior
analyst covering educator
workforce. And I'd like
to introduce you to my co
presenters this morning. I'm
joined by Michael Weinberg,
Senior Education
Policy Officer at the Thornberg
Foundation and Phoebe
Valene, assistant Division
Director of Educator Quality
at PE D. And this
morning, we have a joint presentation
for you on principal preparation.
And I just like to frame this
conversation a little bit for you
first. So you all
appropriated $2
million for educator
preparation programs to
plan and pilot principal
residency programs in fy
24
and PE D use philanthropic
funds to organize a community
of practice with Ed with
educator preparation preparation
programs, guided
by national policy
experts to really
carefully lay some critical
groundwork for those
principal residencies to make
sure they're implemented
well.
And that working group produced
a set of recommendations
to better align principal prep
preparation in general
in the state with best
practices. And many
of those recommendations were
included in House Bill 22
that you all endorsed in this year's
session. And we'll be bringing
some of those ideas back to you
in this interim for further
consideration,
you all also appropriated
$20 million
annually for educator
clinical practice through the grow
fund over the next three
years. And pe D
has indicated some intention
to spend a portion of those funds on
principal residencies going
forward. Now just
shifting a tiny bit a few months
ago, Les E staff had the
opportunity to visit Chicago
public Schools and
the University of Illinois, Chicago
to learn more about how
Illinois has adopted
and implemented principal
preparation best practices.
So this morning, I'm gonna start by
sharing some of the lessons we
learned on that visit with you.
Uh Then Michael is going to
describe how stakeholders
have really come together in New
Mexico to lay a
strong foundation for a lot of
that same work here.
And then finally, Phoebe will
provide you with an update on how
that $2 million appropriation
was spent as
well as how the R FA
that recently went out
for principal residencies
in the 2025. School
year has really been
carefully crafted to help
ensure that principal residencies
in New Mexico are
aligned with best
practices.
So to get
started,
why is school leadership
important? You all heard
from former Les C
analyst, Emily Hoxie last
year? Uh quite a bit of, of
information about this. If you want to
learn more about the research behind
this, there's a lot that's her
brief is a great place to look.
But in short evidence
demonstrates that improving school
leadership can improve student
outcomes in terms of
proficiency attendance,
graduation and beyond,
it can also improve teacher
retention and literature
is quite clear that turning around
failing schools is
not going to happen without effective
school leadership.
And investing in school leadership
is a really cost effective way to
get out all of these outcomes we
hope to
see.
So you may be wondering why we're
talking to you about Chicago and
Illinois here in New Mexico.
And we are because
Illinois has received a lot of
national recognition for the
principal preparation work
that they have done
over the last 20 years.
And within Illinois, Chicago
public schools has really been a
driver of a lot of that
change. One
of the interesting takeaways I had
uh when I went to visit them was
just that so much of the
ongoing work in New Mexico
is really closely aligned
with making many of
these best practices we saw
there happen
here.
So on this slide, what I really
want your takeaway to be
is that in Illinois, this was
a long process, it was
almost 20 years
uh to get from when they really,
and Ernest started looking at principal
quality in 2006
to being able to really see the
strong outcomes that they're seeing.
Now, we're trying to make that
happen a little faster in New
Mexico. But they were quite
clear to us
um that
this magic doesn't happen
overnight. There are a
few uh pieces
on this timeline that I'd like to
draw your attention to.
The first is in 2010.
And that's when Illinois strengthened
principal license requirements
through statute.
At the same time, the state
tasked the education
agency with revising
educator preparation
program requirements in
rule. And that's exactly
what HB 22
intended to do for New
Mexico.
And if you back up just a little bit
to 2007,
you can see that Chicago public
Schools established a department
of Principal Quality.
This is a district level
department, it would be akin
to AP S doing something like
this in New Mexico. And
when we spoke with the officials there,
they said this was actually
really important for making
sure that there were resources,
staff and this attention
consistently focused on
this over time to ensure
some stability.
And if you jump all the way to
the end of the timeline in
2020 you'll see
that at the state level, Illinois
actually followed suit
and created a department of
district and school leadership
at the state level to ensure
that statewide this attention
was being um kind
of continued. And
in New Mexico, HB 22
also intended to do
something similar like this in
New Mexico at the state
level.
So research shows
six primary features
of effective principal preparation
programs. The
first is deliberate
recruitment and selection of
principal candidates. That's
one ensuring the
caliber and quality
and preparedness of candidates who are
going in. But it's also
being really intentional on the
part of districts to know
where they're gonna need principles
and when and actively
developing that
pipeline.
The next is close
partnerships between
universities with administrator
preparation programs
and the school districts where they're gonna
be working.
The third is a cohort structure
among those principal candidates
and ensuring they have strong
mentoring built in for
them. The
next is coherent
curriculum at those
preparation programs that's
aligned to state and national
standards. And
I would add really closely
uh kind of reactive
to the expectations of
school districts, what they need their
administrators to come
with a
robust clinical experience,
usually a residency
program and then
ensuring that you're tracking
candidates after they leave the
programs, uh collecting
that data to know whether your
programs are doing what you
intend for them to
do.
So, I'm gonna focus in on a
few of these uh
features of effective
preparation programs in the
context of Illinois and
Chicago. So
when we were visiting Chicago,
we were really kind of focusing
in on this um
probably the strongest
partnership that Illinois
has. And it was driven
by the demand from Chicago
public schools. So it, it actually
wasn't driven by educator
preparation programs.
It was Chicago public school
district telling educator
preparation programs, this is
what what we expect of
candidates when they get here. And this is
what we need and then
working with them uh
to really kind of
fine tune all of that over
time.
So
rigor was a really
important part of what the
district wanted and the EP
PS responded to that. So
principal candidates um
through this program have
to first pass a
district, a selection
process and then
have to pass a selection
process of
the university.
And in both of those processes,
candidates have to demonstrate
evidence of their
instructional efficacy
and student data
over a period of
time. Um is part
of that application
process.
The curriculum at the university
focuses on issues faced
by leaders in urban schools.
That's the, you know, they're
in Chicago, those are the skills they
need. Ours would be different
um in some ways.
And that curriculum has to be
aligned to both the state of
Illinois principal standards
as well as national standards.
And it's really closely aligned
again, with everything
the district talks about and their
professional development for
principals.
Then finally,
the selection of mentor
principal also includes
a comprehensive application
proc process. Not everybody
can be a mentor principal. They want
to make sure that their new
principals are working
with some of the most experienced
and effective in the district
and those mentors are
compensated
and the state agency does con
conduct accountability
checks um
on all of that.
And I want to point out that of
the districts in Illinois who
don't have these strong partnerships
with preparation programs have
not seen nearly as
promising outcomes as
this one
has.
So focusing in a little bit
on that robust clinical
experience, I talked
about selective recruitment,
they require a year-long
paid residency um as
part of this preparation
program and
residents are paid at least
$90,000
or higher to match
their current teaching salary.
And the district actually
funds these. So these are
are district funded
residencies. The
university coach, uh university
trains coaches who
support residents and
mentors. This is
actually a really important
accountability piece that I
hadn't thought about before. And when
we spoke with those
co uh coaches,
they talked about going into
schools and
basically making sure that
these mentor principal
are providing
the candidates really
robust um
residency experiences
and meeting the goals of the
residents themselves.
And the principals are supported
for a few years with,
you know, a little less robustly
following graduation
and those program graduates
must commit to serving as a
principal in their sponsoring
district for at least four years,
which is an important piece for the
districts who are funding
these.
So we all know that data is
very important in the
right place. It's
important on the front end to make
sure districts know where
they need to focus their recruitment
efforts. When and where
are they gonna need more principal,
as well as on the back
end, they need to know where
do their new principles go?
How long do they stay there?
Are they effective? And
if they do leave, why are they
leaving? And
initially illinois' State
had tried to
collect a lot of this personal
shortage data
and their response rate was
really low and the data was pretty
unusable. So they
actually shifted to
partnering with a
private contractor to
survey superintendents
on the school personnel
shortages. They now have
an 99% response
rate and they're able to
use this uh data
really strategically, it
includes vacancy rates,
movement of personnel
reasons for leaving the district
or the profession,
district methods that they're
using to address storages
as well as staff
perspectives on policy
solutions.
So that's to collect this
particular piece of data.
They also have something called the
Illinois workforce
education research
collaborative, quite
a mouthful, but it is a
collaboration between
private contractors and
higher education in
Illinois. And they work
together to analyze this
data and a whole host
of other data that they get
um including state
agency data all the way
from early childhood
through the workforce.
And they use this data to
produce reports and
analysis for
school districts, state
agencies and other
stakeholders.
And in this particular
context, it's really important to
help districts strategically
ensure there's always somebody
on the bench when a principal is
gonna
leave.
So what is this resulted in
in Chicago?
Um there's been some pretty promising
outcomes. So if
we look at the principal
eligibility assessment
in Chicago, the first
trip pass rate for program
graduates, that's
graduates from this kind of
collaboration for Chicago
public schools and
the um preparation
program, their program
graduates have a 90%
1st IPASS rate compared
to other uh non
graduates of
the program in Chicago. And
they have a 40%
1st time pass rate. So they appear
to be more
prepared
and then compared to other
schools in Chicago
schools that are led by these
program graduates have
had greater average student
proficiency growth, higher
high school graduation rates
and lower dropout rates.
And they found that they begin
to see these student growth
differences by the end of
the principal's first year on the
job.
So looking at principal
departure and transition
rates, you can see that
since they've started this
work, they've gone up and down
a little bit, but there's been a
downward decline
over the last 15 or
so
years
and you can't see the long term
trend in this chart.
But there is one
and over
time, the demographics of
principles in Chicago
have moved to be much more
diverse and are much closer now
to reflecting the diversity of
the student populations that they
serve.
So some of the key takeaways
that I had from my visit
were that planning
implementation and
then seeing results is a
long term process and doesn't
happen overnight
that close collaboration
between school districts
and the higher education programs
preparing school administrators
is an absolute
necessity.
Having rigorous expectations
and requirements is
important.
Having accountability measures,
whether that's the state
agency checking up on
different parts of the process
or having university coaches
ensure that mentors
principals are held accountable
and collecting data to evaluate
the programs. It's all
important collecting
that data.
And then just a quick note on breeded
funding that Illinois
has really quite
creatively
combined. State
funds, federal funds,
district funds and
philanthropic funds to keep
energy around this work
and make it
possible.
What's that? Turn it over to
Michael?
>> Thanks so much, Annie Mr,
chairman and members of the committee.
Thank you so much for having
me here today. I'm Michael Weinberg.
I'm a senior policy officer
with the Thornberg Foundation.
It's good to be with you again.
And um I just want
to add a little bit to what
Annie said that it, it's
really great when you go
somewhere to learn about
what they're doing
and they want to hear about
what you're doing. And
um what struck me is
that as a
state, we
are, we are really on the right
path and you
deserve the credit for that.
Your leadership over these
past few years,
I would say around
residencies in general,
you've done such great work
around teacher residencies
and this um
principal residencies builds
on that. So my
job today, let's
see. Um
Are you advancing slides or am
I? Ok, I can do
this um
is to give you
a brief
historical overview.
Uh Annie has touched on a little
bit of this, you know, this
story quite well. So,
um I'll just hit the highlights.
Um I'll talk about a bit
about what's going on with the
deans and directors and the
leadership work group um
both last summer, as well
as this summer. And then
we'll talk about um a
little bit where we think we're
headed as far as next
steps. Um
I should say, uh our
foundation, we
focused in a few
key policy areas,
water, land and
agriculture,
homelessness.
My area focuses
in education and
within education,
teacher
preparation,
principal preparation
CTE those tend to be
a few things that I I
spend time on. My
background is as an
educator, elementary
teacher, literacy coach,
and um recovering
school principal. So
that's what brings me to this
work
and he already touched on this.
The why in terms
of we know the importance
of leadership in
influencing school
outcomes. I think
Phoebe will talk about it as
well. It's just something
that we want to keep coming back
to that. This is
why we're focused on
leadership and we know
there's such leverage
when it comes to how we
prepare our principles.
There are
something like 900
of them in the state. And
it's a, it's a real
opportunity to make a
difference.
So I want to spend a little bit of
time
here
again, you, you know
this story, but
um going
back to
2022
Representative Garrett
and others on
this committee introduced a
memorial
that
directed us as a state
to look at how we prepare
principles. Um
The Albuquerque Chamber
actually uh
led a study,
worked with a couple of
consultants,
um Gina
and Erica, they, they'll
come up in conversation
pretty regularly and,
and that led to a, a
piece of legislation that
I know Senator Stewart took
great interest in and, and
has been um involved
with since its inception,
um wasn't quite
ready for prime time that
year. So we,
we pulled back and I think
wisely so,
um did a lot of
work this
last interim, which I'll, which
I'll talk more about um
particularly with the higher
education community.
Um
One of the things that
um did
happen in that session
though is an
appropriation for
$2 million to
begin planning
and um piloting
what principal residencies
would look like and I know that Phoebe
will talk more about that
as well.
Um What
I want to just
highlight
and I'll, I'll get to another
slide on this but is
the, is the work that that higher
ed group did um
last summer that
resulted in, in what
Annie has already described as
House Bill 22. So,
um that was, that was a
big piece of the work.
Um Another thing that
happened with
that appropriation and
moving across to,
to 2023
is awards were made
to the
um four of the
seven institutions
to begin in earnest
that planning process. The
other three also
received stipends. So they, they
were part of that planning process
and we, and
this is, you know, the royal
we, a group of
funders along with the
pe D
um put
some, some money together to
create a community of practice,
to help in that
planning process. So
that included the
Thornberg Foundation, the Landel
Foundation Kellogg
Foundation and Maddox
Foundation. I think it's a
nice example. You know, Phoebe, you
talked about, I'm sorry, any
in Chicago
um braided
funding and um
any time that we can
have the kind of public private
partnerships, um
I think that the the work is
strengthened. So um
that workgroup benefited
from, from that structure.
Um We've referenced it a couple
of times but in this
most recent session,
House Bill 22
was introduced
and um was
not um was not
given a message, but
um there was
we believe a
strong bipartisan
support for that.
Um And then as,
as Annie referenced, the, the
last thing is that
additional funding was
appropriated this year through
um the growth fund
broadly for residencies
including principal residencies
over a three year
period. And again,
that's something that
um the, the Chicago
folks who we talked with were
just amazed with
that the legislature is
already contemplating the
kind of sustainable funding
for this
effort.
I've referenced a couple of
times um
This workgroup
they presented to you last
fall. So I I won't
go into too
much detail, but
what stands out to me is
there was
really great
participation.
Um not only from the higher
education community. It's
a little bit hard to see. But
um the members themselves
were from each of the institutions
that are involved in principal
preparation. So Western
Eastern Highlands,
UN M University of the
Southwest New Mexico
State and CE
s um but,
but also
your committee staff were
really involved. I'm glad that you
referenced Emily.
She was uh very
involved. John was
there, Annie was there,
director prayer ornament was
there. It was fantastic.
Sonny was there
pe D was at the
table. Um
I find it quite refreshing
to see that kind of collaboration
going on. And
um in every chance I I
can I I compliment
us as a state for
working well together.
Um
What came of that
were really two big
recommendations. Um One
around program approval
standards. Um Those are,
those are listed here on the
slide,
any reference them, these
are the the six things
that we know um
make high
quality uh principal
preparation. The the biggest one
really being that yearlong paid
residency. And then the
second is this
idea of building
capacity within the public
education department to be
able to oversee this
work.
Um
11 last thing I'll say
is once those
recommendations were made,
the full dean and directors
group um
endorsed them.
Uh We did a lot of
work socializing
them around the state.
Um Talked with
superintendent rounds,
met with union
leaders, Phoebe and
I presented to the
School Principals
Association.
Um really try to get
feedback from
a broad and, and diverse group
of stakeholders on
that.
Let's see, as far as next
steps,
we are
right now in the process
of um
what I would call the leadership
workgroup 2.0
so last year that workgroup,
as I said, addressed program
standards
and capacity
at the public education
department, there was a
third set of
recommendations
that they, they
held off on taking
immediate action and it had to do
with licensure.
Um This is again,
not a new topic for
this committee.
Um But the
idea that we have one
administrative license
level three B that
covers
um all levels
of leadership.
So from building level up
to superintendent, um
kept coming up as a
question and we
kept very politely
saying, can we hold
off and deal with
that next summer? So
it is next summer
and um
like it or not, it's,
it's back on the table. So
that is the first big issue.
The second has to do
with um
a concern
around um
loopholes for
out of state or online
licensure. So
essentially, if
we
raise
program standards
for all of New
Mexico, we're trying
to raise the, the playing field
level, the playing field.
Um What we don't want is
this unintended effect of
then, um people
seeking licensure through
it an easier and
most likely less effective
route by going out of state.
So that's, that's a piece that,
that this group will look at
this summer as well.
Um And
what I would like to
offer is that uh to
the extent that this committee is
interested, we would love to keep
you updated on how that
work is going. Um
We, we really value
your, your questions and
contributions
and um your
expertise around this.
So
with that, I,
I just again, want to
express my
thanks and
um turn it over to
Phoebe.
>> Gotta change
it.
Well, I'll go ahead and just get
us started as uh
the slideshows being
pulled up. But um
so good morning, Mr, chair
members of the committee. Um I'm Phoebe
Valencic, the Assistant Director of
Educator Quality
and pleased to be
here today and present to you and the
principal pilot and how
the appropriation funding
was utilized uh this
past year in fy
24 and how we are
planning to utilize it in fy
25.
Um
I'll wait one second because this
is on the next slide.
But,
oh,
yes,
and the other two, I'm gonna move this
closer. You
started.
Yes, you're welcome.
Yes.
Well, maybe I'll introduce myself
one more time. Now. Can you hear
me a little bit better?
Ok. Well, good morning,
Mr, chair members of the committee.
Um I'm Phoebe Valencic. I'm the
Assistant Director of Educator
Quality for the New Mexico
Public Education Department.
Um I'm very honored to be here
presenting to you to you on
the principal pilot appropriation
funding and how it was
utilized in Fy 24
and how we plan to utilize it in
Fy
25.
So let me back
up.
Ok.
Um As Doctor Weinberg
and Annie had already highlighted
school leadership is a state
priority for many reasons,
but most importantly, because
strong leaders are
necessary for student
outcomes. Um
I would really like to thank our
legislature for prioritizing
school leadership. As
Doctor Weinberg said, we couldn't
do any of what we've been able
to accomplish in the past few years
without the funding that has been
appropriated for this.
Um And uh
the generous funding especially for
this principal pilot has allowed
us to do a lot in fy
24 and it will allow
even more in fy
25.
Today, I'm gonna provide an overview
of how these funds are being
utilized. And
our long term vision and goal
for school leadership prepa
preparation. As we move
forward,
school leaders across the
country are consistently
reporting uh feeling
underprepared for their leadership
roles and they lack
the skills necessary to
adequately lead school
improvement efforts.
For this reason, we are seeing
high turnover and
high turnover rates and an
overall decrease in
interest in the profession of school
leadership careers.
Our school leaders deserve
and require high quality
preparation that truly equips
them for the challenges
of the role
today.
Actually.
Sorry about that. As
Annie shared there are six critical
features uh of effective
school leadership and the most
foundational component for
effective school administrative
preparation is a robust
clinical experience.
And that's exactly what the funding
from this appropriation was aimed at
providing
research also suggests that a
full year of clinical practice
is key to providing
candidates with the most
robust experience
possible. However,
lengthening the time
that's required for clinical practice
to a full year is only as
valuable as the quality
of the candidate's experience within
that year. A
high quality residency
experience is the vehicle that will
also support the other critical
preparation features
in the use of these funds
pe D wanted to ensure
two things. First,
that a full year residency is
designed to provide
a truly robust experience
as the foundation for all
other uh
features. And
two second
that investing in
candidates that
we're really investing in candidates
that seek to become school
leaders in New
Mexico.
New Mexico's leaders deserve a
strong practice. Um
Currently, typical
preparation programs
are are only part
time less than 10
hours per week with
only about 100 and 80
hours of required clinical
practice. They
focus primarily on observation
and reflections
and mentors and coaches are
identified without selection,
selection criteria
criteria and rarely
receive uh any
training. So
alternatively, strong
practice is defined as
full year or full time
with at least 500 to
77 hun 500
to 700 hours.
Usually in a defined residency
experience, they're
given authentic opportunities
to practice leadership tasks
in a variety of
settings.
Ok. So
and candidates receive
feedback um
through formative assessment and
performing tasks
um from highly trained
coaches and
mentors.
Our goal is to support educator
preparation programs in their
transformation from typical,
typical practice to
strong practice.
With this goal in mind and with
deep consideration of the workgroup
discussions, we decided
to dedicate this first year
of the funding to planning
and capacity building
so that programs could
be prepared to effectively
pilot implementation
in the 2425 school
year, there were a
few key reasons that
we made this choice. First,
the funding timeline had already
been slightly delayed and
programs had not yet had the
opportunity to recruit
candidates or partner
with place for placement
and backfill plans.
And second discussions during the
workgroup meetings illustrated
the need for further learning.
So during the workgroup
meetings, it was clear
that there were some, there was a need
for further learning and some statewide
mind shifts around what
quality administrative prep
really requires.
And finally, there was a definite need
to support program understanding
and build their capacity
so that their programs could
effectively implement the
high qual the high
quality criteria that the workgroup
had
defined.
And you'll see that criteria here
on this slide,
the deans and directors work group
voted on and approved
these nine criteria
uh for high quality principal
residency. They
also discussed the necessary
program evolution that would
be needed to provide this
experience for their candidates.
None of the seven admin prep
programs felt equipped to
implement full year
residency in the 2324
school year
and based on Epp
feedback and or the
ed prep program feedback and the
express need for program
revision and capacity
building ped decided
to craft the fy 24
request for application
around a pre residency
planning and capacity and
capacity building.
In order to really effectively
implement an fy
25
we wanted to ensure that
the shift to full time full
year residency was done
well because
high-quality residency
supports all critical
areas of
preparation.
The fy 24 request for
application was focused around the
following goals,
understanding research, best
practices around the
qualities and criteria for
effective school administrative
prep supporting
all seven new Mexico
approved administrator
preparation programs and planning
and capacity building
so that they were set up to
successfully implement in
2425
developing high quality
statewide mentorship and
coaching, training
and collecting data to
inform policy decisions
and evaluate the pilot. Moving
forward.
This table breaks down how
the fy 24 funds
were allocated.
So 1.7 million
went to seven of the admin prep
programs based on their
applications and needs for
program revision. Uh
As Michael mentioned,
there were four programs
that really had a vision
and applied for the R
FA and received most of that
funding and the other
three received
smaller portions so that they
could participate and learn
alongside the other programs
uh in the community of practice
work.
60,000 supplemented
generously like Michael
was saying, from private
funding from Thornberg,
Lanell Kellogg and Maddox
Foundations was set
aside for the community of practice
sessions that were facilitated
by the education research and
development firm. Um
and Gina and Erica, that Michael
had also mentioned.
And then another 100 and
20,000 was allocated for
capacity projects
that were focused on baseline
evaluation. And then
also the development of
a statewide mentor
and coach training program through
ce
s
the work of fy 20 four's
planning year is still continuing.
But here are some of our, our of
the first year's primary
accomplishments.
So as I mentioned, teams from all
seven ed prep programs
participated in the community
of practices.
Um The Ed prep programs
collected input from their
districts and partner program
participants. As Annie
said district and
Ed Prep program, uh
partnership
is a really important
aspect of high
quality administrative
prep ep
PS have built now
to implement the many
of the features of
high-quality administrative prep
programs.
Um and we've identified
options to pilot
uh this next year for
training mentors and coaches
so that those that those
people can be well prepared in
their roles to support our
candidates.
And now in fy 25
4 of our educated
educator prep programs
um have applied to
pilot the full year residency
model and we're just in the
process of um figuring
out those awards right
now.
In addition to the technical
accomplishments,
we've also seen a lot of
progress and adaptive change
and mindset shifts that will
help set these programs up
and provide high quality residency
experience that yield
impacts and make these
investments more valuable.
So paid residency is not
designed for everyone.
Paid residencies should
actually be designed for a
select relatively
small number of quality
candidates that are
identified by both prep
program and district
who seek to move into school.
Leadership roles within New
Mexico
residencies are not provided
for candidates to observe
their mentors. They are
intentionally designed for
leaders to practice leading
and develop leadership
competencies through
authentic field based
opportunities.
And we've built a statewide
understanding about the importance
of high quality mentorship
and coaching models that
are really necessary to
provide opportunities
to practice and receive
meaningful feedback
while they develop their leadership
competencies.
For fy 25 we
are extremely grateful for
the $20 million appropriation
that supports the three
high-quality clinical practice
pathways for the next three
years. This
table shows a breakdown of how
these clinical practice funds will
be allocated.
So 2 million
similar to last year will
be going towards supporting the
implementation year for the
principal pilot.
Approximately 5.5
million for student teaching
stipends and
approximately 12.5
million for teacher
residency.
We've also used this first
year to help us set up for
success in this coming
year. So this fy
25 timeline supports
implementation programs
are already in the midst of
recruiting their
candidates and will be
site matching in July
so that candidates can actually
begin their full year residency
in August.
We are ready to pilot the
different coaching and mentoring
training options
that we that were vetted
this past year.
And we've established an
evaluation model to support
the evaluation of the pilot and
provide some valuable baseline
data.
In fy 25. We've set
the the following goals.
As I said, we're going to pilot
approximately 20
principal residencies
with candidates that plan to
become school leaders
in New Mexico. We're
gonna continue to learn and build
capacity around all
six features of effective
leadership preparation.
And we're going to evaluate the
pilot and inform program
criteria around lyen
requirements as Michael was
mentioning
and hopefully set up for an expanded
principal residency pilot in
2526.
I want to thank the legislature
for prioritizing this investment
in school leadership preparation and
assure you that we are being thoughtful
and intentional about how these funds
are utilized. This
timeline shows our long term
vision for the work.
This year we began with a focus
on capacity building and
planning. Next year,
we're going to pilot the small
cohort of principal residents
while working as Annie
mentioned to identify braided
funding and sustainability
strategies. And
from there, we hope to
utilize the evaluation
data from the implementation
pilot to expand and
fine tune accordingly.
Finally toward the close of
this three year fund. And assuming
that preparation criteria and
legislation is passed
and licensure code is updated
to reflect this
high-quality criteria.
We hope to determine a full year
residency is something
that should be provided or even
required for all of our
school
principals.
So in the 25
the 2025 legislative
session, we hope you'll consider
the following,
bringing back legislation
that includes aligning school
leadership standards to high
quality program requirements
for the preparation of Vice Principals
and Principals.
Moving school, the school
Leadership Institute from the
Higher Education Department to the
Public Education Department,
um which I can speak a little bit
more about, but it currently
falls under the um higher
education department
and we feel that we could
better um
manage it and do a lot more
with it. If it was, if it fell under the
public education department,
consider lic revision
that sets up specific
criteria for principals
and vice principals
and then also consider adding
additional licenses
or endorsements for
superintendents and district
leaders in the
future.
This final slide contains some
resources and research around
school leadership preparation that
have guided our work.
The final bullet and link
also includes a link to the Albuquerque
Chamber of Commerce uh
Leadership landscape
analysis report that really
initiated the Deans and directors
working group and that has really served
as a cornerstone for
much of this work.
So I'd like to thank you very much for
your time today and we
are happy to answer any
questions that you
have.
>> Thank you. Anything else
either you are ready for
questions,
Mr Chair, we're ready for questions,
Representative Baca if
you would please
thank you, Mr Chairman and thank
you for this
presentation.
Uh It's a very important
issue that we're tackling here
about school leadership,
district leadership.
Um
For myself, you
know, we each of us may have a date
that that sticks in our mind
where it changed our path.
For me, that date was
October 10th,
2005.
Um I was teaching fifth
grade and
the superintendent comes into my classroom
unannounced,
pulls me outside and says, if you
asked to speak with me,
basically, he told me that I
was, there was a
school in trouble and that I was being
moved to school. So on
Monday, I was the
fifth grade teacher
on Wednesday, I was an
assistant principal at a school
that was in trouble.
Goes on further at the end of the year.
By the end of the year,
both the principal and the other
principal had left. I
closed out the year
with absolutely no experience
there. So I
this is a great need that
we need to, to take a look
at in the way we're
prepared for.
Um
You, you touched on
school leadership matters.
You know, one of the reasons
when you talk to teachers, why they
leave, it's not
necessarily because of the
money. It's
actually because of the leadership
of that. Do they feel supported
by their administrator?
Do is there a culture there
that's good for both students and
staff? And I think that's an important
piece that we need to
consider. Um
Mr Chairman and I I see some
folks out there.
One of the real serious issues
that we have for
not only the
law student, school district, but
for many districts is the
recruitment and retention of
administrators.
There's not enough
folks that want
to join or
become a part of this
um
profession.
It used to be when they would apply
for a job you would have
so many different candidates and
you actually had the,
the task of screening these
applicants. Now,
you're looking to get two or
three, some
of them unwilling like I was
and they're forced into these, these
situations. And
so, uh, I
think that it's, it's an
important piece of it.
One of the areas I think
Mr Chairman that I think we need to
address as
legislatures is
the compaction issue.
As teachers salaries have
increased. And when again,
I support the salaries I
have voted
for those I have supported the
bring. But what
we've forgotten is on the top end
of it.
It's like for our
school district, our teachers
on 100 and 90 day contract
administrators on a
244. And when
you're looking at the top level teacher
to an assistant principal, you're talking about
a difference of maybe 5 to
$7000 for
an extra 50 days of work.
Why would you want to do
that?
Especially with the types
of things that,
that you have. And so,
um
the last thing Mr Chairman and I
wanted to is a statement.
It's the professional
development just because you
get the keys to the building
doesn't mean that you need
to stop growing. We have
taken huge strides
in letters training and some of these
other instructional models. But
for our,
for, you know, educators or
for our um school leaders
or administrators that stops
and I'll, I'll tell you Mr Chen,
I'll, I'll name a program because
uh it actually
one of the, one of the early programs
I had was actually Dardan
Curry. School
turnaround was a
program. And that's actually where I met my
friend, Stan rounds. We got to work
together.
Very effective. It was a
summer institute.
It was something that
folks not during the school
year, but during the summer they got to go
down and have discussions
regarding
uh data driven decision making
at lead 101. We,
we did, we did activities
where we observed
classroom teachers, OK?
We, we had a, a
film and then we sat
down and we actually observed the
teachers and we debriefed
on that. What do we say?
And then we also had tasks
like we had the difficult conversations,
we had to role play. I
guess we got to be the bad teacher.
It was used as me usually.
Um But I think those
are the types of things that I would also
like through these
programs and through these
initiatives because I think they do
make a difference.
You know, there was a time Mr
Chairman that we would not consider
putting
a
assistant principal into a
principal role until they had
three or five years worth of experience.
Now, for many of our folks, they have
six months as an assistant
principal and because
of aroad movement
or whatever they're cast into
that. So I appreciate
Mr Chairman bringing this forward,
Gwen. I think
there's a lot of work that's going to be
done here because I think
that as part
of our commitment to
education,
our investment into school
leadership and district leadership
is also a key part
of our turnaround pro schools.
Thank you, Mr Chairman.
>> Thank you, Representative Milo
Moya.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you panel for,
for that presentation.
Um I have a kind
of a somewhat along the lines
of uh Representative
Baca's because a lot
of times it is about pay. It is,
it is pretty crazy because
I always say you couldn't pay me
enough to be an administrator.
So I like, I, I couldn't
because the the amount of pressure
that they have and the things that they,
that they have to deal with on a day to day
basis. Um
and I prefer um
teenagers over adults anyway,
having to deal with them. So,
um but um
um but so I was
wondering, it
was, it was interesting to see the
successes in um in
Illinois. Do you know
the salary difference between
the two
States
>> Representative Lawyer.
Thank you for your question. I do
not know the salary difference. I
know that we had asked them if they
also struggled with compaction
and they also said that it's
an issue that they've faced
there. Um but I could
look up the exact difference and get back
to you. >> Yeah, that thank
you Mr Chair. That would be, that would be
interesting to kind of see.
Now I do one thing that
I wanted to kind of
um point
out is when I
love your 20 years
of principal improvement. Like so it,
it took time.
Um and, and that is something
that most people
don't have the patience
for edu because most
results in education, take
time if not
all. Um but people
want it now they want
something to change
immediately. Now I'm sure
they saw different growths, you said
after one year, there was certain growth
and growth and stuff like
that. But when
you, it really is a
trickle down effect. If you get a
good effective leader, then
you're gonna have happier staff,
which are gonna have happier students
and everybody is going to be able
to um
to uh to
perform to the best of their
ability. So,
so what that takes time?
That's not going to be. So
I think, I think for us
and, and for anyone that, that is
listening, we need to like
settle in for a second and,
and, and give it that time.
To be able to effect
effective come
to fruition because all
too often we expect. Oh, yeah,
we through money, we, we made a
change. We, we did a law
and, and we passed the law
and it's supposed to next year.
I don't see change. Well, no,
it's gonna take time because
you have to allow, you got to get it right
if you, if you really
want. And I, and I like your
timeline on, on,
on the hopes and, and,
you know, we may not have
an anac exact
structure for a few
years because you want
to get it right. You don't want to do it
quickly and
then have to redo it,
which you're still going to anyway because
you're, you're gonna work out bugs.
But again, um,
so I think that that's a good thing.
I think one of the important things
for me and I've
noticed, um, across
the district and, and
my district and, and others
is many times
people will move up and,
and again, following,
um, Representative
Baca's comments that
sometimes it's just a matter
of, um, I just need a
body and nobody else is
willing to do this.
So,
um, because
there is a lot of people like me, like, no,
no, not me. No, thank
you. So,
but that
they definitely
need more time in the
classroom. I, I've seen
a lot of uh
principals that
maybe have,
you know, they, they've worked their way
up and you know, 34
years in the classroom. And
now you're gonna tell me
how I can effectively
do something and,
or some of my colleagues, I'm
still, I'm still fairly new. Uh
some of my colleagues that have been in there
for 25 years
and you know, it's,
it's very hard to trust someone
knowing how to be that, that's
going to be that leader. So
definitely time in the, in the
classroom. So you can
truly understand
what uh the
or or remember what the teachers
are going through. Uh But
thank you. Thank you for your
presentation.
>> Thank you, Representative
Representative
Garrett,
>> thanks Mr Chair. Thanks for
this um
presentation. I was on a trip
and something I really learned
from going on a trip to
Chicago
um in
Chicago, they
really, really
collaborated with the
funders and the private
organizations like we
had uh Michael from Thornberg
and we had the Maddox Foundation.
What was her name?
Mida from
Maddix. So we had private funders
from both North and South, New
Mexico. We
had Annie from L AFC.
We had Sonny from LFC.
We had me as
one of the bills sponsors.
Uh Representative Boco is
another bill sponsor.
Um And then
we had um
people working in the principal
program at un
mnaps.
So it was really, and we
should have had you with us too, Phoebe.
We tried
but, but that's the thing.
It was a collaborative
process.
Um That was very
powerful
And actually in Chicago is the
private funders that
were the continuity because there's
change over in
Departments of Education
and districts and
many of the funding organizations
were kind of the
um the people that
stayed with it. So that was a
real takeaway for
me.
Um
And then what, what I'd ask,
please explain more about the
communities of
practice because
we have the Deans, the
Colleges of Education
meeting, but
talk more about the Communities
of Practice.
>> Um Mr Chair and
Representative Garratt, I'd be happy to
uh talk a little bit more about
those. Um We
had five. Actually,
we've had four out of the
five, we have one more still
happening um In
June. Um
Let's see.
Uh There was one
virtual two day, I mean,
there was one in person, two day
convening um where
everybody came together in Albuquerque
and then the rest were virtual
uh two hour meetings.
Um Actually three
hour meetings on
Fridays. Um
And so basically, it brought all
seven admin prep
programs together.
It also many of those
programs included their stakeholders.
So they brought district
representation.
Um Some,
we had um
our consultants were
facilitating the community of practice.
They usually had a focus
around specific
areas of the
of what makes high quality
preparation. Um
So we focused a lot
around the mentor and coaching
piece. Um A
lot of um work
was done around um what
authentic assignments
really look like and how
those should be evaluated.
Um We
had a lot of conversation around
backfill. Um And
how do you
release a candidate from their,
from their classroom if they're a
teacher to do a full
year residency without
um the unintended consequence
of hurting students
because there's no
teacher in that classroom. So
a lot of brainstorming
went around, how can we
use um kind of
a, a systems approach and teacher
residency? And if a
resident is moving out of a
classroom, perhaps then
that they can move
into the classroom where
a principal
resident may become uh
do their residency the
following year. So creative
approaches to that um
how we looked at research
from across the country, we had
experts from
University of Washington,
um University
of
uh Connecticut
um and a number of other models
that really came and informed how
their institutions had
moved towards these high
quality um
criteria and how they've
really what their
districts have done in terms of
backfilling and uh different
ideas. So really rich
conversations, it was
a um
AAA really worthwhile
use of time. I think that all
seven admin prep programs
felt that they
um were far
better equipped and
actually had um
made shifts and evolved
their programs to
look very different this year,
whether or not they felt ready to
implement fully year residency,
their programs had improved because
of those, those
meetings,
>> Mr Chair Representative, may I add
something? Um
I had the opportunity to sit in
on a couple of these
and I found
it really refreshing. I think so
many times, we
um as a legislator
and staff often feel frustrated
that we see money invested
and really excellent
ideas. And then
when we see the implementation,
it's not always what we hope
it will be. Um And
sometimes we don't see the outcomes we're hoping
to and it,
it was really
powerful to watch these
educator preparation
programs interact with each
other. They had school
district, um local school district
partners often on the
calls and to hear
them ask all these questions of
these kind of national experts
with a lot of expertise in the
area. And you can just
see as you listen to
them how important it
is to do all of this work
before you launch the
programs. Because
there's a lot of pieces
that are not there yet
in some of these programs.
And so we can, you know, put
the money in and require
them to do something. But if they
haven't built that capacity and
that understanding of buy in
yet, it's, it's quite clear
to me that we won't see those results.
So this really seems like it's
being done the right way to me.
Thank you very much,
>> Mr Ch, I just want to add
in, in Chicago, the
University of Illinois
Chicago program did away with
their master's degree.
It's a doctoral program.
So some people in it
who were accepted as a program
already had master's degrees
and we now getting a
doctorate degree
and then some of the colleges
around Illinois
couldn't do that.
So there was really a diversity
of, of
um
um implementation
and how they did it.
But a key point was the
money. It's like you left your
position, but
during your residency, the
same salary that you
had continued.
And that's always a
challenge, I
think.
Um And
then I have just one more
practical question for
Phoebe.
Do we still have this
system for principals who have
master's degree,
master's degrees
already? To just complete
18 credits
of educational leadership
courses to get their
administrative
license.
>> Yeah, Mr Chair Representative Garrett,
we do. Um
so and alternative
programs uh
so many different ways
that you can move into
and get that three B license
right now.
>> Um Thank you.
Yeah, and I, I would say
if you look at a 10 year
depending where you are in the state,
there has been a couple years of
progress but when
I did my administrative
program, it
was just on my prep
and then other people,
another program you got a
day and a half
and now there are some
residencies
but as, as
everybody knows, it's like,
I, I still remember
all of a sudden I had to deal
with 3/7 graders
who brought vodka and
water bottles, you
know, and it was like that was during
my prep period.
So it's, it wasn't
adequate for dealing
with the whole spectrum.
So we really need
uh I know there's some
semester residencies,
but we really need it. So
anyway, thank you.
>> Thank you. Representative
other.
We'll start with Senator Stewart and then
Senator
Lopez.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. This
is very exciting
for us to be doing this
now. We've, we've been
trying it for years,
so I, I
appreciate everyone's
involvement.
Um You know, we've
all got horror stories
about principals.
I've taught for
five years at Lowell
Elementary. In my last four
years, we had a, every
year and
the next to the last principal
was a bodybuilder.
Uh It was young, very
attractive and wore tight
shirts and flex those muscles
all the time. So
we didn't do much that
year that we just sat at
those uh uh
principal meetings. We just
stared at him flex
his muscle. He
was not very helpful.
Uh The last year
we had a principal that
slapped a parent
because she didn't like
the language she was
using. Uh so
that school had the
district administration
there all the time.
Uh Every time they came,
they said to me, please go
into administration. I
said, no, I'm
not doing
that.
So um very
challenging to
uh the, the teachers
just took that school over,
we took it over and we
ran it. Um
So um very
proud of the work of
Lowell elementary
teachers. Um It's
still one of those
struggling schools,
but it was very fun to
teach there. I won a
statewide award with a
second grade teacher. That
year, I had a K
one D level
classroom and with
his second grade. We,
we did a by schoolwide
project, a literacy
project where we turned
the, the school into a
city. We had the
kids name all
of the streets
which were the sidewalks.
And on Friday afternoon,
everybody took time
to write a letter to someone
else in the school. And then
we had little mail people run
around deliver. It was
so much fun.
So, um
but a
good principal is
much better
than relying on
teachers in their prep
periods to deal with
vodka in water
bottles. And uh
we didn't know quite
what to do with the principal
that slapped the parent.
That was very
exciting
time.
So this is a long
time coming. I'm glad we're doing
it. I did work
with the Chamber of Commerce.
Uh They wanted us
to, uh, you're
all laughing about this.
They wanted us to
immediately
um repeal
all the accreditation for all
the colleges of education
and have everyone reapply
in two years.
Um, because they
were sort of saying we don't
know how else to do
it and it, that's what they
did in, was it
Indiana
wasn't ill? Was it
Illinois? No, it was
Indiana, I think.
Yeah. Uh So,
so this is a good plan. I'm
really glad we're doing it
and this is what
we do when we have
money. We're
rich. Now, I'm
just following Senator
souls' comments.
We're not rich. So we
should be doing this. We should
be professionalizing
every aspect
of our educational
system and, and
it seems like this is the last
piece. It's not, but
it's one that we've
uh sort of ignored for a
while. I, I will
tell you that I know that the
Secretary of Education
has tried to get the
colleges of Education
even this year
to begin teaching
their teachers how to teach according
to science of how kids learn
to read uh through structured
literacy.
Senator Souls
met with some people in
New Mexico State
asked them how they're
incorporating structured
literacy. They had no
idea what he
was talking
about.
So,
um I mean, this
is serious
stuff we're talking about.
We're talking about 70%
of our students not being able to read.
That's a human rights
violation in my
mind, it's a huge
equity issue
and impacts the
Yazzie Martinez
uh uh group of
people. So
unless we've got our colleges
of education on
board teaching
us uh what we,
how we need to teach, we're
not gonna get anywhere.
So that has got to
be part of this
principal uh
program.
Um uh
So I will say
that, you know, I was part of the
International Education
study group through
NC SL.
Um And
when these other countries
that we studied, when
we said to them, where did you,
where did you get your research
done? They said to
us what that
United States has done the
best education research
of the whole world, we
just take your research and
use it. You
don't use it. But
we're going to
England and Scotland
15 years ago,
put in their
statutes that
you have to use structured
literacy to teach
students. That was 15
years ago. Think
how far
ahead we would have
been um, if
we had done that 15 years
ago. So this
is great. Thank you so
much, full steam ahead and
now that we're rich, we can pay for all of
it. Thank you, Mr
Chairman. Thank
you, Senator Senator >> Lopez.
Uh Thank you Mr
Chair and I appreciate the
presentation and
you know, thank you for your foresight.
Also, Representative
Garrett for you
and, and Representative Baca
for moving forward on a
much-needed
um
process and
journey. Should I say
I do have a question though and,
and I, I was looking through
the some of the information
that you shared with us,
but
as part of the
preparation,
um is there any
focus giving given
um towards uh
Children who have a learning
disability?
And I know those are some of the
issues and concerns that I
have um
you know, dealt with, with my, with
my families when we go to a
school in my area,
when there's some concerns
about how their child is not
receiving services.
Um You know, all of those
other important concerns,
which was also part of the
Martinez um lawsuit
against the state when we talk about
Children with learning disabilities.
So, is there any
information at least that is
shared or how
um school administrators
are, you know,
guided um
with that. And also
too, just another part of this.
Um Mr Chair is
what about issues about
diversity,
equity inclusion?
I know it's sometimes for some
people um not
so fun
um
issue to discuss,
but it's part of who we are here in the
state of New Mexico
and especially with
an incident that just happened
in Farmington.
Uh I think that just a few days
ago for graduation, I think this
is a very important issue and we
talk about administrators and
how they
deal with um
how they're trained to
work within the
community
that they are supposed to be
leaders in. So
Mr Chair, just some questions.
And do you have any
response?
>> Uh Mr Chair and
Representative, I can try
to take those questions.
So um
a lot of the
work that we did, especially
around the competencies
that need to be part of
admin prep programs
were focused around
uh equity and
there were some amazing
pre reading articles that
all of the programs would
do in preparation for the
meetings. Um
There was uh one of
the tasks during our in person
meeting centered around the development
of a um
of an authentic assessment
and how a task
that a principal might do that centers
around an equity plan for a
school and working with
their mentor, uh
principal in designing
something like that.
Um I think
that, that's one of the things
that full year, full time
residency could
address and in a
lot fuller
capacity. Um
Is that right now,
the our, our
incoming principals don't have
much preparation besides maybe
a little special education
uh law
courses and
um kind of a very broad
overview of what it means to work
with students with special needs.
And uh a full year
of full time residency would give
opportunity to have
them delve a lot deeper into
that and build a much broader
understanding.
Um I also think that
there is some room within
uh Leener and within
the requirements of ed prep
programs to build in
those specific competency
requirements that are
necessary for strong
leaders.
>> May I add one thing,
Mr Chairman and, and Senator
Lopez? Thank you for that
question.
The other thing that occurs to me is
that a year long
residency in and
of itself is not a
magic bullet.
Um I'm thinking about
Senator uh
Stewart's
story. Um
If someone were to
do a residency with
one of those that you
described, um
we, we probably wouldn't have a
lot of confidence in their
ability to lead. What
struck me one of the
things from the Chicago
experience was how
carefully those mentor
principles are selected
and the training
they receive on how
to be a mentor. And I'm
seeing some head nodding. I think
we know this intuitively. You
can be really good at what you
do and not
necessarily be great
at teaching others how to
do that thing. That
really is as a separate
set of skills. So,
coaching of
principal who will
be those mentors is
a really important component
of this. And it's something that has
been built into the community
of practice and you
know, everything from, from what you're
describing, it's not
enough to just sit
through an IEP meeting.
If you're a school principal,
you're, you're really actively
involved in those,
those issues and we know how
critically important that is. So I, I
appreciate that question.
>> And again, Thank you, Mr
Chair. It's
just,
there's, there are
concerns um
across the state of New
Mexico uh from
different school districts, right?
And it, it starts, I
think of course, with the
teaching,
what we do to
um train work
with, encourage um
you know, as, as administration,
you know, persons move up the chain of
command as I would say, Mr
Chair. Um
but ultimately,
it still comes down to that person
who's sitting in that principal
ship
uh at each school.
Um because of the
Children who are entrusted to
them, you know, and a person
with a learning disability may
not be the same as a person with
a special need who may have a
physical
um you know,
concern, right? Maybe in a
wheelchair or something. But
I, I just, I'm
hoping that that is
still
not just in passing.
Oh, this is what you're supposed to do,
but I, I do believe Mr Chair
that we still need to have some
focus on Children
who uh
because of the Aces and all the
other issues that come in
um with many
families, I mean, we all have them in
some fashion. But if you have a
learning disability
that also adds more
consternation for the
child and for the
family and if we don't have
a leader who
yes has to lead the team and
I understand about leadership,
you know, management styles and
such, but it also that person
is also the leader for the dis,
for the, the
house, not the dis well in the
district, but for the community
and the neighborhood in which they
live, you know, the, the
parents that come in and maybe
the administrator doesn't live in
that district but they're
in and they are part of that
community. So it's also
part of that uh
understanding of
the communities,
um the
diversity that's within the
community, all of the other
aspects. I mean, it, it's a hard
role for Mr Chair when
you're having to do that
leadership. But
I know I've seen in my own
small district of
when we have good leaders who come
in and who understand and are willing
to work with the community
and not come in with their bias
because they know better.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
>> Thank you. Anyone
else?
Representative
Figueroa.
>> Thank you Mr Chair.
Um And thank you for the
presentation. It's really
helpful to know how the
appropriation is being
used and to see
the foundational pieces
being laid
carefully so that
we have successful
outcomes. I'm gonna
ask about something that came
up in the first presentation
and then seem to disappear
in the later presentations.
And that's the data tracking
piece. Has that been
any part of the
community of practice
discussion?
>> Yes. So Mr chair and
Representative, I can uh do
my best to address that question.
So um
data is incredibly
important and it has been an
area that I think
um like um
Senator Stewart mentioned, I think
that we can do a lot better
with, um we're
trying to be really intentional
um with this in terms of
setting up an evaluation.
So we are working with a, an
evaluator right now
to collect some baseline data
across the state in terms
of uh
vacancies,
retention rates, um
kind of understanding the
landscape um
that will hopefully
inform kind
of what numbers look like
in the future. How many residents,
how many principal residents
um do we need every
year? Um where are they most
needed? What is the demographic
of those residents need to look
like? Um How
do we ensure they stay in New
Mexico if we put this
investment into them for at
least a period of time to really
serve our students. So,
um and then really
evaluating on,
on, on, on in an ongoing
way as to kind of show
how we're doing with um
filling those rules and um
meeting those
needs.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and thank
you Phoebe. It is going to be
critical. It's
one of the six
identified characteristics
of an effective training program,
but it's also a crucial
piece of effective policy
and for us to advocate for
future funding and
for growing this kind of training,
we're gonna need all the data
about retention
and outcomes.
So I don't want it to get lost
in the shuffle. Thank
you, Mr Chair.
>> Thank you. I've got a couple
of questions. And first Michael
when you were going and I wrote a note as
you know, how do we handle leaders coming from
out of state? And about two minutes
later, you kind of mentioned
someone how to do that.
Um And
when you first started and you were
talking about what they did in
Chicago, it
was district
led, pushing
the universities and
then it looked like the state
followed.
What we're looking at doing
is almost a flip of
that. Um
And Michael, as you, as I
look through the page on workgroup
members, it's
all the higher ed people,
we're the district people.
Um And
those partnerships it
sounded like in Chicago
were very much the
district saying this is what
we need university,
prepare them for
this. And we're now
having the university saying
this is what you're going to get is
what it
appears,
help me understand
why we saw a great model
and we're not following that
model,
>> Senator Souls. Um
Mr Chair. Thank you for
your question.
Um I will let
either of you add to this if you'd like to
because you were here before I was at
the start of this work.
Um But I
will say that I think
the districts have been involved in the
community of practice
more strongly in some
cases than in others.
Um And Albuquerque
AP S has been a great
example of, of actually
leading a lot of this work in their
district. Um
So they've, they've definitely
quite,
I think there's been a very conscious
effort to include them in the work, but
it has been an opposite
um direction we've taken
to either of you want to add
anything.
>> Go ahead. Yeah, go ahead.
And I will. >> Um Yeah,
I was to echo
what Annie was saying. I
think that there's,
there definitely has been district
involvement. I think that we
are um
looking for more partnerships.
So that's part of what we've really
been. I think
district Ed prep
partnership is something we are trying
to build. But for
teacher residency, for
um for all
preparation of educators, it
really does need to be strong
district and ed prep
partnership both have
responsibilities when it comes
to preparing
educators and school leaders.
And so
um
we're, we're trying
to braid that in more
and it will be critical in terms of
sustainability and braided funding
as well. Um I
think that there are some
Ed preps that have stronger
district partnerships than others.
And so really working
with them to show the
uh the vitals
of that and how important
that district partnership
is to their program in general
and seeking that feedback
from them and working collaboratively
in terms of what their
program is providing
so that it really does meet the needs of
the districts. But um
ideally, I think
we would want more
district partnership and
we ideas on how
to make that happen um
are what we're trying to what we're
exploring.
>> And uh
Mr Chairman, I appreciate
the question.
Chicago
is a district
of
323
130,000
students in
that sense, they
are very similar
to New Mexico in terms
of scale. So
there were, there was some conversation
about why, why are we looking at Chicago?
What can we learn and
um their
ability to do it at the at
the district level a actually
feels very similar to the way we've
approached it at the state
level. Um
The other thing and I, I go
back to something that,
um Senator Stewart a
admonished us a
couple of years ago.
That's, it's a very strong word.
Um But we're
really expecting higher
ed to change the
way that they prepare
principles. So they
needed to be at the
table. And I, I
think that was the starting
point. What we see in
the best models and this
was one of those six programs
components is the importance
of that partnership. I'm,
I'm thinking again to
Representative Baca's
story of how you
were identified on a Monday
and you're there on a
Wednesday. What, what we
really want our districts
to be much more thoughtful
about how many
principals they'll need
in a, in a given year
and
involved in the
identification process
because right now our
colleges of education
essentially take whoever
comes to them and say
great. We'll, we'll prepare
you to become a principal and,
and they could be much more thoughtful
and targeted about that. So,
um, it's,
I don't know if that exactly
answers the question, but it is
a yes, we
want those partnerships
and we're starting, you
know, with, with higher
Ed.
>> Yeah, Mr >> Chair. Just
to add a little bit after, as
I'm thinking about it. Um
If you actually look at Illinois,
they've had this great
successful district different
partnership in Chicago with
the enormous scale as
Michael pointed out, but
they don't have those same partnerships
elsewhere in the state, particularly
in rural areas. And
so we're trying to lead something at a
state level, including all
those rural areas. We've got districts
all over who aren't necessarily
in the backyard of a prep
program. So we're trying to
focus on those prep programs
to be able to reach out to
everybody.
>> Thank you. And, you know, my story
is almost is similar
to Representative
Baca's is, you know, I was
working in the College of Education
and a week later I was a middle
school principal in Silver
City area with,
I didn't even have an administrative
license then or a teaching
license. Um
Those all kind of came
afterwards. I did the whole
world upside down in education
or backwards. Um,
but, you know, learned a lot on the
job, we talked some about special
education and how to
manage IEPs
and, you know, they
had little training.
But, you know, I had a psychology
background and relied on that a whole
lot, some out with middle
schoolers, but
that was a whole different
set of stories. Uh
Senator Stewart indicated
some things that I mentioned, I think two
times already in this meeting, but with
others is I recently had
a conversation with somebody who's
going through the admin program
at New Mexico State University.
And I just said, have they
talked about Aces
and trauma informed?
Never been mentioned in any of
the coursework for that program.
They talk about structured
literacy, never
been mentioned in any of
those. Did they talk about
community schools?
Never was mentioned
at all. And those are
critical programs that we're
doing at the state legislative
level. And yet every
principal coming out of that program is
not even being exposed to
that. And I know in
Las Cruces as we're trying
to, the, the board
is trying to expand community
schools. The problem is
finding a leader who understands
community schools and
the university right there in
town is not
preparing them
to, to handle that
direct need with
their partner district.
Um That's
concerning and frustrating. And
so when I saw on here
that the main
workgroup members are
all university
people and
it's always been,
we're the ones gonna give you
principles here
type of thing rather than what
do you need. Um And
so I guess what I'm saying with all of
that is
do we need to spend more
talking with Stan
and his superintendents
about what
do they need when they are looking
for principles to
meet the demands that we're
putting on them as
legislators. Uh
What they see is the needs
of their kids. Certainly coming out of
COVID, the trauma
informed uh
instruction,
uh understanding
that the extra burdens
of mental health
issues
that don't seem to be
filtering through this
more traditional program
if that's making sense.
And so I,
I worry as I look through
this, that there's not a strong enough
hand of the districts
saying this is what
we want our
principals to be able to
do rather than
universities saying this is what
we're going to give
you.
So I'm not sure
exactly where and stand. I
hadn't talked to you ahead of time, but
certainly your principal
group ought to be driving
this as to what's needed
in the districts for training
rather than here's an
administrative license. Let's see if
we can, can make them fit into
what our district needs
are.
So that's kind of my little
soapbox. But please, anyone wants to
respond, >> always
dangerous to respond to a
soapbox senator. So,
but what I would
say is I
agree. And
the workgroup as
it is contemplated
for this summer is
meant to be much more
inclusive,
including
um, a former
superintendent who are reaching
out to, to co-chair that
workgroup who
um, is very involved with
superintendent rounds.
Um And ce s
and um,
recognizing that
licensure in
particular gets
much more in, into the
weeds and affects, um, a
broader degree of
stakeholders. So that is one
way that we're attempting to
address that this summer
and hopefully we can, we can come back
to you with more specifics. I, I
>> missed, what do you mean by licensure
is a way that gets more
in?
>> Well, I, I think this
question of
um,
the specificity of what
districts need and
want to see in, in
their principles and
um how we line that up with
the licensure process is what I
meant by that.
>> Ok. Um Yeah,
I, I'm impatient,
you know, we've been working
for a while and very much
uh representative Moya, you
know, we were chatting about it yesterday
and I recognize that changes
in education are like buying savings
bonds, you don't buy and expect full
value next, you know, next
year you gotta wait for them to
mature. But
I'm impatient
because we should have been doing
this for a long while.
Um And just want to
see a whole lot more
it being driven by the ed
practitioners rather
than the higher
ed researchers
who haven't been directly
in the schools dealing with the current
issues that we
have. Uh and
certainly special education
issues, equity issues,
uh specifics
on teaching of
reading and math
and principal have
to be informed about
all of those if they're gonna be
effective leaders
and that doesn't seem to
be much of the conversation, at
least in what's currently going on
in those programs. And
so we would love to see it driven
a lot more by the needs of our
superintendents
and our districts
rather than by
our higher education
institutions. So,
thank you all very much. And please,
if you'd like to respond, >> I just
wanted to add one more thing, Mr
Chair. So um in
the uh fy 25
applications that we've received so
far, one of the requirements
is that uh
each of the programs that is applying
for funds has outlined specific
district partnerships.
Um So um
all of those, I think
there will be four awarded
programs this year and
all have at least
identified. Um
one or
up to, I think 5 to
6 district partnerships
that they will be working exclusively
with to uh
implement the principal
residency this year.
>> May, may I just add
one more comment, Senator Sez
Mr Chairman, the
and it's the importance of a
statutory framework.
Um I, you know, Senator
Stewart, your example
about um structured
literacy is, is
really relevant. And
what struck me last
summer hearing
from the deans and directors
is that uh they
actually welcome this
kind of uh
legislative
encouragement.
Um That's euphemism
that um
that, that they need that
kind of political
cover to
affect some changes that they
would often like to make
but have difficulty
getting through their own institution.
So, so I think you
are um providing
that for them and it's important for
us to, to keep that in mind
moving forward.
>> Thank you. And just kind of, one more
comment is
again in Illinois, the legislature
was kind of the last piece when they
put in a similar thing.
What specifically
can we or what levers
do we have in this upcoming
legislative session?
Other than appropriating money to
continue the funding for the residencies?
I mean, that's very clear.
Are there more statutory
types of things that we need
to change and fix
to move this along
for a high quality
uh preparation?
Besides just funding
for the longer residencies
that I think we all agree is
important.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair
Senator Souls.
Yes, there are some things
uh you could do.
So uh HP
22 in this last
session that you all endorsed included
a lot of those, those mechanisms.
So the first thing that bill would have
done was establish
requirements for administrative
clinical experiences.
All these things we've talked about to make
sure that a year long paid
residency is effective.
Another is
um to
we, this are the community
of practice groups set out
and endorse. Actually, this is the deans
and directors groups,
uh new requirements
for licensure and preparation
programs that are aligned to
state standards and
national best
practices including
require PE D to create
a process for approving
um new and revised
programs. And it
would have also moved that school Leadership
Institute um to
try to create more capacity
around these initiatives
from HED, which
was kind of created
um I guess about a
decade ago and was part
of UN M and, and not very
well funded and then not funded at all
and is now defunct. So it would
administratively move that from
HED to pe
D as a way to kind of make
sure there's continued focus on
these issues
we haven't really discussed.
Exactly. Or it's still in
discussion, what changing
licensure would look like in terms
of different admin
administrative
licenses. So right
now superintendents,
um directors of special
education and principals,
they all get the same preparation
and training. Um And so that's
another best practice that the
legislature um and pe
D could look at is
offering different pathways
for those different
professions.
>> Thank you.
Um Anyone
else, if not? Thank
you very much, very informative.
And again, I, I think we're all
impatient, you know. And
so, and the legislative
processes we know are
slow and cumbersome,
some by design,
but
let quickly as
we can, let's move things forward
within the processes. So thank
you. We'll take a
short break while we plan for
the late next one. So
everybody's like,
yeah.
Yes.
We can get everybody back
here. I mean, with all these good
strong conversations
about education, but
we do have business, we need
to, to take care of. And
so landscape review
of middle school education,
Jessica. And this
presentation
lays the foundation for work to
follow in response to house Memorial
for charging the LES C to
study middle
schools.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. How's
the volume on this microphone?
Ok, great.
We're trying to make sure they're positioned
appropriately and whatnot.
Um So good. Yes,
still morning, Mr chairman
and members of the committee
um this morning we
are going to talk about
middle school. I
see a lot of looks on the faces
and before I get started on
that, um I do want
to acknowledge we actually have
people who are far more experts
in middle school than I am in the
audience. Um We
have middle school students themselves,
probably the most prominent
experts in middle schools.
I just want to acknowledge
um the families of Representative
Baca and also Senator Lopez
here. Um We also have
middle school principals
in the audience. So we
have and on our committee,
a lot of experience with middle
school. So everything
I share with you
um see through a lens of
humility on my end knowing
that there's a lot of voices to this
conversation. And
today we're really hoping to
kind of set the stage for
this in depth study.
Um I'm Jessica
Hathaway. As you can see on here,
I'm a senior policy analyst for
all of you leading our students success
work, which focuses
on how our kids are actually doing
in the systems with a particular
focus on middle and
high school students.
Um And that's
really fun work. So I'm
grateful to be here with you
all.
Um going back to all those
faces that I saw um
as we talk through this today
and as we begin to work on in
depth study of middle
school, I have a
charge for all of you and
really for all of us as an
education community. And
it's what if we
viewed these middle school
years as ones for
transformation and
opportunity. What
if we viewed these as years to deeply
engage in shifting outcomes
for our students,
middle school? Given its
really unique confluence of
factors genuinely
offers just that
to all of us.
These don't have to be the
years that are viewed as just the
ones to kind of get through,
right? We even tell kids that
sometimes you just got to get through these
few years and then you're on to the next
thing you're gonna find your
interests
they could be leveraged
instead for changing
trajectories for New Mexico's
Youth by offering a time for
deep learning exploration
and reinforcement of strong
academic foundations
that we are beginning to see in
elementary schools across the
entire state.
But I do say all of this with
recognition that that's an easy
thing to say and a very
hard task to actually
do. Um
as it currently stands,
middle school is a really
difficult time for a
lot of New Mexico's young
people, um
people in classrooms this
morning right now in
schools across the state of New Mexico
are struggling.
Um We've heard just this
week about academic
declines that begin to emerge in
middle school.
We've heard about attendance
challenges that begin to
also emerge that lack
of engagement piece.
Um We've also heard
about the fact that
students ages 10 to 14
actually experience some of the highest
suicide rates, right? This
is an actual serious conversation.
So even though I'm charging us with
viewing it as a moment for
opportunity, um
it will take really intentional
focus and a lot of genuine
change to shift those
structures around
us.
Um As a committee, you
know that we've worked deeply on high
school in recent years. So during
this interim, we're continuing
that work um by
shifting down to middle
school. And as many
of you also know, um this work
is also in response to
memorial carried by
Representative Garrett during the
legislative session. Um
somehow just a few short months
ago, um in
this memorial, Representative
Garrett asked the LES C to
take on this subject by
convening a wide-ranging
working group, conducting
an in-depth study and
reporting on our findings to the
committee by the end of this
year. So
today's hearing is gonna lay the groundwork
for this again. It's very
foundational. Um
I have some initial data on New
Mexico to share with you all.
I will cover the national trends
and history on middle school that are
important to frame this
work. And then I'll close
by presenting a plan for the
study to all of you.
We offer information
today, but equally as
important. Um We're actually
holding this landscape review early
because we want to make sure that we hear
your concerns, your feedback
and your insights on
what ultimately you
all will need out of this
work so that we can return to
you with responsive and
robust findings that allow
you to consider how the L
LES C and the broader
legislature can
support our middle school
students.
All right. So with that,
um we will be working just from a
brief no slides today. So
you can turn to Tab
13 in your
binders and we'll
get started on page one of
the brief
here.
So as you'll see um
under the heading, defining middle
school, which is about two thirds of the
way down on the page.
Um in the context of
education in the United States
middle school most often
refers to grade six through
eight. Well, this is
seemingly straightforward
um guidance from the Association
for middle level Education, which
is really the only national
organization focused solely
on middle school years,
actually recommends that we
think about middle school education
as any
educational environment
that has been planned and organized
to address the developmental and
cultural needs of students,
ages 10 to
14 and sometimes up to age
15,
this may sound like a really
minor distinction, but it
actually helps us to realize that
serving these students is more
about developmental
appropriateness. And by
focusing on ages, we
realize that we actually see these
middle level students down
to grade five and even up
to grade nine as well as those
typical middle school years of
grade 67 and
eight. So as we
discuss this today, and as we work
on this again, we're really thinking
about using that national
recommendation about
age defining that
rather than specific grades
because these students are in a lot
of settings. Um As we'll share
with you soon,
I'm turning to page two
of your brief.
We're gonna take a step back and this
page covers just a couple of
items. Um The first
again, is a foundational piece is
that distinction between middle
school and junior high.
And then also what our new Mexico
State law contains or
doesn't about
middle school. And let's start first
with that distinction. So
at their inception, which
really took off in the 19 sixties
and we'll come back to in a moment.
Um Middle schools aimed to
establish distinct educational
philosophies compared with
junior high schools,
junior high schools themselves had
emerged in the first half of the
20th century as
a way to respond to a growing
student population during the
secondary school movement.
In short, we just didn't
always have middle and high
school in this country. But
in the early 19 hundreds, as this
became much more widespread
and schools themselves weren't
large enough for the growing student
population. Um
Really pragmatic decisions
about segmenting grades were
made honestly to
simply have space and buildings
and that's how we came up with
junior high schools.
But functionally that meant that
junior high schools were pretty
much identical to high schools,
just slightly younger
students in the building. There
was nothing special about the
way that they were operated
or designed to actually
reflect the needs of those
younger students who just moved them
to different buildings
as we approach the 19 sixties.
However, um new research
came out that showed that
there are distinct developmental
stages and corresponding
educational needs for
those stages. And this led
to a national middle school
movement um
we could spend a lot of time on the
middle school movement itself.
But the takeaway is that as grades
began to shift, approaching.
Um sorry, excuse me, approaches
to educating students also
began to shift. We just started
to know more about what was
actually happening.
At the time, the middle school movement
really meant middle schools were designed
to focus more on
relationships and
embraced principles such as
interdisciplinary instruction,
team, teaching
advisory periods and
flexible scheduling, for example,
block periods to
be more responsive to youth
needs. And if you've
worked in middle schools,
that may sound really familiar
because that's what research
has shown for a very long
time, um worked
for middle school students and
continues to work.
Um However, that's again, much
harder to put into practice than
it is to say we should
do
in today's world. Um The
distinction between a junior high
and a middle school is a lot more
arbitrary. It's really
kind of just a name
change and the terms are typically
interchangeable. New
Mexico does still
have some schools though that are
labeled junior high schools,
nine of them across the
state. And so they
um are called junior highs. They
generally tend to function the
same and be grade six through eight.
But we still wanted to make sure that
we defined those terms for
you all.
Uh moving now to the bottom of
page two of your
brief, you should also
know that New Mexico state law does
not formally define
middle school
that said the term is very
widely used. It's recognized
in both state law and administrative
rule and the broader definition
of public school. And the public school
code does recognize
middle school pointing to the fact
that it's not completely
unrecognized.
But technically, it does lack
a formal definition
at the very bottom of page
two. Just for your reference. I have
included what state law defines
a junior high school as
informally again in state
law, these are schools that serve
grades seven through nine or grades
seven through
eight.
Ok, turning now to page
three. This
page contains some data on
New Mexico's school structures
that we're going to go over
as you can see at the top of the page
um National research generally
finds the schools serving
middle school age students
falls into one of three main
or what we're calling typical
categories. Um
These generally tend to be one
A K through eight school.
So kindergarten through eighth grade,
um A school that's for grade
six and eight or a
school that's just for grade seven
and eight. Those are the most prominent
or again, quote unquote typical
structures that we
see.
However, if we use the national
recommendation about defining middle
schools more around age and
corresponding developmental
needs, um as well
as the typical grades of 67
and eight, data actually
shows that in New Mexico, we have
middle school students
showing up in a lot of
school models that are not strictly
one of those typical models. So
the first
um,
graphic for you to look at
here pulls those typical
models and you can see
of the ones that are falling
into one of those structures.
The, the most common
structure is that grade six through
eight school. We have 100 and 15
of those in New Mexico,
but we also have 55
K 8 or pre K through
eight schools and we have
28 schools that serve just
grades 28.
The bottom table is
included to show some of that
nuance though, right? So this
is a table that I pulled
together for you all to see
where some other middle school grades
lie even if they're not technically
in a middle school. So for
example, we have
100 and three schools that are K
through six schools. And if we
use that national recommendation
of those students, potentially
being in grades five and
six,
there's a segment of students
who have developmental needs
related to middle school
that are not in a middle school.
Similarly, we have 26
K through 12 or pre K
through 12 schools. Again,
very different developmental
needs and potentially
even the same school
building.
So by showing you this page, I'm
simply elevating the
nuance in the data
and how widespread
the findings of this work may
need to be even if they're not
about those 67
and eight schools that we
generally tend to think
of. Uh
moving now to page four of your
brief. Um I'll round
out that section by letting you all
know that we plan to review
geographic demographic
and structural trends associated
with each of those different types of
models to take a look at the student
outcomes that are actually occurring
in those spaces.
Um National research
is not clear about what type,
for example, A K through eight
school versus a grade
six through eight school that works
best for students.
So we plan to actually pull new
Mexico specific data to
see if we find any indicators
about best practices and
school models and see what we find
here.
Um But one thing that we do
know that is very clear in
research is that transition
points, for example, moving
from elementary school to middle
school or middle to high school or
even between schools
is very impactful for
students. So we'll want to take a look
at how middle school models factor
into easing those
transitions or potentially
creating challenges with those
transitions.
The rest of page four is
dedicated to
the why on this
topic. Um Why
we care about studying middle school
essentially? And that goes back to some of
my opening remarks.
But um as we've
worked on secondary school redesign
the last few years,
we have found that concerning
outcomes actually emerge
in middle school, for
example, while chronic absence
is actually high in the earliest
grades and then later grades, it's kind
of a U shaped curve or I've
heard it called the Nike swoosh
curve.
Um We
see that it begins
to rise about that middle
school mark.
Similarly, school
disengagement begins to emerge
in middle school. So by eighth grade,
45% of students
say that they're engaged
even though they started sixth
grade with 67%
of them saying that they're engaged in
school. So there is an
engagement component that's happening.
We're losing the interest of
students in the middle school
setting.
Similarly, we see
academic achievement concerns
in middle school, particularly in
mathematics which begins a
steady downward
fall in middle school, unfortunately,
that persists into high
school. Um and
that you can see in that bottom
chart on your page
here.
So what this is showing you is
that in grade 5
34% of
our students
are showing proficiency
in math, which again is
still not as many as
we would like. But if we
took this table, I think there's
nine of you here right
now. That means
you all are proficient. But
by eighth grade we've
got more like
1.6
of you are proficient.
Right.
Yes.
Yes. Very good.
Um, but we
would like to view again, this
is a, this is a moment for intervention.
This is a moment to really kind of
bring that growth that we are
seeing back on track
so that students can enter
high school more
prepared
um by serving
students and their educators
in these middle grades in a better
way. Again, we hope to
disrupt that downward trajectory
and capitalize on the progress that
we are seeing
um recognition
again that this will not be
easy. We've been attempting to
restructure middle schools in
the United States for
60 years. Um
So just know that, but
it is worthwhile. This is
still incredibly worthwhile. These
don't have to be forgotten grades.
These can actually be
moments where students find
passion and interest and
really connect with adults to get
on their way towards their
development.
Uh We'll move to page five
and this is kind of getting into the final
part of our presentation,
I'm going to cover what's happening
with young adolescent
development and
what research points to as
effective middle school redesign
and then we'll close with a look
at our research plan and the rest of the
time will be for you all to offer
feedback. So
again, if you'll turn to page five of your
brief, I've included
here. Um a
very, very
short summary of what's happening
developmentally. Um For young
adolescents, there
are entire textbooks
about every single one of these
headers. Um So I
share this cautiously
um and also in recognition
that we are always
learning about what's happening
developmentally and that
is one perspect the viewing
development, but there are constraints
to it. So with
all of that caution, the domains
that we generally see
development in our physical
development, cognitive
development, social
emotional development,
and psychological
development. And let's start
with psychological development.
It's your first um
item here with the talic
size and bold
header.
Now with middle schoolers,
this is the area that we're all
probably quite familiar with
in those years, between ages 10 and
15 kids change
a lot. Um They
undergo really rapid physical
growth, usually begin
to go through puberty and the resulting
development of both primary and
secondary sex characteristics.
They also less visibly though
experience neural changes
in their brains, we have
researched that shows us that
only second to
the early early childhood
development is
adolescence in terms of how
much neural pruning is actually
happening. Um It's
extreme and again,
offers a point for
intervention for that same exact
reason. But in their
brains, um we
see changes particularly in
their frontal cortex, the
cerebellum and the
amygdala.
What I'm about to say is an
oversimplification but related
to those brain changes, the frontal
cortex is responsible for
decision making, planning
judgment, the
cerebellum for coordination,
memory attention
and the amygdala for emotional
regulation, take
all of that together and you can
easily see how the biological
changes at this age lead to pretty
significant physical
development.
On that note, all of these changes
though precede muscular
development. So things like
growing pains are
not actually a myth. They can actually
be felt and affect physically
how students feel and what
they physically need in classrooms.
For example, they still need recess,
they still need time to move
because of those changes
that are happening.
Um They may also though struggle
with physical coordination because
of that lack of muscular
development
on the cognitive front. Our second
area will talk about.
Um this is an area of growth
that research shows is equally
as intense even though it may not
be as visible or obvious.
But um there is
a large spectrum of cognitive
growth and change happening
in ages 10 through 15. But
generally speaking,
um students,
young people are transitioning from
concrete to abstract
thinking. They're also
curious, they're
eager to learn, they start to
have a lot of interest and they
begin to develop personal
preferences even if
those preferences may shift
often. Um
because of these changes, they're
also developing critical thinking
skills, meta cognition.
And they're forming really complex
impressions of themselves
and the world around
them in
educational environments. Because
of all of that, they generally prefer
active learning and peer
interactions
and behaviorally, they may
be really sensitive to social
interactions and
relationships
because they're beginning to
reason, they may
also become more
argumentative and as
a surprise to no 1
may challenge adult
directives more
frequently.
That is though typical
development, that is actually
something that we want to see
in our youth. And so this is not
them just being
argumentative for the sake of it.
I think the more we
recognize this is part of
development is actually
part of designing really responsive
school environments.
At this age, young people also
have the ability to develop
personal goals and think about
the future and they do quite
often. So
again, ages 10 to 15
is a really big developmental
spectrum. But we start
to see here why they need
meaning in what they're
learning, they're already
thinking about their future lives.
And so the more we can connect to meaning,
making, the more we're being
developmentally
responsive.
The third area of development,
social emotional development,
um This really refers to
how people interact with individuals
and groups as well as regulate their
own emotions. But research shows
at this age, youth
really seek belonging
and they're deeply sensitive
to status and group norms.
So research shows again
that they're
aware of social identities, who
they and their peers are in
relation to one another. But
also society more
broadly, the
social emotional domain of dev
of development is
especially important in understanding
some of the more negative
associations and memories that
we hold with middle school
around very real
behavior such as bullying,
social dynamics and
peer relationships.
If schools are not designed
to be responsive with this domain
in mind, they can
and unfortunately do
often turn negative for
youth. Also
in this area,
we can't ignore social
media. Um
in this social media area
that we're in, we have a really
inherent dilemma.
Youth use social
media to connect
and feel connection, but they're
also really vulnerable
to its negative impact. So
one of our core questions is how
might we deal with a force that
offers both connection
but that we are increasingly finding
can also deeply harm
young people.
And finally, um we
have psychological development and
this domain is categorized by
emerging identity formation
and an increased desire
for independence, even
though they also still need
like um belonging
connection both
to their family
system, but also to
peers.
As young adolescents, bodies,
brains, cognition and emotions
are all maturing. We see
young people really start to have a sense
of who they are. Um
friendships are important and
so too is their self esteem
which again can be easily
impacted at this age.
And we want to recognize that
again, that's not just students
being sensitive, it's actually
important that they have respectful
relationships with adults because
their self esteem is
developing.
So what do we do about
all of this in an
educational setting?
Um Starting on page
six, I offered
to you a framework of 18
characteristics of effective
middle schools that comes
from the association for
middle level education.
If anyone wants to borrow this fun
book, this is the whole
book and this is the summary on your
page um
on this.
But this framework is developed
in response to those developmental
domains that we just talked
about. Again, recognizing their
limitations, but also
recognizing their validity.
Um And it focuses on culture
and community curriculum,
instruction, and assessment and
leadership and organization
also on page six
and continuing to page
seven. We
did a literature review
of all of the things that
we've learned in the past few decades
on middle school and
summarize this into a common
set of six key features
that support youth.
So again, starting towards the bottom
of page 61
of the first key features that shows
up a lot in research is
developmental responsiveness
by designing middle schools around
adolescent development.
Essentially, you can sum
that one up by saying it's recognizing
all of the information just shared,
right? These places
actually have to be designed to be
responsive for students to
succeed.
The second practice that
we see in research is
interdisciplinary instruction
and team teaching.
So um
middle school students really benefit
from the integration of content
across subject areas
because they're developing those critical
thinking skills and it provides
more engagement
to make interdisciplinary
instruction happen though.
Um Team teaching is deeply
related to that and it's
often a feature of successful
middle schools as a way to foster
that instruction, but
also through team
teaching to provide for things
like common planning time and
increase the opportunities for
educators to have
the ability to collaboratively
support students and increase
those adult connections with
them.
The third key feature is advisory
programs and personalized
support. We've known
for a really long time
that throwing uh
students in fifth grade who
are with the same teacher all day into
an environment where they may be going to
six or seven classes,
decreases the amount of
connection that they feel. And so these
advisory periods have been shown
for a really long time to be a way
to offer a common
person that they know they
can go to um throughout
the maybe every day.
Um I've heard this week
the idea of advisories
potentially being offered twice a day
as a way to increase
that connection,
but also the personalized support
that comes from things like academic
and school counseling is
another way for them to
develop strong relationships
with adults in the school
system.
The fourth feature is flexible
scheduling and really engaged
learning experiences.
And this is related to that
idea of how long
is the class period? Um
Developmentally it may take them
longer to settle into the classroom
and to need some time. And so, if
we think about things like block
schedules, longer class
periods or other creative
models, we're increasing
their likelihood to actually
engage in more of an in-depth
exploration of topics and have
the time to do.
So.
The fifth um key feature
that shows up is really positive
school climates.
And so, um
with positive school
environments that we
actually see a prioritization of
safety, inclusivity,
caring, relationships,
equity, meaningful student
engagement, reduced bullying and
respect. Those are not
nice to have for young
adolescents. Those are actually really
vital for positive academic
and social outcomes for
them. And then
the final feature is engaging
extracurricular activities and
career exploration. So
again, think of the cognitive
changes, um they are
beginning to explore their
interests and so
the more we can offer them opportunities
to do so via
extracurriculars.
Um but also just exposing
them to what their futures could
look like through career exploration.
I know that sounds very early.
Um But that's actually been
shown to foster student engagement,
a sense of purpose and to bolster
their, their identity of who they
are um by
using this body of research as
well as other frames. Um We
hope that our work group
will be able to kind of again,
use this foundational
document. The
very final thing is this
attachment, the last
page of your brief. It
has a one on the bottom
because it's a new attachment
and this is our research plan.
So it's a draft,
it's um a reiteration
of the work plan that was
presented by our director
um earlier this week. But
I'll point you especially to
our anticipated membership
and our key questions
for inquiry
with that, I will turn
the time over to you all to make
sure that we get your feedback and answer
any questions again on what you
all need. Um by the end
of this work to really have
what you need to make decisions.
Thank you. >> Thank you,
Jessica. Um
questions
representative bucket. You're always
great at getting right on the
list. I so appreciate you getting this
started. So we don't have those
long pregnant pauses waiting
for somebody else to raise their hand.
>> Well, thank you, Mr Chairman and, and
thank you Jessica for that
is um
as I it's been communicated
about the importance that
we take a look at
this and,
and not only take a look and study
it but also
appropriately support
it through whether it be
legislation or policy or
funding because
um as
we've said before, our high
schools are the,
you know, they get blamed
for the low graduation rates
for the low math
scores, you know, for
all of these types of issues.
But if we look at it,
this area that you've addressed
out here is where that has its
roots. So I,
I appreciate very
much um
the group and
uh director Perre ornament
taking a look at this
um Mr Chairman. So
you brought up parent
participation. So you, you've
actually done some studying
and some reading.
Can you tell
me
about the, your initial
thoughts on parent participation?
Because I can tell you like, and
when they're in kindergarten, we
used to have the boohoo breakfast
for the parents and the parents. It was a
boohoo because the parents are crying as they
dropped off their kids
in 7th and 8th grade, they're throwing them out
the car, right? They're like, let's just
go. So can
you Jessica just very briefly
based upon your initial
talk about the parent
participation?
>> That is great. I will
be confused when I go back to my
notes and see um Boohoo breakfast
and Mr Chairman Representative
Paca. Um
So we intend to
convene a working group on
this and that could certainly be a
place for a parental
engagement.
Um Additionally, I
think the the
knowledge building among
all adults interacting with
youth is probably another avenue
for that. Um
But I see that working group potentially
as a a place to
offer that parental engagement
around what is needed.
>> And thank you Mr Chairman. And
then as I
said before, the, the thoughtfulness
that went into this kind of work
plan is, is, is in my, is
very impressive. Um
When we talk about where our students
have the greatest social emotional
needs, uh
What we do is we take them from
uh K six in elementary
where they have one teacher that's
knows these guys can interact with
them and also they're
being asked to, you know,
transition between
seven classes.
And I think that's really a challenge
and I think it's a challenge, not only
for the kids
or students, but also for
the teachers. How do these middle
school teachers, how are
they able to connect with the student
to be able to
identify
not just their academic needs,
but also their social emotional
needs. As we said before, this
is a very critical age. And
so um
in your initial work,
when we looked at the different
grades as far as like the K
A, because I was like, well, it'd be better
if we just kept them all together
and then we didn't have that. So
any thoughts on
the actual
design or movements of students,
it really would seem to me, you know,
I know that it's been practices.
Um
Representative Mial Moya
said we
talked about having like pods
like four classes that would rotate
among their specials. We
do that for a couple of years and then we get away from
it and then
because it's for these and I think
that's, that's really
something we need to look at. So please,
Jessica, if you will talk
about if there's any change
in not
just
academics, academics
are we want that but
also for the other types of
you know, concerning
behaviors,
you know, stuff that we talked about
on on
Wednesday.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman
Representative Boca. So
one of the priority
items for us is to
look at those different models
and see what's happening in New Mexico
Schools because national
research does not elevate
one particular model over
another, but does
show that transitions are
incredibly hard. And so
one of the items that we'd like to
do um is actually
take a look at promising structures
that we know exist. For example, we
visited that Clovis sixth grade
academy, it's a potential
model, right? There are some other
options, but we would
like to actually see
what's happening here and
see where some
models may be producing different
outcomes for
students related to academics,
but also social emotional well
being and other components
of those outcomes.
Um to see what we
find, I think right now, there's
not consensus nationally.
So we're going to fill that gap
with what's happening here
um And see what we find
around if there
should be recommendations for particular
models.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman and thank you
Jessica. One of the other things that you hit
on and I think it's important is
and I'm looking out at uh
Superintendent Statis,
OK. We talk
about activities when we
talk about in this budget crisis
right here. We're talking about
what are some of the first things that they
say we're gonna cut back
on
activities or programs
or athletics? And I think
that's, that's
a, a critical part about
these middle schools
are they offer? I don't care if a kid
is in band, in choir,
in drama and sports
and whatever that is.
But I was
one of those kids that if it
wasn't, that I had to be there
to get my, that's what we used to carry
on an eligibility slip. I'd have to
carry it on each week
to make sure I was eligible. If I didn't
have to do that,
I would have been one, not a
bad kid, but I
would have been one of those disengaged
kids. And I think
that, you know, taking a look
at that, what is there
any as far as
look at what
middle schools that have been
more successful? What types of
activities, what types
of programs do
they
um
provide that helps them
to be more effective for the well
rounded
student?
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman Representative
Baca. Um It's
a really core
question for us to figure out.
So we do have we just got access
to actually this great um kind
of course uh set
of data to see what's being offered
in various schools. So we'll plan to
analyze that and see what courses
are being offered. But part of our
charge is to also
gather a little bit more
information. There's not to
my knowledge, a systematic
review of like what
different electives,
for example, or extracurriculars
are available and we know that there
are major gaps across the
state in terms of where
those are available.
So, um part
of our study, we take a look
at what's available where there are
gaps and where we may be
able to bolster
um activities for students
where we see schools where they
don't have them. Um
So definitely
on our to do list and I've, I've
noted that um from you.
Thank you >> and thank you, Mr Chairman.
Thank you, Jessica. The one thing of that, I'll tell
you that I sit on the finance,
like with my colleague, Representative
Garrett and others,
we have departments that have
grown by
30% over the last year.
We have supported, you
know, and, and had a huge investment
here and as Senator
Soul brought up the other day
is we're saving this money and
we're not till 2050
we heard this, this outlook.
We have a need right now.
And I, I really do think that as
a legislature,
we, we need to fund teachers,
we need to fund schools, but we also
need to find activities and
programs that are gonna be
that hook
for our, for our students
and we have to provide it. I, I hate
to see these clubs
and these teams having bake sales
to buy uniforms and for
travel. And we have
these other things that are basically,
they don't know how to spend the money. We're talking
about reversions all the time.
So I think that along
with the funding of public
schools, we also
need to take a look at how do we
fund these
other activities
um to keep
kids engaged. And finally,
Mr Turner, my final point is
I'm glad you guys are looking at
CTE
uh
the fact is it's, you
know, we need to at a
very young age to
understand, especially for our
kids that are in poverty that have had
these things that
there is opportunity
for them to
actually make
a change. You know, we, we
had this, if we start looking at clear
uh career
exploration, if
we start taking their interest, you
know, the, the path that not
every student
is gonna go to college,
but I guarantee you that these
plumbers, the electricians,
these folks are making
a lot more money than I am
as an educator.
So I think that we
need to not only discourage
that, but we need to encourage it and support
it with funding
to make sure that our students
have that opportunity that they
fit in and guess what? They're getting
educated for their career and it's not
just the kids are going to college that
we're being successful with.
So Jessica, I
appreciate that. Um
Mr Chairman, thank you and
committee uh director
Pere Warman. Thank you for putting this on
the agenda.
>> Thank you, Representative
Milla.
You're sorry,
have a good, >> thank
you. Um Thank
you, Mr Chair. Thank you, Jessica.
Um I'm so
glad that we're getting into this
because um
this is a, this is
a huge
undertaking, like just what you,
what the information that you
gave us already. They're
going through so
much in that
short amount of time
in their life that
they don't even know what to do with themselves,
more or less. Sometimes the adults
around them don't know what to do with them.
So, um now
um you gave us the
difference in, in New
Mexico. Yeah, New
Mexico schools. Uh some of
us like Valencia County, we 7th and
8th for middle school.
Uh Many are um
6th, 7th and 8th.
Do we know if there's a
difference in
um performance
of those schools with the different um
age
groups?
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman
Representative.
Um We don't
know yet, but that is
one of the first, we're gonna connect
these two data sets. So I
pulled the different types
of schools where we're seeing those
middle grade level, again
ages 10 to 1415
students. And
um it's on my to do list right
away to actually see
because again, there's not consensus
nationally but if we
can find what's happening here,
we think that's a core piece of knowledge
that you all need.
>> Yeah. Um yeah, thank you Mr
Chair. Um yeah, because
even for me from our, our
science department, like our
standards, our middle
school standards start at sixth grade,
but our middle school is not
in sixth grade. So,
and uh so it's, it's
uh it's up to elementary
teachers which a lot of them are very
afraid, especially science, they're,
they're afraid of science um
or they use, oh, we
read about science, that's our science
part, you know. Um
you know, and, and so
uh but those are,
that's kind of where they
come at a deficit for our
specific type
of um
of a study is,
is that when they get to
us, it's they, they didn't get
a lot because you have to cram a lot in
two years and they're going
through so much in those two years.
How much of it do they retain?
Um So, so that's
uh that I would love to, to kind
of figure or get
some information on that. Now,
um you mentioned
that they need to move
still. Um
And uh you know, I think
right now would require one
year of pe is there
possibly two
years, both years because
they do need to move
or some type of
other thing because believe
me, I taught pe
for five years. So we definitely know
all the studies of your
brain. Yeah,
physical activity makes
you smarter technically
because it does activate your brain, your
brain. Um and they have
a lot of energy that
they need to expend. So
should we be looking at
requiring them to move or
giving them more time to
move um
in that process? Because I truly
believe that
middle school, like I
think you mentioned in, in your
um in your, in your
presentation that we
kinda go from
one setting for
what, seven years? Same
thing, you know, you're with the same
teacher and then poof
the next six years, it's all the
same. This, I think
middle school, I think we need to start thinking
differently on this should be
transitioning
from one to the other.
Not so much
a quick 11 to
the next. Um
The funny thing that
I, I um
I realized because I,
for the last several years
I've uh hosted
and in fact, I have one now
um exchange
students and I think
um most of
them, if not all of them
came
here,
their uh international
schools, the teachers
move, the students
don't.
Um So, and,
and, and so it was, it's
a huge undertaking for
them when they get here that
oh my gosh, I gotta walk across
this entire campus and
and it's huge and that
could be a lot
of their transition. Where
could we look at models
where at least for the core
classes, um, they are with
the same students, they have
that same comforter and, and
the teachers move rather
than, um, the,
the students move because
sometimes you lose them during
that transition,
um, because
they don't know what to do themselves. I, I
believe me, I, I,
um, coached, uh,
when the last
few seasons
that I coached, it was middle
school boys basketball. So it was
seventh grade. So I had the
privilege of teaching them how to
play together.
Um, and, yeah,
for, for three years
they played against each
other and
I had to teach them how to play as
one and I loved it. I
loved it because to teach them how
to, how to move as a unit. That's
huge. Um,
and, uh, and so you,
but I noticed
I had 40 boys that went out
for a 15 person
team and it was very
difficult. Um, although my
son still cries because I ended up cutting
him too.
But,
but, uh, but so
it was, you, you had to be
picky, you had to find the
right people
to, to mesh with that
team. Um,
unfortunately because
there wasn't anything for,
for them to do.
We lost a lot of those kiddos
and, and, and, and, and what
sucks is that there's so many
of them that stopped
really? Caring about other
things because they could, they
didn't have that focus or that,
that something to do.
And so kind of along the lines
of, uh, representative baca
that programs,
um, not everybody does sports.
And if they can't do this sport, why
can't they do something else? Is
there other things because
their physical and social,
emotional needs
need movement,
they need something.
Um, I
do like
the fact, I think you, you made
the a comment.
Um They're already thinking
about their lives
and all too often. I
think we start, all
of our focus is their graduation
plan is, is starts their
freshman year,
but I would like for us
to start it, you know,
sixth grade. What,
what are they wanting to do? So by
the time they get to their freshman
year, they have a clear
focus and a purpose
because we're always talking about
at attendance and,
and everything else and the more
that they buy into their
education that they're
not just here because they have
to
um or because,
uh you know, the law makes them,
this is, I have an end
result and, and then
we'll get more of them trying to
actually produce that, but we should
capture that earlier
instead of waiting until
longer um later
on in their years because
if they're already starting to think about
it, that's when you get them
on that path. So
I think more and more we need to
start looking at,
at the younger grades in
order to, to
catch their focus.
Thank you.
>> Thank you, Representative Senator
Lopez.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
And this is a fun
topic.
I, uh, I
am currently living through middle
school
and I know she said that she didn't want
to say anything but she said it's
painful.
Right? Or am I correct? Ish.
Ok.
So now it's been recorded,
sweetheart.
Um,
I, I am so glad
and if I may ask who is the
sponsor of the
memorial?
Ah, thank
you.
I'm sorry, we didn't have a
mirror in the Senate,
but thank you for doing this.
The, um,
I, and, and all of us as parents
have lived through middle school or
junior high,
um,
with my son who has a learning
disability, middle school
was painful.
Um, and with all the issues
that, you know, that it's listed here and
everything else that we know of,
um, if you have a learning
disability and you don't fit
in, right. There's all those
other social issues
that come up
and when we talk about activities
for Children, if you
have a learning disability
or have another
concern issue
that comes up, you're not included
anyway.
And when we talk about a lot of the
issues that are affecting
juveniles, if
we go back to the data, I
would still say Mr Chair that
many of them have a learning disability
or some other
issue and
they are excluded because they
don't fit in already
and we do that as adults,
right? It's just what we
do.
So I would hope that this group would
also look into it, not just
the, the mainstream, but
also what do we do with the outliers,
those who have
um quote unquote, not
the, the mainstream.
I don't know how else to explain it at this
point.
Um
And then also too, when you're
gifted on the other
extreme, too, you know,
you're not quote unquote in the mainstream,
either those are the outliers.
So making sure to see also as
part of this discussion, I would hope
that the group would also look into
those who are gifted because they
too are another outlier
because they don't fit in the
mainstream.
And Mr Chair, as you know, over
the years, we've cut back on
activities for middle school, junior
high we have
because of budget or whatever else
may be.
And for those who have an
opportunity
um for their Children to
participate in
extracurricular, it's
expensive,
right? Um
Volleyball here, this was
$600 for a
volleyball participation. This
year, many families
don't have that money
and I'm not just talking
Albuquerque, but I'm looking even
rural New Mexico. So I'm hoping
that the focus on this is not
just the Rio Grande
Corridor, but rural
communities in
middle schools where they don't have
as much activity
opportunities. Or
on the other hand, there may other, may
be other cultural activities
that can be engaging and how
the relationship can go
because it's not a one size fit
all.
Um One thing I wanted to share
Mr Chair and this is something else.
Part of this
consideration
is um
I was used to in, in
elementary school
um having parent
teacher conferences. So
you have a chance to go sit with the the
teacher, uh student
comes along. We all have a
conversation
in middle school. It doesn't
happen
there is no
engagement
and with me
trying to make contact after the
first report comes
out, it
was kind of like why?
And this is coming from the teachers.
Why do you want to
meet?
Well, I'm an engaged parent.
They didn't know I was
Senator.
I just, I'm a parent who wants
to meet with you, but we don't have
time. Can we do it over a phone
call? No,
I'd like to meet with you after
school. Well, we don't have time after
school. So,
I mean that there's, I think also
part of this engagement,
right that we have to look
at. Um, and
I've talked to other parents too.
We're all kind of in the same boat.
There's no opportunity for us to
talk with the teacher and do a one
on one with the student to
develop a relationship
and everything we do is about
relationships, especially as we're
talking about cognitive
change and everything else.
Um, I think
middle school is, is part of
that, that area
where we plant the seeds
for our young people.
Ok. Um, so
I would hope that this group
begins to also look as to how
we do engagement of parents
and not say this
is middle school. We don't do it this
way. Well,
I think that needs, it's, to me,
I think a link
that also helps with parent
or guardian, whoever it may
be and the child
and the teacher in the system
that has. I think that's something
that really needs to be. And I, it's
not just the one school I'm talking
about it, it's
system wide
and last Mr chair, I
would hope that
and I didn't see it listed, but
that maybe we would actually ask some
of the students
to participate and tell
us because they're smart, they're
intelligent. They live on these
things and they know and
understand quite a bit
about what can work and what
can't. And I think
we need to listen to them because they're
the customer.
So I'm, I'm anxious to see
where and what else can come up to
this. But I still think
um
it's not the mainstream
of looking at the Rio Grande Corridor
because we have our population.
But looking at rural New
Mexico also because
I know there are, there's some things
I think maybe we could learn from them
too.
Thank you.
>> Thank you, Senator. And I do have
that. I'm gonna ask a couple of middle
schoolers and middle school principals
who are here if they'd like to comment.
So they, they are on
my list.
Representative
Garrett.
>> Oh, thanks. I started to call you.
Thanks, Mr Speaker.
Thank you. Thank
you, Mr Chair. And, and
thank you, Jessica. This
really accurately
depicts the
purpose of those of us who
brought the um memorial
forward. So I'm very grateful.
Um and in answer
to Senator Lopez, actually
an AP S uh
student led parent
teacher, s are required.
And as a middle school
teacher, uh we
actually train the
kids to
be honest about their string.
So we, I don't know where your child goes
to school, but
that was a very robust
part of myself as a
middle school teacher
uh in my last three years of
teaching, um
just a couple of things in,
in all these categories.
Uh Mr Chair, if we
can always look at
the impact on
staffing because
with all the, you know,
if any area
really needs
those counselors
and stuff, it's middle school, that's
when, you know, sex,
drugs, smoking,
gang activity. I mean, a lot of
kids get
rooted on
a pathway frankly to criminal
activity because of their
disengagement.
But I mean,
who kept me staying in
middle school was red, the
janitor who went
to my church.
And so it's like every time
I went down the hall, are you doing what you're
supposed to be doing? Joy, blah, blah, blah,
blah. But, but that's the
thing we forget about the
secretaries, the bus
drivers
and the custodians
need to have some of
this training because they're
the ones that find the crying
kid in the, you
know, in the bathroom
and they're supposed to be wherever.
So just that note
and looking at that
staffing component,
what kind of counselors, what
kind of stuff
um it relates to the
training of staff members.
Uh The worst thing I ever
did as a student was in
sixth grade with a shared locker
and me and somebody made fun of
someone vice principal
called me in and said,
don't, you know, don't
criticize young love.
What she didn't know is that I was
bullying. So
we just have
to have that training for
teachers and counselors and
everybody and
then the advisory
curriculums.
Um I had a very loosey
goosey curriculum. My
last middle school.
So, you know, three days a
week you're with kids
and you
know, it was Lucy
goosey.
So we have to look at those
curriculums. And I liked, I
think it was
um I was gonna make
you a Senator
representative, Mirva
Mova. What you said about
starting in sixth grade with the
next steps, plans
wanted to be a brain surgeon
for three days because of a
film I saw in, you know, eighth
grade. It didn't work
out.
Um
Anyway, so just
always looking
at the staffing
component of
a school
and including that and
how we look at things
and then with the governor
asking the General
Aguilar to do the
pilot program, it's actually at Jimmy
Carter middle School in AP
S on the West
side. Um
She,
she asked the National
Guard get
involved in the middle school because
they have a very successful
program for dropout
like age 16.
Uh and I heard about that program
from a pediatrician who
was,
you know, found a
whole new life course through
that. So,
looking at
um is there a middle
school
at
New Mexico Coil? Yeah,
just that,
because they have such a,
more focus on
that physical activity.
I don't know about anybody else here. We
had pe, every year
in middle school and high
school. But now you
have one year in
middle school. And what do you have in
high school? One semester, one
year in high
school.
We, well,
marching band is pretty
physical a
anyway. But looking
at that curriculum,
um
diversity. So yeah,
just those are some comments,
I'm sure I'll come up with more later. Oh,
don't just use the student
council members for
student,
the the kid
that
I, you know, there's so
many smart kids that drop
out. And as Senator
Lopez said,
um
I, I know my mind's
all over the place.
Anyway. She, she talked
about um hearing the
voices of
kids anyway.
Thank you very much. Looking
forward to this.
>> Thank you, Representative uh
Senator Stewart.
>> So he's gonna do
that. >> Thank you, Mr
Chairman. I, I just wanted
to um
I just wanted to mention that
something that we
did in
uh in ap
si think we did it around
the state a number of years
ago when we started
having funding
to increase the
school year. Uh
Just remember the 10
days that was
flexible. People did
different things with
AP S did a
six
grade
uh jumpstart
boot camp for
a week before
school started.
And uh from
what I heard it was so
successful. Just
think of the sixth graders
there in their new
middle school or junior
high or whatever,
being there without anyone
else there so that
they could find their
classroom so that
they could meet each
other so that they
could, uh, you
know, form some of these
relationships or friendships
and not feel
so, uh, yikes
on that first
day. Uh, so
some things like that for
transition
I think are important for
us to uh to
look at. So it's
been a great conversation. I
can't wait to hear from the
principals and the
middle school
students uh
that we have here today. Thank
you. >> Thank
you, Senator uh Representative
Figueroa.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank
you, Jessica. We are
broadening your
work scope and your
load. Um And
I'm going to add a couple
more, but
I would like to add Mr
Chair to what Rep
Garrett was talking about
when we're talking about
staffing and workload.
And that relates, I think also
to what Senator Lopez
brought up and the
concept of scheduling
changes, block
scheduling. It's
gonna open up a
lot of questions and it may
even reach into
licensure issues.
If we want interdisciplinary
teaching. How
do we license for
that? And if
we have one teacher who
does interdisciplinary
teaching and
combine social
studies and language
arts, they'll
have a smaller number of
students that they have to know those
students will have an adult, they
know better. What kind of
impact would that have
in a middle school model? These
are big questions
and I think it's going
to continue to broaden for
quite a while before we
narrow down Mr Chair to
action we want to
take. Um
but I'm gonna add one
more thing to the mix.
New Mexico has some
nationally recognized
dual language models,
particularly at the elementary
level. And at that point
of transition,
when they move into middle
school, how is that
exacerbated if they
are falling out
or coming in
to a dual language system?
Are those
schools
effective? Do they get
different outcomes?
Um Is it a model we want
to encourage at the middle school
level?
It's an asset
to the state, our
language diversity that
we have and it
relates directly to
many populations in
our Yazzie
Martinez case
that need to be addressed and
included. So,
thank you, Mr Chair.
>> Thank you. Uh And
before we get to a couple of students,
I have a couple of questions
and certainly this is a
great discussion
as I sit here, this is
the discussion that ought to
be had in the colleges of
education in the principal
programs where
they can actually implement this
as well as this is a discussion
for superintendents and school
boards where they actually can
implement the different
models. Uh
I think it'd be dangerous
for us to try
and mandate a
particular model on
districts. It would
be a failure if it's
not coming from the local
group. So certainly us knowing
and understanding is important.
But I think about, you know, what
actual levers do we as
legislators have,
several people have brought
up the funding for
activities for,
you know, different programs for
different kinds of, of
things where we certainly
can, can be helpful.
Um Just because some of the
early data that you showed
that showed the
relatively flat
scores for
reading, but
substantial declines
in math being
a math teacher, I
wonder typically,
you know, and having been a middle school
principal, probably
two thirds or more of my
teachers were elementary
trained and
maybe a third were
secondary trained.
Well, that means, you know,
if they're teaching math in
middle school from
an elementary perspective, they're
starting to get afraid as they get
into pre-algebra
and algebra. And
I wondered if that's part of the
reason that
the math scores are dropping.
I don't know. I mean, that
was just something I looked at
is why the precipitous drop
in math but not in reading
where reading tends to be a
continuation of the elementary
curriculum. Whereas math gets
to be more difficult and more
complex as you go
through. Uh, I
know New Mexico has looked at and
maybe something
that more is within
our areas, whether to
put in a specific middle
school licensing,
uh option or
requirement for people
who are going
into that area and
field. When there's a
shortage of teachers, you know,
that might tend to limit
things even more and exacerbate
problems rather than make things
that I'm just kind of rambling
with comments
here. Uh
represent figueroa, you brought
up something when I was a middle school
principal. Uh partly
because it leveraged additional
state money to the seg
all of our my students
had to take Spanish every
year. It was a requirement
in the school and they've got
funding through the extra
increments for bilingual
education through
that. I
loved it. I thought it was
great for the community and
understanding. And I actually
wanted in seventh grade, let's
teach all of seventh grade in
Spanish instead
of in English for everyone
and a bunch of students like, whoa, that's
not fair. It's like, why is that
different than for the Spanish students
that have to do everything in English?
And in seventh grade, it doesn't affect your
GPA for whether you're gonna be
valedictorian or anything
of that sort.
But I just thought
if we really believe
in bilingual education to
have that
whole year done in Spanish
where English is the
second language and those who are more
comfortable in Spanish, suddenly they're
the, the smart ones,
the, the top of the
class ones and things of that
sort. But,
uh, more just kind of
those kinds of comments
is really
wanna think
that for us to be knowledgeable
about middle school is
important. But
we want to make sure that we're
staying with our lane and
empowering
superintendent school boards,
districts,
principals
to do good middle
school um
education if we
will and ensure that our
colleges of education
are fully training
teachers in the
elementary curriculum that goes
up through seventh grade, I
believe. But
there's very little discussion
about middle school
and I can tell you
1/7 and eighth grader
are incredibly different
from 1/6 grader who at the school
dance are still playing tag and
the eighth graders are over,
you know, as the students used to call it Maing
in the corner type of
thing, you know, all at the same school
dance within two or three years of each
other. Um you
know, and so having people who are
fully understanding and trained
in all of those areas. So
just as we're looking at this, I
think it's great for us to have
more knowledge, but we
want to be very careful that we're
not coming
in and mandating a particular
program which is
really in the purview
of principals, superintendents,
school boards, districts,
types of things.
Um, Jessica,
if you like to respond to any of that,
otherwise, I'm ready. I'm gonna
call on some of our principals
and students.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman.
Um I've just noted all of the,
the comments from all of you. We'll make
sure to thoughtfully incorporate all
of this. The only response
I'll add is that we're really hoping
for a very wide-ranging
working group. Um That was part
of representative Garrett's framing
for this, that was really important in
drafting the memor. And
so we want to have integrity
to that and really make sure
we are including a lot
of voices at the table and
that by-product
really helps you all to understand
what is the legislative role in
this and what may be the roles of other
parties involved is
part of our, our charge
too. So, thank
you all so much.
>> Thank you. And if they would
like, I'd love to
hear
Trish. Are you interested in saying
anything?
I mean, you sometimes
are very talkative until
it's more formal and then boy,
you get quiet as a mouse.
Uh Kiara,
would you like to comment, what are your
experiences on middle school? What
should we know
about?
Yeah, please come up to there's
a microphone up here. If
you're,
we would love to hear
your perspectives
and,
and what, what do you think middle
school or how it could be
better or serve you and
your friends
differently?
>> Um, thank you.
So,
what I really noticed going
to middle school is, you know, it was
really big adjustment
and what I've noticed in my
school is it's so big
and it's just,
it's made it very hard
and, um,
I feel like fun has really,
like, been taken
out of learning this year for
me. And
um my personal favorite class
has been my seminar, gifted
class. And the reason
for this is because we have
more hands on activities
in the learning environment.
And my other classes, I remember
being really excited to go into
science cuz you know,
I like,
I thought we were gonna be doing a lot of hands
on things and all
that and like
we were doing some of that
and for example, my seminar class
next year, we're gonna be dissecting
a sheep brain
and we
did a field trip.
It was a
five week I believe,
um thing
where we went to the Air
Force Base and we
were doing stem
activities.
And from this
experience, I really, I really
enjoyed it because we would be,
would like, we were able to do many
more hands on
things.
And
um
also what I've noticed, you know,
the size of my school
has been
so big, going
from elementary to middle school.
It's been very big.
And um what I'd like to
see is,
you know, us doing more hands
on things, possibly
our size being cut down
a bit because
um the
class, the sizes in my
classes have been pretty
big and
that's something that
I've not enjoyed, you
know, the size.
So, yeah, I,
I'd like to see that
happen.
>> Thank you.
And
>> that,
uh thank you, Mr Chairman, one of
the other. So,
along with the academics,
which has you very
well communicated,
what are some of the other challenges
of middle school? You, you
heard some of
the areas we're gonna
be studying?
Would you say that those are
pretty
accurate or is there things
that we need to take a look at
to support, not just the learning
in middle school but
also the other
things over the whole child?
Thank
you.
Question. I think >> that >> was
>> directed back >> at you. So
I guess I'll repeat it because I
know you were like, she's like, I
can't believe you put me here.
You're in the legislature. I'm
not uh I
guess the question to
repeat it, Mr Chairman
is, you know,
you talked about academics, you
talked about the hands on learning, which I
think is part of it. We've, we've talked
about the instructions and we've
talked about the classes.
But what about the other parts of middle
school as far as the
the school safety,
as far as far as some of the other
social issues?
What are some of the areas
that you see,
you know, being very, you know, kind of
general that we need to
take a look at to help
your learning environment and the
learning environment, your colleagues
be better.
>> Um OK,
so on
a daily, I'm
going into class thinking, you
know, um
you know what's gonna happen today is
like so and so gonna be
suspended because
just yesterday, my pe
two students were, you know,
vaping
and smoking
has been a huge
problem.
So
um
sorry
um
about, I think three
times this week already,
our teachers have had to come
talk to us about, you
know, our
behavior and
smoking and how, you
know, we need, we need to stop
it.
Um
And by the beginning of the year, I
remember coming into middle school
and there were like three
plus fights in the beginning of the
year coming in and
that was a huge
shock to me because I never
experienced that before.
So I feel like one of the main issues
that we have is smoking.
That's a
huge issue
and um kids
are sneaky with it. It happens a
lot. And the thing is,
you know, teachers say, you know, when
you see this stuff, you know, tell, but
like, they
don't want to tell because like, everyone
is in on it, everyone is friends
and like they cover for each other
or, you know, if it's like,
if I say something
so and so is going to come over here
and they're going to tell me something
or, you know, their
friends are going to come after me.
So,
smoking has been
the like biggest problem I've
seen and you know, I know our
principals have really been trying
to crack down on it,
but
it's still
a big problem.
So
>> and thank you. And I know I saw
Senator Lopez you talking your
daughter. Is there, is there anything as far
as that,
that you would like to add to that
maybe on your maybe through you
or
or?
>> Yeah, yeah, I
go Mr
Chair. We were talking as
your daughter was saying some
things too. There, there's some
issues. Um and
church was saying it's about conflict
resolution. The
teachers need more work
um training on conflict resolution
which deals with your issue. So
she was saying conflict resolution
and there is an issue about vaping
in schools.
So it it it is
happening
>> and thank you Mr Chairman and sorry,
I didn't mean I'm taking over the job,
but I need to gavel
myself right now. But
I want in on a positive note,
ok, this is positive we've talked
about this but I also
think is
in your experience, what could make the
experience better as far
as to, to be? Is it,
is it more clubs or activities?
Is it more,
um, time to,
um,
as far as get involved in schools?
You know, whether be student government
is that,
is there, is there, has there been some
positives in your middle school,
um,
experience?
>> Um, yeah, so some pauses
have been, you know, they offer counsel
at my school and
I know a couple of people like my friends
have been in it and, you know, I've considered
myself joining
um this
week alone, you know, a lot of people
have been like coming in from like
the high school to like, you know,
sign like kids up for like
the football team for
both the high school and the middle
school.
And um
yeah, they, they've been offering
like a lot of different like activities
and stuff but like,
you know, I would like to see more
because, you know, it's a lot
of the things they're not like offering isn't
for everyone, but
also um
some of the things that they've offered,
you know, is like e-sports,
they have that after school and
stuff like that.
And they also encourage students
to go like to the
library after school.
And they also provide us with
information about
like what activities you
can be like
in after
school.
>> Thank you, Kiara. Any other
particular questions for
Kiara? We'll let you off the hot
seat. Oh, representative
Fido. I want to ask you
>> thank you, Mr Chair and
thank you for talking to us. I
just was gonna ask about a
clarification because
you mentioned big. It's
really big and I
wasn't sure if you were referring
to the size of the campus,
the building or if you were referring
to the number of students in your class.
And if so how many
kids are in your class now? And how
many were there in your
elementary school? What's the
difference?
>> Yeah. So co coming into the
year I am, I remember
coming to the school and
there were so many kids
and you know, people will
be talking about
like different
people. And I'm like, oh, I don't even
know like who they are
because I remember
in my elementary school, I knew
everybody I
was very close with
like because there were only
about 20 kids in my
class and I was
used to be with that same group.
So the size
like of my school
last year to this year,
it was like dramatically
increased. So that was like just a
big shock to me.
And then plus in like my
classes, there's like 20
plus kids
and they're
much bigger and different
like people that like took
a long time to get used
to.
Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Kiara. It's hard to
talk for a bunch of legislators
and adults and to, to talk
openly. We so appreciate
you your openness and
stuff.
We do have two
middle school principals here, MS
Marquez and MS
Koffman. Would you all like to
come and tell us
your perspectives or, or
thoughts on things or,
you know, where we've got it right where we've
got it wrong and what we ought
to, how, as a
legislature, we might be able
to help you in your role and
jobs.
>> Good morning or? Good afternoon.
We're almost afternoon.
Um,
so as I'm sitting here thinking
and kind of listening to everybody's
comments, listening to
Miss Hathaway's um,
briefing that she gave you
all the one thing that
kind of comes to mind and, and I
think that a lot of us as adults
in the real world, um,
know that time. It's always
about time and money.
Right. And that's exactly,
I think Miss Coffin
would agree
with me on that. It's always about
time and money in the schools. Do
we have money for this? Do we
have the time? I know,
um Senator Lopez noted
that the teacher said, well, I can't
meet after school.
And why is that? Because their
duty day is over and the
contract is over. That's one
thing that we experience a lot
in middle school.
Um Our teachers
don't have the same prep
time as elementary
as elementary teachers,
which we, I am proud to
say though here in Los Luas for
a number of years, the middle
school and the high school has
done parent changer conferences,
which is a change. I, I believe
it was probably 2012
11. It was when my kids were in high
school that we started that.
So that's something that is a
positive here in Los Unas
that we have seen
as middle school
and secondary
schools. So we do have
that. Um
Kiara is actually one of my students.
She's been one of my babies for a really
long time on a personal
level, um as well. Um
with dance, she
is exactly correct. Vaping
is a huge problem since
I have been in the building since
10 o'clock. My assistant principals
have suspended three
students
and that's in, in one day our
school, she does talk about the school
being bigger. We're a
little bit under 750
students right now.
Um We try to cap
classes at 30. We
do have to follow the pe D
guidelines for English classes.
So those ones are usually a little bit
smaller. Um Again,
it comes down to time
and money do we have money for,
for, you know, more staffing
for more teachers?
Um It is an issue
that a lot of students have to have
kind of shared is because they go
from being with one set of
students for seven years, from
kindergarten to six and then
we mix them in. Our school
has I believe five feeter
schools. So it's five different
elementary schools that are all
that are all mixed up.
We do offer um
some different SCL
stuff to kind of help some of our
students. But again,
time and money, we
were lucky this year that our
school did get to add a
second social worker.
Um But again, it
comes down to the time and money
aspect. A lot of our extra
programs are based on grants
that aren't there.
Um So some social
workers, we've had some
concerns with special ed,
social workers and general ed
social workers. Well, the general ed
Social Worker grant is only for
three years. So we have
a staffing concern with that
because do you want to go to
accept a position that, you
know, may or may not be
there back
to the whole time in many aspects
of it?
>> I would
echo some of the similar
things. Our school is about. We're
sitting at about
475
currently at Valencia Middle School
on the east side of town in Las
Soas. Um So we are
a little bit smaller.
Um We also have five
feeder schools um
that cover
a wide range all the way up from.
Um is
Letta Pueblo all the way
down to tome
to that borderline of Bullen.
So we cover a wide
range of areas and all those
students come together
and meet each other. A lot of them know each
other from outside activities,
um sports, etcetera,
but a lot of meeting for the first time when
they first come to us.
And so that transition that
many of you talked about is
an abrupt one for many
of our kiddos
um which
just with the way that we are
structured where we
mimic a lot of
um very
much to high school
um with our, our
multiple class periods per
day, etcetera.
Um That is a transition
that we try to
soften the blow of when
they first come, our teachers do an
excellent job of really
building relationships with our
students, but also getting them
into that groove and that system and
we try to provide support
um a conversation that
that was had during the
previous session about principal
preparation and things.
Um and then has been mentioned about
teacher preparation
as I started out as
someone who wanted to be a middle school teacher
and I taught middle school math.
Um but when I
went through my teacher ed program, while
it was an excellent program,
there were not things designed
specifically for middle
school teachers and I
had to do a lot of that
independently. And so
I think is as you all
are talking to higher education
departments about teacher preparation
and teacher residencies.
There does need to be
an aspect of that, that is
focused on the development
of middle school teachers
and, and really looking at
those age groups from 10 to
14. Um I think it
would be interesting as far as the research
too, how many Preser
teachers are interested in going
into middle school? Because I bet you'll
find the numbers are not very
high. And that's really
where
um we
have struggled over the last few
years and even when I was a teacher,
we struggled in finding teachers
who a wanted to be part
of a middle school, um
and who wanted to stay
in a middle school. Um
And part of that is training,
but also part of that is not
understanding the complexities
of working with middle school Children
um because they are complex
individuals to
say the least.
Um So that would be
something I think to
be considered is,
you know, with that training, with
the time and the money
concern.
Um and just
with staffing overall, if
we're going to provide
extra pe and extra
movement, if we're going to provide
extra training, extra
staff, we have to have the
funding for it. Um
We do the best that we
can with what we have and I have
an excellent staff. I have
excellent people who
support.
Um
but it's hard when you,
when you have to train them
right out of college when they should come
to you train um
because they don't focus on,
on middle schoolers.
Um So that's a huge
challenge.
Um
As far as the
extra programs, I mean, we've been very
lucky here in Los to have
a lot of great opportunities for our
students. Um Kara
mentioned e-sports Student
Council, um
those types of things.
Um
but
with that again,
time and money
and you know, do
we have,
is it, is there a longevity
to it that we're going to be able to
sustain those programs?
And then on top of that,
a couple of people mentioned parent
involvement,
I think it from
our perspective or my perspective
as an administrator and as a
teacher,
um
our teachers really try to,
you know, be as
communicative with parents
as possible. Um It
is challenging when you go
and you have 100 and 60 kids
on your
caseload, essentially, even as
a general education teacher, you
have all the grading to do, we
have to keep up with the expectations of
testing. Um
and those legal requirements
and those state requirements that we
have. Um
But then we, we see a
dramatic decrease in
the actual amount of parent
involvement. Um As
a principal, there are many times that
I call and say, hey, I just wanted to give
you a heads up and the parent is
very nonchalant
about the issue or we
try to provide services and
there's very little follow
through.
Um
and we do as much as we
can at the school site,
offering those outside
services and
so better ways that
middle schools
or our communities
can help even educate
parents on how to work with their
students at those
ages. Um
Because I would venture to guess
many parents are also frustrated.
I hear that a lot. I don't know what to do with
them either. Um So how
do we also provide community
support um either
within our schools or within our
other resources that are
outside of the schools
to help
parents
um
best support their own
students and
communicate in partnership
with the actual
schools?
>> Thank you both. Um And
I would like to ask you the
superintendent if you've got any
comments around this
discussion as you have to
kind of oversee and
supervise and
make budgets and other things
work with it as
well.
>> Principle, I will
share.
Uh Thank you for asking me to
speak. I find your,
your uh brief,
very interesting and I find it
to be true as we
look at this as was
mentioned earlier, it is time and
money and that's why we
have classes of 30
because we don't have the,
the,
the staff. I, I find
it interesting.
S so
I, and I was a middle school teacher
for 19 years. I ended up
in middle school
because there wasn't a waiting list
at U and M to get into coll
into that program. I'm,
I'm, I'm an
alternatively
licensed teacher. I was
an accountant before I became a
teacher. And when I went
back to school
at U and M, they
um he said
there's a waiting list for high school. There's a waiting
list for elementary. I had kids. I had a
family, I need to get a job.
And so I went into the mid-level
program and I, I guess that doesn't
exist anymore, but there was a
gentleman at U and M, Doctor
Don Kelly that
trained us to
be middle school
teachers.
And I found that
very,
when you talk about the things
that in your brief,
that was very helpful as
I sit there and reflect on, on
my past is being
trained how to
um work
specifically with those
students. You
talk about the,
the,
the mindset, the, the
shift we've looked at the work of
Doctor Ruby Payne with brain
development and emotional uh
poverty.
And the biggest thing I can I
I take from that
is middle school kids wanna
know why
they revolt against
authority of rebel
because we don't tell them the
why we tell them
do this and
we don't explain why when
we start to explain the
why they're not
always gonna agree. But they're
starting to become logical
also so they can
get it.
I think your brief,
the work that you guys will do will
help us. I, I agree with you.
Senator Souls do
not legislate it.
That would be a
nightmare
but give us the opportunity
to have a voice
and um
determine what, what works
best for us. You know, Senator
Lopez, I, I appreciate
your story talking about your
son. I would
encourage you
with your all the free time that
I know that you have is
to look into the new New
Mexico Universal
Design for Learning project.
We Belin schools is,
is gonna, this will be our
first year in this.
And what I
like about it, it provides
voice and choice for all
students and it's
training teachers how to
provide voice and
choice. And I think it'll be very effective
at the middle school level
because it's not,
this is the one way that you can
show me how to, how
you're meeting the standards. There's
multiple ways that we can
show you how to meet the standards. And again,
it goes back to the teacher
capacity. The other thing
I like about it is it
provides
um
using A I
tools for
all all students,
whether they have learning disabilities
whether they're el so
they have a translator
that the, the student
can translate into,
they can type in Spanish and it'll
translate it to English.
It has readers
that are automatic and it's just
part of the student's device
and that I think as we
start to explore things with
the help of your brief cause you, you
gave me some ideas too. I
I'm gonna tell you the biggest
idea. So
where's our middle schools? Seven through
eight. We need
to look at sixth graders.
I need to, we need to look at
sixth graders differently. Yes, they're part
of elementary.
But why are we waiting till they reach
seventh grade to start
looking at that?
How, how do we
teach them differently? How do we work
with them differently? Because we are. That's
when we started experiencing
a lot of the problems that uh
Representative Baca's
daughter talked about
and vaping
and it's not, it's
not when I
was a principal at the middle school.
It was vaping tobacco products. They're
vaping THC
products now.
And that's scary because
they don't know what it does
to them. And we end
up transporting, we haven't lost
any yet, but we end up transporting
them. It goes back to
what I talked about when you
guys were in Berlin.
We need to intervene
right away
what you heard. Time and money. You're,
it's right. But we do have
resources. How can
we use those resources
in an intentional
way? To
intervene before it
becomes a big problem.
And now we
have a,
we have behaviors that are affecting
the culture of our school. And
I'm not gonna say it's gonna be perfect.
We're, we're working on
this, but we have
to try something.
We can't just stand by and say, well,
they're being middle
schoolers,
I'll, I'll stop. I could talk
about middle school all day. I'll
stop there. Thank >> you.
Thank you. I'm kind of the same way as
some of the best years of my,
my edgy by uh career
is when being the two years I spent
as a middle school principal there.
Fascinating kids. But I
think 6/7
or seventh grade girls are the most
complicated creatures in the
world.
Unbelievable. I've been
fascinating but
you know, it's very difficult to
understand.
Uh I think this
ends uh our
meeting uh
we are next
in Chama on
June 2627
and 28. So up
in the cool northern New
Mexico area,
hope to see people
and able to travel there. If you're
traveling today, please travel
safely and carefully. And
I am always so honored
to be a part of such an amazing
committee with so many
educators who are
deeply engaged. Stay at the end
of the meeting, asking
good questions and want to make
a difference in New Mexico
for our kids. So thank you
all and for, for me
being allowed to, to chair
this committee, have safe
travels and our
yes and our amazing
staff, you know, who supports
us in everything that we do so
very much. Appreciate it.
And thank you to both the
Berlin and the Los Luna schools
for the great hospitality over the
last couple of days.
