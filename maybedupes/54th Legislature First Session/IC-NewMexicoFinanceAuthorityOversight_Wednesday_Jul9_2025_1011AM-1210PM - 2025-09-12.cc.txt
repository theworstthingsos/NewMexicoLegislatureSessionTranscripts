Thank you so much for hosting us.
I want to invite mayor

I'm the senate majority whip. I represent
the almost exact
area I circle.
Representative de La Cruz's
there have the southern
portion of Bernalillo County. I've
been a voting member of this committee the
entire time I've been here and
it's been a joy and
mister mayor, we know more about your
city. I bet I could give your
speech now.
You are so kind and so wonderful
to us and, and I also want to
thank Mister Manzano who is here
with us today as well and
just, I'm sure you just got
a number of things to do and then
you know, the clamp thats show up on your
university campus here. So
here we are and we're just so grateful
for all the kindness that you show us.
I also want to thank Marquita
Russell and her team from New Mexico
Finance Authority. Continue
to keep us right on track with
everything that they're up to and all the
hard work that they're doing. So
with that, we're going to go
ahead and move over and thank
you, representative, I'm sorry, Senator
Senator Brantley
for hosting us as well. I
want to go over to Mister Mayor to
talk about
Socorro.
>> Thank you, Mr, chair committee
members or Senator
Brantley. Uh You
left uh one
of our favorite sons, Ryan
Geen home with you at NM
FA. He works for, he's from San
Antonio. His father ran the
Buckhorn. So he's been a
great asset to us uh
from our
area. And
again, welcome. And I know a lot
of people have already been here once
and that's been great.
We'll host every time
anytime you want to have a committee.
Uh but also come see
our convention center that you help
the Bankroll. And so I
want to just go over the things that NM
FA has done for us. I
have with me, Ruby Lopez,
the finance
director and she's actually
has more information than I do.
I'm just the mouth. She's the one that
does all the work. So let
me, let me start with you.
Uh The city of Socorro is
one of the small cities that has
a landfill and
we initially
started the landfill
certification process about
20 years ago and we
finally got a certified about
15 years ago
and we have, uh it's
expensive. Uh The, the
tipping fees are bit more
than what you would get in
Sierra, Colorado or some other
places. But we have
the city and the county
and, uh, you'll hear from Magdalena
also. Mayor Rum is here.
But, and Alamo,
they all use our
landfill and you have
helped us in the beginning,
uh, to, uh, start
it. We just open up
a new cell. A new
cell is a million dollars
and, uh, you issued that
in May 15th. Uh
You also did our waterline
replacement. Uh You've
uh Rodeo Arena is one of the
best, if not the best in the
state, we feel, uh, you
started that and with the Senator
Moles and uh
representative
trip at one time are the ones
who really helped us to
start it. And then,
uh the governor helped us, but
you have given us a million
five back
in 2013 and
that really set us
started. We, we, that
probably is uh
uh worth
more than that now. But,
uh we, we certainly
appreciated that again.
Infra infrastructure
projects such as the gas
valve project
which helped us
put, get a
bigger, our gas line.
We run the utility, our
gas line comes from
Berlin and it's a
40 mile
uh distance
and we had to replace some
of the valves inside the
gas line to be
able to be, have the gas line more
efficient. And so that
you helped us with
that,
the fire truck,
very important for us.
Uh you helped us with that, that
fire truck. Now, this is
2017,
but
2024 that
fire truck now is a million
dollars.
It was 417,000
or it was 425,000
at one time. But
uh
the amount of money that it takes
to buy equipment now
is almost doubled.
Uh The Convention
Center which is an old
armory. I
know Mr Quintana said he was
in the mechanized or he
was in one of the
National Guard battalions
that used to use that.
But uh General Salas
turned that over to us uh
several years
ago and you can see this is back
in 2020 we've
remodeled that into a convention
center and I hope that you have a
meeting in our convention
center and show you what this
money did for us. Uh
The Vector truck is
another infrastructure
thing and this was back in
2020. It was
250,000.
And if you look at communities
now, a vector
truck is almost 300 to
$400,000.
Uh the wells for
the, the meters,
the landfill.
Another project that we
just started, this is the
New Cell with a million
million six.
Uh Again, if you notice the
interest rates are really
very favorable to us, you
know, at one time, we used to
go have bond issues.
Uh We had Kyas and
company I've been, I've been married
for about 33
years and we used to
have, we used to
have Kas and company do our
bond and that was
back, uh,
maybe 2530 years
ago. We'd have to do
that. I never went to New
York to sell the bonds, but
they would take you to New York and
have all this thing. But with
the N MA, uh,
and for
good or bad is, is really
done good for the cities and
the municipalities when
we can get this kind of interest
rate and not to have bond attorneys
and all that. So it's been, it's
been very good. The last
thing, two things.
Uh, we are
a
natural gas utility
and the
VW settlement,
uh, the, the
penalties that they
paid, we
got a $2 million
grant to convert
our diesel
and I must say it's not
electric, but it's
natural gas.
And we felt the
natural gas was the
next logical
thing to go to rather than
electric.
An electric
garbage truck is
$800,000.
And that's, and that's a rear, it's
a rear loader
26
cubic yards.
A natural gas
garbage truck is
$480,000.
A diesel truck is
350,000.
Used to be 220.
Uh, so what we did was
we, with this VW
settlement, uh,
we did
buy three dump trucks
that are natural gas because we're the
utilities, we fill it
up and
we got two
residential
garbage trucks for
a million, almost 500
each. So that, that was
part of the bridge loan that you guys
provided us. And then a
landfill compactor
2023.
A compactor
used to be 405
100,000
and it was,
it's 900. The new one that we
got was 900,000. So
that's a total of 9 million,
600,000. Our
outstanding principal is down to
5 million,
486,000.
Uh We do have,
we do have a bank account with
you which pays pretty
good interest with
the finance authority and, and
we're, we're certainly happy to
invest that.
And so, uh I
can only say thank you very
much. Uh The new Mexico
Finance Authority has been a boon
for a small community like
ours and we
hope you continue the good job
and give Ryan
Olgin a
raise.
Thank you again, chairman,
committee members.
>> OK. Thank you very much.
Any other comments from your
neighbor
there,
>> Ruby,
>> I'm Ruby Lopez. I'm the finance
director and I do work with N
MA and it's,
it's really, it's an easy process
with them and we do
qualify for 100 and 50,000
disadvantage. So,
um it does help out a lot
and of course, the interest rates are
good. Thank
you.
>> OK. Thank you very much.
Just looking around to see if we have
any comments or
questions about. All right,
I'll come for you to you for an
introduction. First representative
Thera of yourself. And then if
you have any questions for the presenters.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you committee.
Uh Thank you presenters. Thank you very
much for your presentation.
I'm Luis Terrazas District
39 in
Grant Hidalgo in Catch
Counties near
Silver City. And so
I'm glad to be here. Thank you for,
uh you know, tell me what
you, while making your
presentation. I just
real quick. You kind of caught
my attention when you started talking
about the uh
payload of
the electric.
Um, what was it? A
garbage truck?
And so I just wanted to just
quickly ask you, did it change
the payload from because of the batteries
or so forth from that
uh electric um
garbage truck to
a diesel one? Can you
explain that to me
or even the, I guess the
natural gas one? Can you give me the
payload differences if you have
them? >> No, Mr
Chairman committee member,
representative,
uh the payload didn't
change. Uh They're,
they're good strong trucks. But
then the other thing I didn't mention
with that, you have to put in about a
2 $250,000
charging station.
So on top of that,
after you get the truck,
so no, the payload,
they, they'll go anywhere from
22 to 30
cubic yards. And our, you know,
our regular, that gives
you usually one
trip around, we pick up about
400 uh, at
one time, 450
cans. And
so that, that
you can make one trip around with
that, uh, without having,
and you can go into small areas
if you have a, I mean, if you get the
big, we don't have a front end, a
front loader, we have the rear
loaders with a hydraulic
winch. And so
it's about the same
sizes, same thing with the
natural gas and the diesel.
They're all the same size.
>> Yeah. And, and you answered my second
question that about
the um charging
station. So, thank you very much.
That's all I wanted to hear. Thank you very much.
Thank you.
>> Thank you very much.
Uh Representative just looking around to
see if we have any others.
All right, Senator
Rodriguez, if you'll introduce yourself
and also if you have questions for our
presenters. >> Thank you, Mr
Chairman. Good morning to the
presenters. Um I'm
Nancy, Senator Nancy
Rodriguez from Santa Fe
and I don't have any questions.
I'm here with
you today and tomorrow, Mr Chairman.
Thank you.
>> Ok. Well, thank you very much. I
think that you've
presented. Actually, I'm guessing
two or three times now to
some of the committee members here. So we're
just very thankful that you've
welcomed us. Your, your nice
central geographic location in the
state, really helps us to get to you
rather easily. So, thank
you very much for your presentation. We're
going to go ahead and moving on. Thank
you. >> Thank you very much. Thank
you. Thank you committee members.
>> Ok. So now we're going to ask
to go to the next item
here
update on the drinking water
state revolving loan fund.
We'll have John Brooks, chief
of Programs, New Mexico
Finance Authority,
Michael
Vanderheide, managing
director, public Programs,
New Mexico Finance
Authority.
>> Good
morning.
My name is John Brooks. I'm the
chief of programs with the New
Mexico Finance Authority and
my colleague.
>> Good morning, Mr Chair and members of
the committee, Michael Vanderheide with the New
Mexico Finance
Authority.
>> So, what you see before
you is um
an update on our
drinking water state
revolving loan fund program.
This is one of our
legacy programs at the
Finance Authority. Um
and we'll go over this
particular program and,
and give an update
um started with the
background in regarding
the Jika Water State
revolving loan fund. It
was established in
1996
part of the
Federal uh Safe
Jika Water Act,
which was
designed to uh
repair, replace
and, and create safe uh
Jika water
infrastructure throughout
the United
States.
And so this was a, a federal
program that was passed by
Congress in
1997. Congress
then began to appropriate
and an annual
funding mechanism
uh for this particular
program and then beginning
uh to
create awards from
the Environmental Protection
Agency or
EPA um
through a capitalization
grant mechanism
in that particular uh
grant, what it
uh what it
allows for us to do
as a state is
put in the evidence of plan
of how we will fund
programs.
Um and then
uh fund different
set asides or
activities within the
program, but
also uh create
a what we call a fundable
list of all the
projects that we fund
on an annual
basis
with that particular
fundable list. And,
and that application
through a attended use
plan, the state is to
provide a 20%
match uh
for the funds. So
every time we apply for the
grant, we have to identify a
20% state match.
Um in order to go
with uh the, the
funds that we come from
the federal uh
federal uh
allocation
based on the state uh Jica
Water uh revolving Foma
Act.
Uh It
isn't
administered jointly
by the
Economic Development. I mean,
economic, the,
the New
Mexico Environment Department,
the through the Drer Water Bureau
and also the New Mexico
Finance Authority.
The Finance Authority is the
state's grantee.
We're responsible for
submitting the grant
um and the
applications to EPA
and also provide
the, the state
match, providing
financial assistance,
administer the loan,
monitor the projects
and the financial
reporting.
Since the exception of
the program, we have
made 100 and 90
loans, tolling
$390
million throughout the State
of New Mexico
in 2011.
Uh uh there were some changes
at the federal level
uh which require a
federal subsidy
um that, which NM fa
delivers to all our
loan recipients or most of
our loan recipients uh
through a principal
forgiveness. Because
the way that the act is structured,
we are unable to provide
grants so we can't
make a grant and,
and, and a loan combination.
What we do is provide a
principal forgiveness
and then a loan
component after
that. And
so with that, that
is sort of the background of
the drinka water uh
revolving loan fund
program and Michael
will go into some of the
components of the
program.
>> Thank you John and good morning
again mister >> and excuse
me, my apologies,
Mike. I hate to interrupt
you. We did establish
a quorum and I want to make sure that I get these
minutes approved on the official
record. So I'm just going to take a
brief break here
for just a second. You
have minutes in front of you committee. We do
have a quorum. These were
sent to you several days ago. It
was about a week ago. Um
I'll entertain a motion to
adopt our minutes from the last
meeting,
Senator Rodriguez Moot.
Do we have a
second
representative
Thompson has second all
those in favor. Say aye,
all those opposed say Nay
Ayes have it
adopted. Thank you
very much committee. Thank you, sir. Please
proceed.
>> I >> got >> it.
Got
it.
My apologies, Mr Chairman and
members of the committee.
Um As John mentioned, we're
providing an overview
of the drinking water, state revolving
loan fund. He
also mentioned that
27% of
those federal capitalization
grants are used for
set aside activities
mostly at the New Mexico
Environment Department. They
have a capacity development
program, they have a small systems
technical assistance
program. The Environment
Department is also the Primacy
Agency for the State
and So they're responsible for the
public health aspects of
the program in enforcing
the safe drinking Water Act
and, and implementation of those
set aside activities.
The Environment Department is also
responsible for reviewing
and ranking projects that
submit pres
and providing a fundable
list of projects
that are prioritized by the
Environment Department for the
finance authority to fund
from the loan
fund
eligible entities. Very
broad eligible entities, really,
any public water
system that's publicly
or privately owned or
community water systems,
nonprofit noncom community
public water systems are eligible
for the program. So
if a water system has a
public water system number,
they are eligible, whether they
are public or
private,
some eligible projects for the
drinking water state revolving loan
fund, drinking water
treatment, water lines,
storage tanks,
wells, meters
interconnections between
systems. And
now with the recently passed
bipartisan infrastructure
law, we're also funding
lead service line inventories
and eventually replacement of
those lines if they're to be
found and emerging
contaminants studies
that are ongoing and treatment
for those types of projects as
well.
And so turning to slide
four,
I mentioned the bipartisan
infrastructure law, the bill.
This is a very acronym
heavy program.
So I apologize in advance for
that. But
historically, we'd received
about 8 million to
11 million in
federal funding for this
program up until
about 2002.
That's when the bill increased
funding levels for the drinking water
state revolving loan fund
and it did add those two new
subprograms as
well, the lead service line
replacement program as
well as the emerging contaminants
program. So
with that increased funding
in, in state fiscal
year 2023
we received a total of $25
million in federal
funding through our regular
base grant as well as a
general supplemental grant that was
authorized by that act
again. N MA
provided that 20%
match that's
required through the
PPR. You're familiar
with the PPR
Appropriations
bill? Thank you,
Representative Garrett for carrying
that last year that
allows us to provide the
state match for the
drinking water, state revolving loan
fund. Last
fiscal year 2024
we received a total of more than
61 million in federal
funding that included the
base program, general
supplemental, as well as the
lead service and emerging contaminants
programs that I mentioned
earlier.
Again, we provided that 20%
state match through an
appropriation from the
PPF. That was a $6
million
appropriation.
This fiscal year, we
already have three applications
in for federal
capitalization grants. Those are
totaling more than 35
million. We have another
cap grant application development,
perhaps a second emerging
contaminants grant.
Those are about $7
million. The
state will not be submitting
an application for the most recent
allocation of the lead service
line inventory.
It has not been
much demand for that funding.
We received $28
million last year, we are
working through that
funding. We've allocated about
half of the loan fund out to
projects that are
proceeding with those lead service
line
inventories.
Turning to page
five. John also
mentioned the subsidy
factor of
this program
from 2011
when subsidy first was
introduced into the program.
Prior to that, it had been 100%
loan through
2022.
We were required to deliver a
minimum of 6%
of our annual
capitalization grants
to provide that
subsidy to
disadvantaged community
assistance or disadvantaged
community assistance program.
The bill increased that mandate
to a minimum of 61%.
So that is a large amount
of dollars then going
to
entities that qualify
for the disadvantaged Community assistance
program. So we did
make some changes to the policies.
In 2022
we increased the number
of entities and communities
in New Mexico public Water
Systems
that would benefit that would then
qualify for that
disadvantaged funding.
That change resulted in
about 200
additional severely
disadvantaged areas in the state
which then can get the maximum
of subsidy available under
the program.
We made additional changes last
year in 2023
to incorporate the lead
service line program and the emerging
contaminants program.
The emerging contaminants
program is
essentially grant like terms.
It offers 100%
principal forgiveness on all those
loans.
You'll see a breakdown
of some of the changes that we made in
2022.
What we began to do is
look at affordability
criteria and
compare our communities
to the National Mhi rather
than the state Mhi.
It's a national program
we felt that was appropriate.
It certainly has opened the door
to many communities who can
now take advantage of better interest
rates and additional
disadvantaged funding and
additional subsidy.
Any disadvantaged
community would receive 50%
principal forgiveness under this
program, severely
disadvantaged 75%.
You can see the percentages we
use there for severely disadvantaged.
75% or less of
the national Mhi would
qualify for that 75%
funding.
And then between 75
less than 100 would qualify
for that 50%
of federal subsidy on their
loans from the finance
authority. We
also removed a
cap. We used to have a cap up
to $1 million
to fund at 0%
and the remaining would be
funded
a nonage. We removed that.
So it is 0%
interest for all of our
folks that qualify under the
disadvantaged Community Assistance
program. We in
fact took a page from the Environment
Department's Clean Water
Program and moved our
interest rate down from 1%
on the non
communities to
0.01%.
And these loans can go up to
30 years for
folks that qualify for the
Disadvantaged Community Assistance
program.
Turning to slide
six,
we want to mention some of the current
program activity.
It's important to note we have
performance measures from the
EPA they
measure the utilization rate
really against all available
funding sources. Those are the
cap grants we talked about that
we apply for plus
the state match which comes
from the PPF and
then also principal and interest
repayments that are coming back into
the fund. We call those tier two
funds, but those are
available to be lent out as
well.
Historically, it's been a
difficult program to run
with all the other funding
sources available
that, that offer grants in
terms of capital outlay. The
grant portion of Water Trust
Board and Colonial
Infrastructure Board can
be up to 90%
of grant like terms for
those programs and other
low-cost loans that are available
through the PPR
and the New Mexico Environment
Department's Rural
Infrastructure program.
But we continue to forge
on the increased
federal funding and
those new program initiatives
have made it a bit of a
challenge to meet those
rigorous utilization
requirements. But performance
is strong. We have
overcommitted our loan fund
by about $35 million.
We're able to do that because of
the revolving nature of the
fund with those interest
and principal payments coming
back into the fund as well
as additional grants. We're
able to overcommit
the fund. We use some
cashing
to make sure that we have sufficient
funds when
those
are.
And over the past couple years, we
want to mention, I think with, with many
other construction
programs that our, our
disbursements were were
lagging in
comparison to the number of
awards we make and the
number of loans that we've closed
and that those high dollar
amounts
primarily just due to competing
projects and priorities
of other funders.
But we want to mention that we've got
23 projects now
that are in construction,
that's over a $75
million that
are in construction. Now it bodes
bodes well for
disbursements coming through
to the program. In this fiscal
year, we've already
processed about
$5 million in disbursements
here just in the first two months
of fiscal year,
2025.
And so that is a really
positive sign for
the program. We
have our project oversight
manager here, Donie Quintana
whom, you know, he
is now actively involved in
monitoring these projects.
He's looking at
drawdown schedules,
project completion timelines,
really just a
great resource for
us to keep these projects
moving, to get the money into
the ground and just to
continue the success of the
program.
The final slide number
seven is a chart
we want to show the
last six years, the last
fiscal years,
2019 through
2024. In
terms of our binding commitments,
those are awards, those are
projects that are approved by our
board as well
as the volume of
loans that we've closed. And
then of course, the
disbursements,
you see that the disbursements
are, you know, in a sort of
9 to $10 million
range over the last couple of years.
But the number of awards we've
made in the dollars of between
60 70 million for
the last three fiscal years.
And we did close
$93
million in loans for this program
in, in fiscal year
2024.
That's a, that's a record for the
program. So we
certainly saw a little bit of a downturn
through the pandemic. But the
increased funding from the
bill, our
additional oversight that we're
providing again,
it really bodes well for the future of
the program. we've
got, this is our
third year of bill funding. We'll
have two more years of the
bipartisan infrastructure law,
increase funding levels
and we feel that the program
is on the right track, but we want to
show you where we've been and, and
where we hope to go.
And so with that mister Chairman,
I think that concludes
the slides
and John and I would be happy to
answer any questions from the
committee.
>> Ok. Thank you very much for
your very efficient
presentation. Thank you
just learned so much from you
guys. Um All right,
I'm just looking around to see if we
have uh some
questions here. I have
a representative
Kates.
>> Uh Thank you chair and thank you very
much for your presentation.
Um I know that
a absolutely was a
very efficient presentation,
but just to
clarify,
the low disbursement
amount
is not during the COVID
years, it's
this year.
So I'm assuming part
of that disbursement amount
is low because
is that this year
or is it we're calling it
24 and it was dispersed
last year
>> disbursements.
Mister Chairman, remember
the disbursements that were processed
in fiscal year
2024.
>> And thank you. And you said
that they're
low because there are other
funders out there
yet. You've
closed so many.
So
is it just a matter of
timing or do you
see that
people are scrambling to
try to access right
now, >> Mister Chairman
and Member, I would say
that it
really has just been all the,
the issues that we've, that we
know about in terms of just
inflation and construction
contracts and you know,
sort of a lack of, of
bidding and bids that come
in higher than the
funding sources that are
available. And just those things
just delay, they end
up delaying the disbursements
for the project. So while
the projects have been approved,
while the loans are closed,
we've just seen various
reasons which are national
reasons. I don't know that they're specific
to New Mexico that
have just really delayed those
disbursements getting out the
door. But now we
see here in the first two months
already of this fiscal year,
you know, we've processed half as much
as we did all of last
fiscal year. So we feel
it's on the right track, just various
reasons for those delays and
just getting to actual
construction and getting the
money in the ground.
>> Thank you. Thank you madam chair. I
just one other
question. You see that the
the, the
lead service line
replacement
are for community
water systems.
Wood public
school
systems
that are obviously a part
of community water
systems. Would they be
eligible for these
lowest loans?
>> Mister Chairman? Yes. If,
if they, if they have a public
water system number and they are a
school that is
delivering water and they
are part of the drinking water
bureaus under their
purview as a public water
system then. Yes, absolutely.
They would be eligible for the
program.
>> So thank you mentioned 11 last.
So you're saying that our
public school system,
so uh are, are
the public school systems
accessing this to be
able to replace
lines going
into
our our buildings, our
public school buildings, >> Mister
Chairman member, I would say
that the Environment Department has been
working with the with the public
schools and, and schools
in general on
these issues prior to
this funding being
available. We have not
had a school system
come in yet to
to do an inventory.
It's been other mostly
municipalities
but yes, we have not had
one come in
yet.
>> Thank you madam
chair.
>> Thank you uh
Representative
Roybal Caballero. You're
next. >> Thank you madam
chair and thank you for your
very thorough presentation.
I back to page
four. I also
have questions concerning
the um
the
non application. The
last item on the on the
page where
you're not going to
seek um
submit another
application and
it's sort of along the same
lines um
it concerns me
because as we all
know, that is a
major factor in
really older pipelines
piping systems.
And we also
understand madam
chair that our
schools are antiquated
and other public
structures are
as well. County courthouses,
city halls. So
on. So how
do we um
besides the Environment
Department, how do
we
ensure
that we're actually meeting a
need? Perhaps they're
not applying,
maybe that has something to do with
the way in which we're outreach
or maybe information flow,
whatever have you been
able to gauge
why that is? And
then um
how we can
intervene
so that we don't
necessarily so that
they can apply. Thank you, madam
chair,
>> madam, chair and member
Royal Cerro. That's an
excellent point.
We absolutely do
rely on the Environment
Department as the
enforcement arm if you will,
the compliance arm
of this program
and of the Safe Drinking Water
Act to
make sure that they are reaching
out to
everybody who's eligible for
this program. We
we do the same at our level, at
the Finance authority.
I know that
many and I can't
speak to if it's schools, but
many applicants have started
the process. They've submitted
that pre
they just simply need to follow
up with the Environment Department
and make sure that they're providing the
supporting documents
that the Environment Department needs
to put those entities then on
a fundable list that
then is delivered to the
Finance Authority through what's called
an intended use plan.
So I know it sounds
alarming in terms
of the sort
of lack of, I
don't, it may not be a lack of
interest. It's just that folks have not
provided all the documentation
that they need to get through the
pre process
so that they can be put on a fundable
list. We did receive
28 million last year
for, for the lead service
line funding. As I mentioned
earlier, we're about halfway
through that allocating that
to water systems.
Those are really just
for the inventories
to under understand
what are the materials, what
are those water lines made out
of? And so
we're, we're working through that,
but to then
apply for an additional
28 million on top
of that as we're still working
through is
just money that as of
now would, would
probably not be put to use as
we're still working through that first
grant. So I absolutely
understand your concern. I
think there are folks that are in the
system, they just haven't made it
all the way to us
yet.
>> Thank you madam madam madam
chair representative.
In terms of the the
other portion of your question
regarding outreach,
our staff is
um attending
various conferences. So,
you know, the drinka water conference,
sort of the uh and
also the infrastructure
conferences and
also going to
and you know, uh different
stakeholder meetings of which
we're talking to uh
public water systems
about these particular programs.
And as Michael alluded to
once we, you know, we make the
connection at, at that
level, they have to follow
through and make the application
through the Vrant Department.
>> Thank you madam chair. Uh
follow up
question
is
in the grant
application process,
is there anything that prohibits
us from
applying
um or
reapplying I would say, or
getting requesting
another grant?
And when is the next funding
cycle, the next
uh, application
cycle that you can tap
into. I'm just
wondering if,
um, the feds have restricted
our ability or is it
just part of our fiscal
management that we want to make
sure that we're getting as
much done under one
and completing that?
Because it really does concern
me because inventories is a
critical,
it's critical
that these inventories
occur. And
also it
concerns me because in the smaller
rural communities where our
school districts are
remote and so
on, um they
probably are the most in
need. And so
I'm just wondering if we're
placing our own restriction
on not reapplying
or is there something in the
grant application that prohibits
us from doing so,
>> madam chair and representative,
I don't know that there's anything in the
grant application that would, that
would prohibit us from
doing so, but we
certainly have been meeting with EPA
regarding these cap grant
applications,
making sure
that there there will be future
applications available.
There is two more years
of bill funding
that will include additional
funds for the Lead Service line
program as well as the emerging
contaminants program.
Now, there may be changes at the
national budget level of
how those funds get allocated,
but they certainly have been
consistent with the funding levels
and allotments for the states
throughout this time period.
So there will be there
will be additional opportunities
for the state to apply
for future dollars.
This one, this
this next one just
did not seem
appropriate given
the, we do not have
a fundable list of projects
if you will to move forward, we're
still working through that,
that first grant, but
things are starting to pick up a little
bit. >> Thank you madam
chair. And finally, I would just say
that the we we
need to find ways to kind of
increase our outreach
maybe through the school board
association or
superintendents, whatever
it takes to
get word out
into those smaller communities.
Thank you madam
chair.
>> Any other
questions? I,
I have one question for
the two of you
in our state. We often have drinking
water emergencies a
couple of years ago, it was
trauma is
the drinking water State
revolving loan
fund and
NM FA in conjunction
with the environmental
department. How do
you address those
emergencies where
people haven't gone through
this process
because it's an emergency.
Is that a role that you
play
>> madam chair? Yes, it is.
And again, we, since
the Environment Department, since the
Drinking Water Bureau really is in
tune to every
water system out there
and issues they might be
having. We always
direct them as a first
stop to the Environment
Department so they can work
with them so that if this
funding source is, is a viable
option for them, we
want to, we want to work for
them, but
we, we,
you know, we, we offer these funds,
you know, to those who are available to
take that on. Sometimes
it doesn't work in terms
of the timing and so forth. But
if they do contact the Environment
department and submit that pre
application and work towards getting
on a fundable list, we can
move expeditiously
at the Finance authority
through our process, our monthly
board process. So
we certainly
understand there are emergencies out
there and other issues that water
systems are facing, we
just direct them to the Environment
department so they can get into the
system and to us
and once they get to us,
we can certainly move
expeditiously through
our process to get the to
get an award out
there.
>> Uh See no more
questions. Oh
um Representative
Terrazas. >> Thank
you madam chair. I I
waive but
probably not, not
like uh Harry
Garcia did the other day or
earlier. Uh
madam chair. Uh
Thank Thank you very much
for your
presentation, sir.
My question here is on
page.
I don't know what page it is. You have
a page number
06 where it
says the loan fund is
over overly committed by
$35 million. And I know
you kinda kinda brushed over
that.
But
can you explain that one more time to
me, please? >> Certainly
madam chair and
representative
because it is because of the
revolving nature of the
fund, this fund
has been around since 1997.
That was the first cap grant that New
Mexico received.
We have
annually repayments
coming in in principle and
interest. We also
have the state match
and the
additional dollars that come in
each year through the federal government
through EPA. So
it's, they look at it as a, as
a holistic. It's the
entire program that
then would be available
to lend out.
So we, we are
able to over allocate
overcommit if you will,
because we know there will be
additional cap grants coming
into the state. We know that
annually we have about 89
million coming back into
the fund through
principal and interest
repayments. And so we're
able to over
allocate which
is what we call binding
commitments, knowing
that it may be a year or two
or a year, let's say before
they actually get to be
dispersing the funds.
So there is some time that's why we
use some cash flow
modeling to try to project
out over the next five
years. What funds will be
available? When
will the bills come due in terms of
the disbursements? So
we do keep a close watch
on that and I hope
that I hope that answers your
question
>> somewhat
madam chair, gentlemen, I
just so
this projection of $35
million is over the next five years. Is that what
I'm understanding? >> The
currently we have
overcommitted the fund by
$35 million.
That is just a current
status. We've
got, you know, about $100
million in tier two funds,
those repayments that I talked about
that have come back into the
fund. So if you take
that plus the cap grants, we
have, we're
$35 million over
that in terms of what's been
committed to
water systems, they've not
closed the loans yet nor
made any disbursements on those
commitments. But we're
just able to do that based on
the revolving nature of the
fund. >> Ok.
I just, I madam chair, the
only reason I asked that is because I
just
uh
private banking is a little bit different.
So I just, I just,
you know what I'm saying,
without me getting into that
deep. And so I just,
my only question to that would
be what if there was an
interruption?
I don't know, we, we're looking at the
economy right
now, we're looking at, you know,
our my opinion.
Uh it's, it's
a little shaky, it looks a little
rough.
Uh And so my
question would be is what happens
if there's an interruption
of your cash flow, these
commitments is
what, what steps would you
have to take to
um meet your
over commitments.
>> Mister Chairman and member,
I would say we would just look at all our
available sources. We
talked about the interest and
and principal payments
coming back in. There's also
interest earned on the fund.
There's other sources within
that tier $2 that
should there be a disruption.
They would have to be fairly
catastrophic. I would think,
you know, we've certainly projected out
over the next one year, two
years, you know, to make sure
that we're, we're at a comfortable
level. So we don't
overpromise by a
a large amount, but we
want to make sure that that's
manageable and
still keep in line with,
with projects moving
forward.
>> Thank you madam chair. I just wanted to
understand that a little bit better. Thank
you so much.
>> Thank you. See, nobody
else. Thank you so much for
this important presentation
and we'll move now
uh to the local
recipients of
NM fa financing
uh Richard Rump, the mayor,
the village of Magdalena
and Angie
Gonzalez, our city
manager in
truth or
consequences.
>> Let's go ahead and hit the button
that has looks like some. There >> you
>> go. >> How is that better?
Uh Mr chairman and committee
members, uh Thank you for inviting
me here today.
Um,
wanted to like to start out
and compliment uh,
uh finance
authority staff
in Santa Fe
and um, pleasure
to work with knowledgeable
and they always have a
solution. Uh,
too many times you run into.
No, we can't do that.
They always look for a
way to help us out.
Um
I've been very
thankful for their input.
Uh Right now we
have uh loans
on fire truck, uh some
equipment.
Um We have some
law enforcement vehicles in the
process. Uh
They've been very proactive, helping
us with these loans.
Uh We're a disadvantaged community
so it's nice to have
the finance authority resource
out there. Uh
My goal is the
mayor is to
make sure the village has the best
equipment,
uh a lot of
years of service on it.
Um We're
looking ahead right now. We
have an emergency
request and
I think you drinking water
for uh replacing
an old deductible
cast iron line that keeps
breaking.
Um We're also
reaching out for
two
grants on uh
preliminary engineering reports
for water and wastewater.
Our system is quite
old. The wastewater
system is the old
clay tile that's starting to
collapse. So
we're looking at getting these done and
then reaching out for
funding
next year and into 26
and
27.
So I say we're trying to be proactive,
solve our problems.
Uh It's nice to have
the finance authority there to
help us out.
Um,
I really don't have
much else to say other than thank
you. Uh,
and, um, helping
our community move
forward.
Uh,
we have a lot of,
uh, plans
in the works. We have,
uh, major improvements
at our airport and street
funding.
Uh,
so I guess that's all I
have.
>> All right, thank you very much. Uh,
let's go to MS
Gonzalez.
>> Good morning, Mr
chair madam, chair
and members of the
committee.
I know it's getting late,
it's getting lunchtime,
but please forgive me. I'm
going to pass this out
while you watch and
look at my waterlines
in Tier C. I'm the city manager in
Tier C. And
so I'm gonna pass this
out
>> and I was
listening.
Oh,
I have to
be
>> ok. Now, when you get your
booklets >> and I'm sorry, before you
continue. If Mayor Rumph can come
back, we're probably going to have some questions for
you after the presentation. So come
on back up if you wouldn't mind, sir. Thank
you.
Ok. Go right ahead
and, and do you want to pass the
waterlines around too or you just want
us to see those? Why not?
Let's take a look at those. If
we can get those to the committee,
please.
>> I apologize. Giant Harvey
hearing. >> No problem,
no problem.
All right, lady, if you
can turn off your sir and if you want to
leave yours on. Thank you,
Mayor if you want to turn your mic off. There
you go. Thank you.
>> All right, Mr
Chair and madam vice
chair and members of the
committee. Now, when you get your
little booklet, I in
intentionally
folded a piece
for you to go right
to because Representative
Kates, you made a
comment that caught my
ear and I
wanted to show
this uh directly
to you. Is this m
this, this MS D this
main street District
Road Surface Improvements
um that was funded by
New Mexico Finance Authority
Colonia.
It was, it was
funded. It was awarded
in January of
2019.
I drove by it this
morning and they are still
working on it.
I wish I was
kidding
that, that and it's
just a teeny tiny
little street. It's a street right
in front, well, not right in front catty
corner from my office
down. And
so it's a
block across
the intersection and another
block,
it is cursed.
It is uh called uh uh
mcadoo Street and
everybody in town is now calling
it Madon Street.
Um I promise when I'm,
when I kick the bucket, I'm
gonna be buried in that
thing because
it is just been
one thing after another
in this street.
Now, um Representative
Kates, I just wanted to let you know,
they had been tried
to um
to award it, of course,
engineering takes time
and then they awarded it three
different times.
The third time we still had
to go back and cut it
up into different
pieces.
But that's not even the
really, you know, woe
is me. The
last summer, we
finally started construction
on this teeny tiny little
project.
We are still working on it. It's
been 14 months later.
We're still working on it.
Now, part of it is my
fault. I
asked for, we finally got
it going. We ran into water
lines, we ran into fiber
lines. We ran into every
single telecommunication
or communication line that you
possibly could
is right there in that
street,
the water table in that
area is about 18
inches low or in 18
inches high, low
something right
there. It's right
there.
I could dig a hole and hit
the water, the water
table and because it's right over
the top of the hot springs,
the the hot springs table,
ok.
We finally get all that
fixed. We finally get
all of the, the, the
telecommunications moved. We
finally get all that stuff
moved
and a movie
shows up and wants
to, wants to
um film their movie
right in the middle of tier
C
I think I cried
and then I probably cursed
because they wanted that
street and in order
for them to stay,
in order for them to film that, that,
that, that movie, the
street had to stay, stay,
stay the same.
So I called my representatives,
I called the people and said,
look, this is what's gonna happen. But I
really, in, in my
heart and my soul, I believe
that the movies, movie industry
in our, in our, our state
is very,
is advantageous to
us. And I really did not
want to kick them
out for
this little tiny,
little tiny, uh,
project.
So, what we did is I
put them on,
I put the contractor on
pause,
told him he has to be
back the end of May.
So we had a movie actually
filmed in, it's called
Eddington, uh
uh
Phoenix,
um
Joaquin Phoenix, Joaquin
Phoenix. Um
Yeah, all kinds of neat stars.
It was, it was really kind of interesting to look
out your window and see people out there
running around doing
movie stuff. It was
neat.
So that was a project.
Then we start up again in
May and of
course, what happens in June,
July and August uh in
New Mexico. Our,
our brain, our, our
rain starts
up. Now
last week we're this
close to finishing it.
We have another waterline
that's in the way that we didn't
even know was there.
So now I have my,
it's, it's my title.
I can force people to do things
that they don't necessarily want to do.
And so I
directed my water
department to go and move
this water
meter
and so that will
be done tomorrow
morning.
And then finally, we can
lay pavement on
that little piece of that
little piece of Downtown
Truth or consequences.
And we will get it into,
we will get the finishing product
in. Well, the finish, I will keep
the finished product. We will get the
paperwork into you guys
and we can finally put a
stop and a
finish bow
on
MS D
Main Street District Road
Services project for
$1.1 million.
That is five years
in the
making.
That's just one thing.
My entire, my,
my, my packet at the very
beginning, it just
really, I know I'm not gonna go
through it. I already took up to a
lot of your time.
Um The water leaks
in our city.
The, but I really wanted you to
see the pictures
of, of our water leaks
and of course, water leaks causes
potholes
and,
and then you know where the, the, the,
the hotspots are at
the water leaks fixed how
much it costs. I don't have to
say anything to anybody
about how expensive it is
to fix uh
uh you
infrastructure.
But I also left at the, toward
the end there, I just really wanted
to show you
um
that New Mexico
Finance Authority as much as we
appreciate everything. And we have
got our little fingers in every
pot of money you guys have,
but we also utilize
USDA. We
utilize um
anybody
II, I was at the point
where I was almost to a point of, of
putting a go fund me
up.
And uh
and so I just really wanted to give
you this kind of information
to review
and, and, and then at the very
end of it, there's a huge piece
of paper that's, that
is
um
folded in half
and it'll show you that throughout
all the different funds,
all the different projects that we
have that are funded
$71.4
million throw it flowing
through our, our little, our
little city
and,
and it's not just infrastructure
that you help us
with. You also
have helped us
uh purchase a, a,
an a not abandoned
but a you an
old building, an old bank
building that I'm gonna move
my, my police department
into. Um, you
have helped us, you've
helped with the hospital, you've
helped you,
your funding is so
important to these
communities, to
the size of Magdalena,
to the size of Tier
C to the size of
Socorro and we
just
with your AAA bonding
and we just couldn't,
we couldn't do what we do without
your help. And I just really
want to make that very, very, very
clear.
I stand for any
questions.
>> Ok. Thank you very much
for your presentations,
Senator
Gallegos.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and thank
you. I
wanted to go back to
some of the discussion. You had
tier C about your
five years.
And did you see?
So I do utilities
and
during COVID
costs
really, really increased
doubled,
did that hurt?
I guess with limited
amounts of money
that would be part of
this delay. You say
that's true, >> Mr
Chair
Senator. He goes, yes, sir.
Yes, absolutely. That,
that was, it
is.
I think before COVID, you would
see that you had,
you know, a little bit of an
over
estimate, you know, the engineer's
estimate. And then of course, you know what
the, what the contractor would come in.
You would have a little bit. But
I mean, I, and
that, that, that document,
that you'll look at what
it says here is, it says, OK, the
funding source, but
then it says our funding, our
amount was $1.1 million.
I'm back on that cursed
Street. OK.
900,000 of it. All right.
That, that breaks down that little
piece of it down
here. Here it
is. The original
bid was in December of
2022. So of course,
everything 2020
2021
was on pause.
But in the original bid scope,
there was no bids even
received.
Ok? Then they reduced
the scope, Rebid it
in January of
23
is
1.1
and then they reduced it
again
to and, and that's when I showed
up into your seat was the
April 2023.
That's, that's when
I, I
was fortunate enough to be able to
become part of this community.
And uh so then you can
see, yeah, that's, it's
exactly it. And, and not
only the cost
but the supply
chain, we are still
waiting on some of these other chain,
some of these other um
projects, we are
still over 52
weeks waiting on an electric
component for
our,
you you
utility guy, a scat a system
for the water
utilities.
We're still waiting on that.
And so, and, and,
and I'm loud and
obnoxious and grumpy
and I get on to people.
I can't imagine what these
smaller communities
have to deal with
as they,
as they have part
time,
part time staff
and, and, and stuff. Like
it's just
19 through
now. I think we're finally starting
to move it out. But, I mean, yeah,
19 now it's,
it's been a struggle.
>> Thank you for that.
And
I guess my next question
is on
your
bidding process are using
CE S. I've worked
with Wilson company
before, so
I understand they do a great
job uh on
the engineering side.
But I'm wondering on your procurement
process, are
you going out to
RFP or you doing CE
how are you getting your
contractors?
>> Mr Chair, Senator
Gago,
we are going through with
these, we are going through
the, the, the RP
process as
to get the um
the best price.
Um We
do u utilize
CE S quite a bit. We
utilize um
HG AC quite
a bit. We
utilize, I guess HG
AC is technically a more
of a um capital,
you know, for our trucks and stuff
like that. Um
source. Well,
we've really, yeah,
we've really,
we'll just use anything we can do
to get our, our bids
into contractors hands
and eyes and
hopefully get their, their
wallets or get
their, their bid documents
open so that we can get these projects
done. >> Thank you for
that Mr Chair and I
know that Senator Brantley
has done a lot trying to
highlight the area and the
issues.
My last question is,
what is your economic
driver. I, I would assume
it's tourism.
But I know going
backwards during
Governor Martinez
time, she asked
me to find
ambulances
for T or C. And
at that time, we donated
two from Lovington
to T or C because of
the, there's
a, I wouldn't
say it was an algae issue
back probably
1617,
somewhere in there that
even at that point in time, you
guys didn't have the
capabilities of just
ambulance service.
And it's sort of
my fear
is that
if
we don't do something to help
you, and it's only going to
deteriorate more. But I'm
wondering what would
be your maz main driver
and community for
tax
>> Mr Chair,
Senator VGOs.
Um You stepped
on something that I, I was meant
to sit down and just
say is how
appreciative we are
of Senator Brantley. She
is just
a, she
is just a,
a
advocate for our
community and, and we
literally could not
have functioned without
her. We
talk about an, an
aggressive advocate
for our community and we, we just
couldn't do it without her. And so we
appreciate her very, very
much. Um Also I was gonna,
when I was gonna originally sat down
but uh Representative Kate's got
my brain going. I wanted
to also say, uh a
shout out to
uh my, I shouldn't
say the word old but my ex
representative, uh representative
Chatfield when, whenever I lived
up in the north, but I
moved from the north because I was
tired of it snowing in September
and in May. So
I went south
and so uh
Senator Guy goes
the yes,
Elephant Butte Tier
C Williamsburg
are very much on
the uh the tourism.
Um,
the tourism dim, of
course, you know, during
uh labor
during Memorial
Day,
Fourth of July and,
and, and Labor Day,
we have, we have
over 100,000 people
out at that
lake.
They need beer.
They need to go in and take a
shower. They need to go in
and do things. I mean, they need
new bologna and cheese. You know, I don't
know what or steaks, I don't know what they
need. Uh, they need all
kinds of neat stuff in there. And so
they come into the community
and, and they spend,
and they look around and
we love it that they're downtown
and they're, they're,
uh, checking
out our galleries
and our, um,
coffee shops and our
little, our little,
our little
restaurants and, and
from being from moving
in, I have to
say this as sincerely as I
possibly can. I have
never seen a
community
that
takes care of their
selves.
By
lunchtime, you can't
get into a restaurant at
lunchtime over there.
You have to take
your lunches at certain times or you're
not gonna get back to work at a, at a
regular time. I, I'm
so, I, I've, I've said this to
many, many people. I've never seen a
community that
takes care of their own
small businesses
so well as,
as truth or consequences does.
It's, it's
heartwarming to see them taking
care of their, of themselves.
>> Well, thank you for that. We'll keep you in prayer,
Mr Chair. Just closing. I
would say that your
legislator, your
senator is tenacious
when I met her, I
635
nows, not
me down the size, but thank
you for your answers. Thank you. We'll
be >> all
right. Thank you very much, Senator and
now to the super sensation,
Senator Brantley. Well,
thank >> you. Thank you
all, Mr
Chairman. There's, there's some
of the pipeline T or C pipe water
lines going around and it really is
amazing to actually see that.
I've been saying this for a number of years
but truth or
consequences because of these
water leaks have made national
headlines. We've had MS
NBC. We've had NBC
doing stories on this
because we're leaking over 200
million dollars, a million
acre feet of water annually.
So it's flooding the
streets of Tier C
at any given time. As
she mentioned, we had Joaquin
Phoenix and Emma Stone
out of water when we're trying
to promote ourselves
as a rule movie
set. That's not,
that's not as stressful as
having to shut down. This happens
quite frequently with
young kids in schools. We've shut
down our schools a number of times
where we'll get a text that say the towns
because of waterly is out
of water and parents have to go pick
up their kids. The
hospital has had to actually
invest in some, some
major water storage
facilities because they could
not risk being mid
surgery and running out
of water in the crisis
that has we have
on any given holiday weekend.
She says our population jumped
to over 100,000
people and we just can't manage
the number of visitors coming in.
And most important
Representative Garcia,
we were home to the, the new
Mexico veterans home
there. And when they're out of
water, it's a, it's a
public safety crisis
that starts happening
within our community.
And the reality is as hard as we
fought for water. Um,
and I want to thank the governor's office
who came in, Representative
Armstrong
and Jaramillo and I teamed up,
came up about 3 million
of our capital. Uh, last,
last year, the governor, uh
contributed a little bit to
that to help us. Really,
the biggest advocate has been
when I pleaded my case to
Secretary Kinney of the
Environment Department to say
this isn't just a public
safety and economic development
concern. This is an
environmental concern because the
amount of water that's leaking out
and going to waste. And he has been a
bulldog. He has personally come
down to CRC and I just
want to go on the record. I think you would agree
with me that I appreciate
him in finding
ways to just get the money out
there, we've talked about how fresh
it is because as a
legislative body, we
allocate funds and we drive by
projects and it could be two or three
years later and they're just breaking
ground on the case
here. Every drop that's
leaking out on the like water
is, is money and this
water is going to waste. And he's
come in here. We've talked about
how we can declare
emergencies to
expedite our
spending. And the
legislator Magdalena, I'm
sure you would relate to that when a
city is completely
out of water
and they are trucking
water to their residents,
somehow that needs to be
prioritized to,
to the bridge in Elephant Butte,
right? I mean, we can divert traffic
but we actually have
constituents that are out of water
and it's really been a, been a crisis
on there. Um I just want to
publicly thank Secretary Kinney.
I want to thank TRC for the work.
We have a long ways to go. We have
about 100 and 20 million worth
of infrastructure
that we still need to, to
um replaced. And I
guess as a legislative body
when I sit here as a new legislator,
I think, gosh, how in the world did we
get to this? How are we replacing
wooden pipelines
and, and not just this community,
but many rural
communities is there seems to
be responsibility on us and
then to say there's a lifespan,
this new infrastructure that
we in a wealthy
legislator are putting in today.
How do we make sure that in
50 you know,
6070 years
that we have the resources
that we are somehow saving to
replace, constantly,
replace aging infrastructure
in New Mexico so that we
don't see ourselves coming in
here and quite frankly
dealing with failed leadership
for many decades. A
before. How
do we make sure that we are preparing
for switching out this infrastructure
as we move forward? It's hard to
think that far because at this point, we're just
trying to catch up for the years
that we haven't done it, but
I appreciate your time. I appreciate
you sharing the story that we're all
struggling with. Thank you. Thank you, Mr
>> Chair. All right. Thank you,
Senator Representative
Kates.
>> Thank you, Chair and thank you very
much for your presentation.
I thank you for all the
detail. I mean,
just the work
that you put into this presentation
is very impressive
and, and I like a
good show and tell and
so that Pat pipe
is um terrifying.
So, thank you.
Um I
want to II, I
understand that
leadership in
TRC may
understand that there's
opportune economic
opportunity to hold
off on a project
and, and be able to
reap the benefits of bringing
the film industry
into uh the
for a while. What
I'm concerned about
is why are
there water pipes
we don't know about?
Um, that is a
deep concern for me. I
am very grateful
that you have stayed
in New Mexico. It's one of the
beautiful things about our state. It
doesn't matter if you want snow or
not. We have a space
for you here, rural or
urban.
And um
but I do
think that as we
are taking this opportunity
to invest
in the infrastructure
and water being
the most important part
of that investment
um that we
are, we
are,
I don't know, mapping
building
sites so that we
understand what is buried.
That is what concerns
me the most.
I wanted to ask
you, do you feel that
TRC has a
special
difficulty
with the water infrastructure?
Given the
spectacular and
magical things about the
water in
Trc?
>> Mr Chair,
Representative Kate's? I
believe
that and I've
told this story to my
elected officials and as
you can tell, I'm a storyteller,
so be careful.
Um I told them, I said,
ladies and gentlemen, what
would you do if I
walked in just 10
years ago? I
went to a commission meeting
and I said, you
know what Mr Mayor, Mayor
pro TEM
commissioners,
I think,
I think we need to start
looking at our
infrastructure.
And I think, you know what if you guys would
give me and this was of course, let's just say,
10 years ago, I say, yeah, you know what, you
give me a couple of million dollars and I'll see
what I can do about, you know,
prioritizing our
infrastructure and seeing where we
need to do. They would
have
rightfully so put
me in a
rubber room,
nothing's wrong.
Nothing's leaking
down the streets. There's nothing
wrong.
That's just human nature. That's
not III
I don't like
blaming somebody
because we only know what we
know when we know it.
And so I,
I, yes, you're right. There are,
everybody knows there's a life cycle, there's
a life cycle to us. There's a life cycle
to the economy. There's a life cycle for
every single thing. We should
know that there was a life cycle to
these waterlines.
Um whenever Tier C
was first incorporated,
uh more than likely there was
not much of a planner.
And so you're right there.
The, the waterlines
kink cross this way and
they go zigzag that way
and this, that and the other. And so that's whenever
you're running into these different
waterlines that people
did know where they were at
but has since
retired
and that,
that, that institutional
knowledge went with them.
We are now
putting now, of course,
with the, the, the wonderful
um technology that we have,
we are now
pinpointing
and
uh have a full GIS
system as
of, of the water system
that we've been able to work with
uh with our engineers with,
um, and I don't mean to
advertise for this. I'm just,
just, this was just a
presentation that I had. So
I don't mean to be present to
be advertising.
But what I do is what
we, we, we have that relationship
with them where we do have,
uh, the GIS system, we
have people who are trained to be
able to, um, take
care of. Oh, we
found, we found a water
line just a few
weeks ago. They found a, a
water
valve, a water valve
that they didn't even know existed. So
they were able to, what is it? Drop
a pin, drop the P
I'm really not that old. I should know
better um drop
the pin. And so it was able
to be added to the,
to the GIS map.
And so they were, it, we're
working on that because
my water, my
water director and
myself do
not want to leave the city
in the same
place that we found it.
And so we're really trying to push
it up and make sure that we have
maps and we have knowledge and we
have information.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and
thank you very much. That's what
I appreciate. I see
all these projects that get done.
I like to hear that. I hope
that we see some GIS
mapping that is on
these projects that need
to be funded to
make sure that we have long term
investments.
I agree with the
senator that this has been
national news. I've had
constituents where
in my district who are
very much concerned about
all the leaking.
Um, you know, the,
it affects the entire
state
since water
is the most important thing
in our state and
the management of the
water that
we are sending for our
compact. When
we hear that it
is being
that it's leaking through
faulty infrastructure, it
becomes very panic
stricken for my farmers up
north who
are on a
very strict
uh
supply. And
so thank you, I love to
hear that that you're investing
more in the G I si
have one just
suggestion and, and
is that these
larger projects in the
smaller communities that I've
worked with? One of the
strategies that they've
used that I've been very
impressed with is that
they are buying their
supplies
almost all at
the same time and
securing it in the
area in which they're
building and
then they're breaking ground
so that they really know
what the budget
is. It's
not,
it's, and so
having strong project
managers to
be able to do that, it's
a way for them to actually
know what the budget is, control
the cost and the
timeline because
they've actually
gathered the
materials
in one place. And so
I, I make
that humble suggestion and
thank you, Mr Chair.
>> All right. Thank you very much, Representative
Representative Roybal
Caballero.
>> Thank you Mr Chair.
And I agree
with everything that my colleague
just stated and her
recommendation is,
is a wise one at
that also has
worked in
my previous
work as uh economic
developer for
Sibila County.
One of the things that
um
way back when I was
there um that
I found out I you learn a lot
of things when you're in these positions.
As you just
indicated,
the sitting,
the water that leaks
and it stays
sitting for
a while,
raises a red
flag. Also from
the standpoint of a public
health concern because
sitting water
attracts
mosquitoes,
attracts uh
fungi,
all kinds
of other things has
the I have several
questions but first one
has the environmental
department or anyone
else um
brought this concern
up and helped
you to address how you might
mitigate that. Thank
you, >> Mr
Chair Representative
Capo. We
are uh we
actively uh spray
for vectors.
We have a a vector spraying
program.
Uh
It, it originates out of the
city and then we also
go out into the county.
So we, we try
to kill them
>> that uh Thank you
Mr Chair. That is
absolutely um
the correct thing to do. And
thank you for doing that because
when I saw the photo,
it brought back memory,
I had flashbacks
of the sitting water,
collecting all kinds of algae
and bad algae and
in up northwest. Um
Thank you for that. So,
and, and I
also want to talk uh thank
the, the senator
for um
all of her
uh
advocacy and
whatever it's taken
to highlight uh for
her ability to highlight
this to us.
Um The other
question that I
have is,
have you been able to
identify?
I, I know that we've had
a number of these committee
reports, a number of reports
that come from our smaller communities,
which is really helpful
when we hear directly
from you where the
bottlenecks are
in the process. I'm
looking at the folded
copy you gave and then some
of the other timelines
where, where does the
bottleneck occur?
Does it occur
in the bidding process
in the procedures perhaps
that are there
um with just a
bureaucracy of D
FA or
are you able to pinpoint
where the major bottlenecks
are? Because that would
be extremely helpful to
us in being able
to address
our concerns through the
administrative
channels,
>> Mr Chair madam
representative? Oh,
would you just left that
teed up for me to go after,
to go after the bureaucracy.
And
my, my, my,
my little soul just
says
sincerely and I
think just by just a
little bit, I think you're gonna know I'm
gonna shoot you straight. Ok. I think
you're, I think you're gonna get
that.
I would love to say it's
bureaucracy
but it's not,
it really was in
this particular
thing. It really was the
lack of contractors able
to get out there. Now, on
their side of it, it may be bureaucracy
on their side of it. It
very well may be, but
I, I'm not aware of that. I, I
don't know their side of
it on our
side
and, and see I come from
an area that is
remote.
So when I'm in Tier C,
I'm thinking, you know what, you're
80 miles from Cruces,
you're 100
and 100
and 2500 and 50 miles from,
from Albuquerque.
But when there's so much going
on in Albuquerque. There's so much
going in Los Luas, there's
so much going on in Belan and,
and, and Santa
Fe. Why
would I take my company
to Tier C
and, and, and, and
do the mobilization uh do
the uh mileage
per diem for my employees when
I can get for a
$1.1 million
water or
street project when
I can probably go
into
rule
and for, to, to those of
us, you know, rule
uh Bernalillo County and I
can probably get a $2 million
project.
I mean, I'm just, I'm just
saying, I, I just,
to me, that's just logical.
I why would I go to Tier C
and do this when I can
get at least, or
even, even 1 $1
million and just be
at home at night,
sleeping in my own
bed. That's
what I'm thinking, ma'am.
>> So thank you and thank you
for, thank
you for that. That's very important to
know because we also have
suggestions whereby
you can go ahead and tap
into.
Um I would say
the nontraditional
pathways
of um
seeking
contractors
for the, for the various
different types of
um work
that you need to undertake. And I
would suggest that
um I would suggest
just offer one
suggestion and that would be
our trade unions,
our unions,
labor unions,
they specialize
many of them in this,
in this area, in
these areas because there
are multiple, there are
multiple areas
that
are required
to undertake these
projects and
they also work not
just with the big contractors but
the small contractors
and it's the small
contractors, Mr Chair
historically that
have lost out
on um bidding
processes or other things.
And they have the same
capacity as the
larger. But because of what you
just described,
um, you know, they
have those different
circumstances are more appealing,
but when it's just
a smaller contractor,
I think you, you will
find a lot more
receptiveness. So it's just
a suggestion that that might
be helpful, just tapping in
to see if they have
additional resources
available to you. And thank
you for your work and for your patience
and for your dedication
to our communities.
This TRC
I was raised in El Paso Las
Cruces area and TRC
was always our, our
affordable because
we were poor
daytime
trips or whatever and we've
always enjoyed it. Thank you very
much, Mr
Chair.
>> Ok. Thank you, Representative Representative
Terrazas,
Luis M
Terrazas.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
>> Terrazas >> M
Terrazas is now ready. All
right, Mr
Chair real quick. Uh I
wanted to ask the uh
the mayor just expand a little
bit, please. Um
on, I know you ran
out of water and I don't
know how long ago it was
and just so I can
bottle up quick so we
can move. How long,
how long were you out of water?
And what have you
guys done to resolve
that issue? And
for it not to happen
again.
>> Um That goes some years
back. Uh
Unfortunately, that
was, uh, I
think an employee error that
caused that it took us a couple
of weeks. I was not the
mayor at that time.
Um,
the village and not
maintain their two backup
wells.
Um, they used
up their money at that time to do
that. We have
three water wells functioning.
Uh We drilled a new one
last year. Uh
We're finally gonna
get that. I have a
contract meeting
next week with the new
contractor to get
that well hooked into the system.
So we'll have four operational
wells. The new
well came in about 200
gallons a minute, which
is pretty awesome.
Uh Nice clear water.
Uh So that project
is moving ahead. Um
Now that I understand what
you are looking for an
information, uh We
have the Benjamin well, on the west
side of town, uh we're
looking at putting a stor
additional storage tank. I
have the money for that.
Uh putting a booster
pump pumping into a
tank. Uh That'll
help with our contact
time with the water
with the chlorine. Uh
Give us additional
backup uh water
supply. Uh
We're
um going
to request as
everybody knows, cost of doing
business. Uh We're
requesting the next legislators
for 1.2 million to add
that a million dollars. We have
to make that project happen.
Uh That will give us additional
uh water storage.
We're also looking at
uh a
generator that can
function on the different wells in
our booster tank.
Uh We were without
power at one point for
52 hours
uh car electric
and uh
uh everybody involved
jumped right in and got us
back uh in
service. So the water
um very
proactive and watching
that um
mentioned their T
or C problems with uh
mapping and stuff.
Uh We just had a
company put in fiber
optic. Uh We
found a lot of things
that weren't there. Uh
We have maps
that are not accurate.
Uh The one water line
show down the middle of the street
was actually clear up
against the fence line. The
contractor hit it with his
boring machine.
Other issues we've had,
they repave streets,
they buried the shut off
valves. Uh
So we had to dig down and find a
shut off valve. That area. A
lot of things were done in the past
with no oversight
and where we have a lot
of issues that
TC is uh
going through.
Um
soon as the Trujillo
Well is online, that'll
give us a very good
backup for our system.
Uh I'm
looking in the future to
continue
upgrades. I mentioned
uh doing a study on our water
lines. Um
We have old ductible
cast iron, we have steel
and PV C
going to the
uh we're water conference
talking to other engineering
firms. Their
consensus is to start
on one side of town, rip it all
up and start
over. Uh
We're running into the old
uh cast iron lines are
breaking
and um, so
we're trying to not have
a water crisis in the
future. Uh
So I guess
that does that
answer?
>> Yes, sir, Mr Mayor. That does. Thank you,
Mr Chair.
Uh Mr Mayor. Thank you very
much. I, I think,
you know, all of us
recognize that
uh uh water
is probably the new goal,
right? Um Especially
in New Mexico, we don't have any
water. And
uh um I
think that resource is very,
very, very, very
important.
And um but
what I was gonna tell you is, you
know what the story that you
guys are kind of sharing is happening
all over New Mexico.
It's happening all over New Mexico,
even in my own district.
Part of, I used to have a part of Sierra
County and I got redistricted
into Hidalgo and
Kathryn. But,
uh you
know, we
heard water projects all over
the state with similar
stories and part of
it is, you know, we didn't,
you know, some of the stuff was just,
hey, let's wanna
run,
run a water line in
certain directions. Let's just
type it in, let's just get it going
and no one ever went back to
survey those things or
whatever. Uh And you
have that because that's just the way things were
done many years ago. But
that tells you the age of our, of
our infrastructure.
We, I myself
in my district in Grant County
have a, a little place
called Hanover
and those people just
recently, they've been out
of water several times over the
last couple of months. Last
time was three days.
That's tremendous.
And no one contacted
us to the last day.
Uh, so, you know,
then we're running around trying to get
water trucks and so forth.
Right. So that they can at least,
uh, get water to their, to
their animals and,
and sending out water
bottles. So just people have,
you know, water to hydrate
themselves.
But, you know, we
have problems like
this all over to Mexico
and I think the
legislature and the executive
branch has to turn
around and
make
what a priority.
Um And I know that we have done
that to a certain, you
know, extent, but,
you know, we have also some,
some speed
bumps or some walls that
we got to deal with. Some
of those are, you know,
um I have,
I'll use Hanover as an
example. Hanover
has 100 and
$10,000 worth of capital
outlay. They have
another $100,000 of federal
funding. They have another
$5000
loan loan from
the federal government can't
use any of it because
uh the executive word that
we have standing mandates that
you have to have all your audits in
order. So
you have many municipalities
around the, around the
state that are finding
themselves in that same situation
where, um,
you know, they
don't have their audits in
order and,
you know, you've got rule little, these
little political
subdivisions, these are,
you know, that have
work
for a long time, probably not
doing what exactly what they were supposed
to do. And I see the, the,
the reason that we should
have, uh, our
audits in order. Absolutely.
But we also have to
sometimes recognize that
there are certain
situations,
water in particular
that when a community like
Hanover Magdalena,
you know, uh, to truth or
consequences have a
problem with water
that we need to maybe make some
exceptions. Maybe
we need to, you know, say, hey, you know
what, we've got this situation
this, you know, that,
that, uh,
um, small domestic
is, got it seven years
in arrears
for, um,
their audits at
the same time.
Uh Mr Chair,
uh, and committee.
We, we're having, we're
struggling to keep
our accountants
and so you can't find accountants to
come over here and just step in, in
line and just say, hey, you know, I want
to order an audit, especially
when you gotta go seven years back. I'm gonna account
myself. And so
many of these accountants, uh,
accounting firms
are shrinking
in size. They,
they, they, they, we have a lack
of accountants period going
throughout the, the
country. So many of
these accountants are going to work for bigger
firms. They're going to work for,
uh, corporations and they're
all of a sudden your
little CPA firm
downtown who used to be able
to hire these accountants
out of the university or whatever
they're being taken
and these bigger corporations
are giving them really
good dollars to
leave and come work for them because they
found themselves that they have
a shortage. So
I think we're caught in this,
this, you know, this,
I don't know, this whirlpool of
the lack of, of, of
accountants that
need to have, uh, in,
in the, these small
domestics or uh
uh these
uh political subdivisions,
whatever that don't
have their,
um, their audits in
order, which in turn, they can't
use their capital outlay.
In turn, we've got all these
situations that we can't fix.
So it's just sitting there, we've got a pot of
money that we can't touch.
So it's just, I just wanted to say
that to make my colleagues
aware. Uh and I'm
sure they have similar stories,
but thank you very much for your
presentation.
>> OK. Thank you very much.
Representative. Any other comments,
questions, thoughts,
feelings, emotions? OK.
Well, I have a few
just, just to
wrap up a few.
So,
so and, and mayor
and, and,
and
let's see here, city manager,
excuse me. So I
heard you loud and clear. Is there
also a workforce issue
for you to get this work done?
You have to juggle a
gigantic project, whether
it's a, you know, a $5000
project or a one or two
or $5 million project.
How's the workforce treating
you to get this, these projects
completed?
>> Uh Mr Chair,
our workforce
is
lacking
and for, for all the reasons
that Representative Torazo
said
is
nobody wants to come back to these
small towns unless
they're ready to raise their families. And
then it's, you always want to go home
to raise your family.
Um, our
city, our
city water department.
Well, our city water
department is always
looking for, uh, we
cannot get, um,
certified
nmnmed,
certified people.
And so we have to work
them as,
um, as Oper
not operators, we work
them as general
laborers until
they get their. Now, this
is where some of
what Representative Caba
Creo had
said is some of this,
of the, of the
bureaucracy
is uh for
the water department, they have to
get their water one
and then they have to wait a year
to get their water
too
and then they have to wait another
year to get their water three.
So those are also
and I understand why
I'm not, I'm not, I'm just stating
facts. OK. I'm not stating
passionately, I'm just stating facts
here. So
we have so
from within ourselves,
we are, we are
trying to build our own
water department from
local people who want to
stay in the community,
who want to live
there, who want to be part
of and, and, and
become um
certified operators
of their,
of their infrastructure,
whether it be water,
wastewater
and Tier C can throw
another knot into it. We
have our own electric
department.
So
>> mayor, did you have a
comment?
>> Uh We
face same issues uh
with, uh, getting
water masters getting right
now. It's getting test.
It takes forever to get a test
lined up.
Um, I've been very
frustrated, different water
meetings. I've talked to the
agencies about it
uh
to rewrite the
test.
Level one had questions
for level two or
three.
It skews,
uh, the operators study
for a certain test.
Uh So that's been
one of our issues to,
to get people trained in test.
I have uh, uh water
one level and we have a contract
with, uh, uh,
water two and
three, to
oversee our operations.
Uh Today,
I'm gonna try to hire 1/5 member
for our utility crew.
Uh I'm
not very optimistic. Uh
People don't want to work
anymore. Uh We
lost one of our restaurants in town
because they couldn't get enough employees.
So getting work for us
together
on the large level,
all the major contractors,
they're constantly trying to
hire, uh,
people.
Um,
they've got tons of work out
there but can't get enough workforce
to do it. Uh, people
don't, I mean, these are good paying
jobs too,
uh, you know, utility
workers and things like that.
Um,
so workforce is
kind of an issue.
So,
>> and, uh, do, do
you thank you for your comments, both of
you and this is,
you know, exactly the reason why we
wanted to have folks like yourself present
to this committee because this
is great information for all of us to
hear for the work that we, we all
serve on multiple committees
and that this is perfect for what
we wanted to hear from you. Um
Do you camp on to
statewide pricing agreements
when you're doing these types of projects
or do you typically go
and RFP them
yourselves or how do you
obtain uh a
contract to get these, this
work done? I'm
a business owner myself and I have to
jump through hoops that some
sometimes feel like they're on
fire and
sometimes they burn you. They really
do because it takes so long
to. But do you camp
on to statewide pricing agreements to
get some of your work done,
>> Mr Chair? We
do that when
we can.
Um
I, I'm trying to
say,
I,
I don't think that we could
afford to do
a, I mean, if, when
you do get a chance to look at this, you're gonna
see that there is a $9
million USDA
loan. Ok. Or of
funding loan
grant, blah, blah, blah.
Ok.
For us to do that
through a ce S
contractor. Boy, would
he love us? So,
so would ce
s
this is my opinion.
I
I would be reluctant to
go through CE S on something that
big
because of the
looks,
forgive me
because then to me
and II I can be talked
out of this but this is my
opinion.
I'm gonna give it
to my, I'm gonna give it
to my
contractor
when the RFP
process, the, the procurement
code,
right, in my opinion for
rightfully so
makes us go out for bid.
It takes some time. Yes, it
takes time to get the specs, it takes time
to do all that stuff. But it makes
us go out to bid. We advertise
in the journal, we advertise in the Sun
News, we advertise in the local
newspaper wherever that may be
throughout the state, your
local newspaper,
the Sierra
Sentinel and we
advertise for those.
And that lets
Joe's construction
know about it that lets
all the way from Joe's construction
to the
big ones come
in.
I'm a fair market person.
And so to me
that's
the fair market.
Um I
think, and I don't remember
who it was. I don't know, maybe
it was Senator Geos had
said that said the same
thing and I do see where if
you've already gone out for a couple of
times go to the CE S,
get the project going bury
this money. You guys said it,
bury this darn money. Let's
get it rocking. And that's
what I agree with. And so I think in
my head, I'm sitting back here listening to
you guys and I think that's
what I'm going to do as we get
all this that we have been
appropriated. You know, we
go out for the bids.
If we don't get
anything,
then we go through the
different price
agreements and III I
don't disagree with that a
bit, but, and that was my
opinion.
>> Thank you. Mayor. Did you have a
comment?
>> Uh I,
I try to use price
agreements whenever I can, especially
purchasing for fire
departments. We just recently took
over a county fire station.
We've been covering that area for the
last two years anyhow. But
now we officially have a
second fire station.
Uh I use price agreements
where I can
uh to
get the jobs going and get
things done.
Um
I'm right now, I've
requested some bids for
projects. It's been eight weeks,
no response.
So we went with another
contractor.
I have uh bids
in for generators on four
buildings. Uh We
have the money sitting there, the
contractor to bid the project
doesn't return my phone
calls. So
I guess they have more work to know what to
do with uh for T or
C. I'm sure it's the same thing we
have uh some
of the contractors are nice. They
tell you upfront
it's not enough money and
you're too far from Albuquerque
and they won't even bid on a
project. Uh One
contractor was trying to
find a smaller
company to do it. I've never heard
back from them. So,
uh but I try to use
price agreements when I can
to facilitate purchasing.
So,
>> thank you. So I
do suggest that
you maybe even
in your municipal league
meetings or when you're together
with all of your colleagues that
you talk about, maybe doing
something along the lines of
developing clear,
clearly defined statewide pricing
agreements that all of you
can, you know, participate
in and all that kind of stuff because
it seems like it will get projects moving
a little bit faster just
like you just like my business.
Anyone else that's a business owner in this
room and has to meet a payroll
and, and, and, and have cost
for your business. It is
incredible how everything has
increased over the, since the pandemic
and what have you and, and leading up
to it. But if you
look at, at
the CP I the consumer price
index, it says that inflation has
increased depending on where you are
in the country, 19
to 29% in the
past 36
or so months.
My question to you
is why do we hear that
projects have increased, have
doubled and tripled in size
and what have you when the actual
number is somewhere between
still a huge number but
19 and 20%.
Do you care to comment on that
at
all?
Is it your location? Is
that what causes the dramatic
increase and, and, and push
the button if you could? So we can hear
you? >> I'm
sorry,
couldn't quite hear everything you said,
but um
our location is against
us. It's, it's hard to get
people to respond, hard to
get uh work
done.
Um
I try to do what I can
and to stay within the
procurement code.
Um
Sometimes
there's a person there that's qualified
to do it,
sort of
do that. But it, it's hard,
it's hard on us to
get uh
get quotes, get people to show
up. There are some companies now
that are expanding
into the Corollary
electricians and heating
air conditioning because
the demand is so high and
the local people
are not
responding. So
we reach out to as
many folks as we
can.
>> Thank you madam city manager.
You have a
comment,
>> Mr Chair, as you can see, I was.
Thank you very,
very tightly on what you
said. No,
they don't, they don't, >> don't add up
to me. That's why everything should only
where we go in the state. I'm asking
people >> about this. So everything should be
be a 25%
more.
And that's making sense and that's
what, that's what my brain
going. And
so
I wonder,
I wonder,
um, I think, I think
that maybe due
to our
rural is
that I don't want to leave
Albuquerque. I don't want to leave Las
Cruces. I don't want to leave El
Paso.
Um,
maybe I, I don't
know. >> Well, I
encourage you and your colleagues when
you, again, when you get together with the municipal
league and what have you, that you have this
conversation? I, I'm
bringing it up everywhere I can because I
think it's really important.
Um, if there's
price gouging going on, that's one
thing that, that, that's
something that, you know, you have ways
to overcome that.
You know, the other thing
is,
yeah, I mean, if you have a, I
keep harping on this one too.
If you have a statewide pricing
agreement, there's no, none of this
ridiculous, you
know, within three years doubling
the cost of a project for
you because that's just not happening.
It's not happening. With wages
they're going up, but it's not, they're not
being doubled by any means
and supplies are not going up
twice or double
or, or triple. So that's
why I'm trying to get my hands around. Why do we
continually hear?
And we have quotes for public
schools at $1000 a
square foot. Now, by the way, I
don't know, I serve on that committee as well.
Can you believe that? And
that's just amazing.
So last
two questions that I had for you
is do you report,
you know the, the, the shape
of that waterline
slice that you showed us? Do
you report that to a centralized
water repository database
of any kind? I can't imagine
you're the only ones
facing that type of
a water quality
issue
>> mister chair.
The, regardless
of what those lines look like the
quality of tc's water
is, it
gets reported
every
and forgive me, I don't know
exactly how often we have
a AAA person
who does all of that. Uh
She makes sure that all the
reports are in and everything like
that that are reported
to NMED. She
makes sure that everything and we
have clear clean
water regardless of what those
look like, we have clean
water. Um I, I
was teasing some of the women
that I came up in the elevator
with for, for us, for us,
women of a certain age, it's really good
for our mineral intake.
And so, um
but No, our water
is
and so our water is
clean and it
is
appropriate. It's gone
through the nmed checks.
And so we are, we are
good. >> Well,
that's really great to hear.
Um, you know, I lived in T or C as
a child over three different
summers and I
loved it. Absolutely loved it. I love to
go there for vacationing and whenever
we can get away and just have like a little
relaxation time. So
thank you for everything that you're doing there.
The last comment that I had,
uh and then we'll wrap up here
is I think Representative Arbel
Caballero brought this up too and that's
along the lines of the last
question. Um
Are you depositing
information into
a community health database
of any kind at the statewide
level? Or is anybody tracking
like trends? Because
even if it's just a
small
decrease in water quality
as a result of what you just showed
us, you know,
you do that over a 10 year period
and that's pretty significant.
But are you reporting that anywhere or
is that being logged anywhere for
you,
>> Mr Chair? You
got me. I don't
know.
Um
>> because if it were my community
and I know that Senator Branley is working
her rear end of trying to get all of this
squared away for you. And I'm very
supportive of her work as well.
I would be sirens blaring if
I had, if I saw what I
just saw you know,
I'm, I'm just very concerned for
you. So what are you doing with the
data? Because that's really what helps you
to tell that
story.
>> I would think
that
our medical professionals
as they are seeing
patients, that
they are,
that they are, I, I know
that they have to do
certain
uh reports also to
doh
and to whoever else they answer
to.
But honestly, I've never,
I've never touched into that.
I, you guys have
given me quite a lot of homework
to go home with. Um I'm
not exactly sure.
Um I have
the
hospital CEO
and that will be a phone call that I make
and just ask this, this question
is, is where is
these, where are
these uh
trends and
the is that
water
negatively, in fact
impacting our,
our, our, our
citizenship, our, our
people and,
and of course, that's absolutely
not. We
know that we are
providing
clean,
appropriate water
to the uh to the
citizens.
But it does
stand
to reason
that once it goes through those
pipes,
I, I'm gonna ask that question and I
apologize that I don't know it. I
apologize,
>> Mr
Mayor
>> uh Mr Chairman,
uh the protocols
for Magdaleno. Uh
We do
uh sampling
every month uh various
locations. It's set up by the
environmental department.
Uh We do what they call residuals.
We have somebody check the chlorine
level at various
sites, different sites
uh in the week.
Uh We take samples
up to Albuquerque. Uh
We do quarterly
samples, uh
things like that. I'm
sure you're all aware of the lead copper
rule that's going around.
Uh
It helped a lot when they were putting
the fiber optic in because they
pothole by the meters and
stuff. Uh Had one
of our water people
uh document
that we went around
to the rest of them. Last week,
we have our documentation
just about ready to submit to
the federal government
for that. So,
uh we're fortunate
we have good,
good water. It's very,
very hard,
but it's good, good drinkable
water.
>> Ok. Well, thank you. I just, I
highly recommend that if there's
somebody not presenting
to your town council or
village council, whatever you call your
local governing
body that you're looking at that
and looking at trendlines and all that
because it sounds like you're collecting
some information. But
you know, based on the quality of what we
just saw in
the transportation of that
water, there's, there
could potentially be some health-related
issues there. Thank you both very
much mister mayor. Go right
ahead. >> Uh Mr
Chairman uh committee. I have one
thing that popped
up this morning. Uh We're
talking about revenue streams
and how to run our
village. Um
Some years ago, we had, we
challenged tax and rev
on our gas
tax that
we weren't. They were giving us
450 a month. We had two
stations and a
uh
uh distribution
point. We're getting
$450 a month. We
challenged that.
Gee, it jumped up to 2500
a month. I talked to
my clerk this morning.
It's been fluctuating, maybe
100 and $50.
So they are not giving
us our share of the gas
tax for roads.
Um, right now
we have three electrical
contractors working in the
village. One of them
told me yesterday they're spending
$500 a day on diesel
fuel
and the
usage. We're on a major
road. We have the hunters going
through the stations, do a great
business, the tax
and rev it shorten us
on our gas tax.
So we're gonna pursue that
and see, go
after them again. It's
unfortunate that we have to do
that because the
reporting the
sales, uh, the
gas tax paid is going to
tax and R uh,
there's no reason for
short changes. So
thank you. >> All right.
Well, thank you very much for that and I
really appreciate the presentations.
That's exactly what we're trying to do with these
presentations as we go around the
state. Thank you very much
to the presenters. I do want to let the
committee know it's now
1206. Now, we're gonna
come back at 115
sharp, please.
Um, we do have lunch
beyond the doors behind
Representative Madrid
over there for you and I want
to thank New Mexico Tech University
for providing lunch and
we'll stand in
