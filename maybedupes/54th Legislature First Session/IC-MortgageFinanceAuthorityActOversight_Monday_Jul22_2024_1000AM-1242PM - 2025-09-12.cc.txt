>> Uh, good morning madam Care and
uh, committee members.
>> Uh >> We
having you here with us
today. It seems like
a long time since we had our first
meeting >> back >> in, >> back in May,
>> a
quick uh update
uh on a couple of things. We have
some handouts in front of you.
Uh We have a
very good agenda today
uh focusing on the housing
development and you know,
that will be a little
bit uh and
some >> staff >> and we're also
gonna give you a
detailed update on the
housing trust fund and then uh
how do you need to se
>> you can take it
over the hand up that you have >> in front
of you. Uh It look like it's
a spreadsheet.
Uh It just gives you
our year to date production
uh that goes through the end
of a, so this is a physical
year today update.
Uh We have another four months left
in our physical year to do
>> that. He
>> if you'll notice on there that
uh we've been able uh
assists over
3600
individuals, >> some of those are
individuals >> with
our homeless program,
uh, with $490
million. Uh,
the vast majority of those
funds that come from our first
time Homebuyer program. You'll see
that we have a home of,
uh, we, the middle of the page for it
says homeownership
code. We'll take the bottom of
the over
3400, uh, families
that were assisted
that the different
lungs are made, that includes, uh, down
payment response with
the
392
million dollars.
>> If you flip the tapes towards your
back, uh,
>> or actually, if you stay on that first
page on, you'll see that
the funds have been
allocated across the state. There's
only currently one count
that we have not and that it
is harding counties. Uh,
so I'll assure you we'll work
hard between now and the end of the year
to make sure we have a, at least one,
family assisted in that
county to do that distribution
throughout the state.
Uh, the second page that
we put to the other side,
that is the same number.
It is broken out
in the various, uh,
continuum of,
you'll see homelessness,
additional, uh, rental
all the way down to
homeownership and other, on
the right hand side of the
same numbers, uh,
just a different way of looking at that,
that
the next page is something
that looks like this.
Uh, if you look at this chart
here, it's a very high-level
overview of the healthy trust
fund that I'll mention
to you on the uh
far left hand side
with the top. Uh
This is a $37
million. This is the first round
of money that we made available
and you can use the recurring
funds. $37
million that became available
last to provide by
about
23
100% of those funds
have been procured.
88%
were awarded and
we're currently saying that this
is that a little bit,
it's a 37 percent
expenditures.
Uh If you go
on over to the right
hand side, uh at the
top here, that is a
new money that we got
for this year. July
1st is when it became available
with seven tax money.
The second round of fund that was
$34 million.
Uh We just uh three
weeks into uh
this uh funds
here. We basically, we've already
awarded uh
100% of it has been,
we have a sent procurement
documents up for the, the
notice of a available
for RFP.
We've awarded $10
million of that.
Uh That's uh close to
30% of the funds have already been
awarded in uh less than a
month.
If you go down to the bottom, on
the right hand side there as
well, that's a $50
million that we uh that was
approved. Uh And we
wanna thank you for that uh
this uh this last legislative
session, uh, that this
ended back in, uh
February, uh,
out of that $50
million.45 percent
has been procured, uh,
12% onboarded. Now, you know,
I do have to let you know that, that
just became available to us also
on the first of July
and we actually don't have
a, the uh the
transfer funds yet.
Uh and the agreements
like we were leaning forward in the
South, as you would say
and uh forward allocated some of those
funds. Uh So
thank you for your support
there. The last
thing that I'll mention is on the back of that
page. Uh
We are very uh excited
to uh to announce
that we are rebranding
uh from our current logo
that you see in my little
pin here. Uh
We are rebranding to
uh
the
what you see here.
Uh
One of the reasons for that,
there's several main reasons. One
of them is ma doesn't fully
describe what M
fa does anymore. I'd
like to get back in 1975
when we first create it.
Uh And
the, when our mission
expanded in 1997
we went from mainly doing
single-family uh homeownership
programs to the full spectrum
of housing operations
from home industry, homeownership.
Uh And so, housing in New
Mexico uh
is what we do
and what we see is our mission.
We are not legally changing our
name. We're just uh rebranding
and hoping to be recognized
uh more as housing in New
Mexico versus N
FA uh as you
may uh
uh
agree with me that we get
confused a lot with the New Mexico
Finance Authority. So this will
be a good distinction between
us and then they can recognize
that we going forward.
We'll be having a, a
press conference
later this week to uh
kind of roll this out in the needs
assessment that will be presented to you
a little bit later as well. So
with that, I'll take
the questions. Uh madam sure
that to deal with you
>> have. Do you? Thank
you. Are there any questions
or comments for
committee?
And thank you. I just
want to briefly state
that when you mentioned
IY that
88%
of what's been awarded
since the bill that I
sponsored with the set of
134. I remember the,
that a bill on the I
say big, I mean, because it was the
first time that we
have and thanks to my
colleagues to help pass it,
um We have appropriated
at recurring dollars for house
every year. So
uh I'm happy to hear that the first
two allocations
that came out of that bill
um are
88%
used and, and allocated.
Thank you for that. It just
uh really uh
forces your
uh you know, your good work
and uh continued
uh efforts
towards more affordable housing
and also I like the fact that
you're remaining.
Uh, it's not a full
ring but it's kind of rebranding,
I guess. Uh, the
M fa I fully agree
that the mortgage finance authority
does not do justice
in that name because you do so
much more than finance
authority, you know, so
I'm happy that you're
renaming it House in
Mexico. And then
you,
so thank you for that.
And then one other minor thing and
then I'm gonna move on to the next item.
Is that um
the 15 minutes that we just
appropriated is as we
know, that is
um a nonrecurring
appropriation that is bricks
and mortar severus tax
dollars. And the
um from the cap
basically my that we
have health care capital
that way. And so
I'm happy that
45% is already
cured and you are going
to distribute that help
hospital. The knee is so big
out there. I'm
happy.
Yes, mister. Yes. Thank
you Senator madam
chairman and Izzy, thank you so >> much.
I just uh
we get at any point
or can you give us
now to whom
to which project?
The 10
million that's already been awarded
this year from the
uh Severance tax
bonds. And then the 59
the 66
and 7800 and
50,000 that war.
Do we know which projects those
are? Can you share those with
us madam Chair
syndrome? You know, right
off the top of my head. I I don't
have that information but that
by the end of the meeting, I'll, I'll
give you the details on that.
>> Great.
>> Thank you. >> All righty.
We are going to
want to have a development
development in New Mexico.
Bobby.
She's a
Financial
Bobby.
>> Thank you, madam. Sure. I, I wanna
thank you Bobby for joining us
here today. He is a longtime
partner with Grey with
the morning 41.
Uh great things that uh
JL Gray does is that they
always do things in the
area and developments.
They also do a lot of stuff
across the state in the rural
areas. So thank you,
Bobby.
Thank you madam, chair members of
the committee. Thank
you for this opportunity to
speak.
As was mentioned, my name is
Barie Group and I am the
CFO
Yeah,
just to get a little background
about Jo Gray, we were
formed in
1985.
Uh Scott Fishburne,
Jack Curry started the
company. I actually
started in the same business in
1984 when I was
in Texas.
I was a friendly competitor
at Jo Grade in 2005.
I can work with Jo
Grade. Moved
here actually.
Now I have a new Mexican drive
less. So I'm no longer with
text
maybe in my heart,
but
theoretically, I'm
text.
What we do JL
Gray is affordable
housing and that's all we
we, we specialize
in rural communities, but
we're
affordable housing.
We have experience in five
states. We deal
with taxpaying agencies
of New Mexico Mortgage
Finance Authority,
Utah Housing
Corporation,
Colorado Housing
Finance Authority,
the Arizona Department of
Housing and the Texas
Department of Housing and
Community
Affairs.
I list of those in order
to put an order food
is the best
section eight over by
contractors. We deal
with New Mexico or
Finance Committee,
Colorado Housing
Finance Authority and
Southwest Housing Compliance
Corporation which is off of
Texas.
I'm just gonna give you a little
overview of
Jr Gray.
So I'm gonna give some
numbers.
We have 100 and 65
properties in our
portfolio.
100 and 32 of those
properties are here in New
Mexico.
We have 7331
units of,
of families that we provide
housing for
6009
units are here in New
Mexico.
So our tax credit properties,
we have 100 and 8,
86 of those
are here in New Mexico. All
86 are over city
by M
fa.
We have personally developed
56 properties
and 51 in
New Mexico.
We own 67
properties. 58
are in New Mexico.
We have home
properties
which is a loan for
us. Pretty big
program. We have 44
properties, 43
of which are in New Mexico.
We deal with the United States
Department of Agriculture,
rural Development, which
means like
section eight, but they're in rural
communities. We have 83
of those types of properties.
And 60 are in
Mexico
section. Eight
properties,
we have 2012
of those are New Mexico
Senior properties which
we love. We have
25 properties and
17 in New
Mexico, we
also are the largest
provider of farm labor
housing in the state of New
Mexico. We have 12 total
properties and nine. Here in the
United States,
we do special
needs
properties that are specifically
for the disabled. We have
11 out of 12 here in
New Mexico
homeless properties.
We have four
properties in New
Mexico that are
homeless and we
have one property which is
called the Resolution Trust
Corporation, which
is, it's
an old program, but ma
oversees that and we have one
of those. We
have 35
properties that have
loans that came from
New Mexico or primary
school.
We have done recent
rehabs in the state of New
Mexico of older
problems that
we were preserving.
We've done 31
properties recently
that consists of
1505
units.
We use tax
credit
4%
bonds. We
did 25 of the
31
and those were in uh
what we call Moab
20. So when we
started that, it was
about eight years ago, I
think it might have been longer.
But one of the people
from M fa named
it the mother of all
towns. So
that's where the word Moak
came from. And we
did 20 properties
in three phases more
South and central they
cover
Anthony, New Mexico,
Columbus and
Ging to part of
the South
Artesia or
in Las Vegas
for Tali and
Riodosa were part of the
Central
and Baral
Bloomfield and
Gallup were part of
the and we're
extremely proud of the
work that was done in those
properties are all
completed and
line and doing
well. All of
those without exception
or afford. Well,
we just finished up
100 units in
Grants, New
Mexico.
That was a, a pretty
pretty uh
detailed.
Um
I read
out
we bought four more
properties too in Albuquerque
in Santa Fe, which we're in
the middle of right now. And I
believe we, we
set the biggest
bond, the
record with our O
A clean. I think we broke
it with the Albuquerque in Santa
Fe Car.
So we're, we having
242 units
here in Albuquerque
and 228 units
in Santa Fe. And
those are what
we do just so that you, all of these
are old properties probably
built in the sixties and
seventies and
our all new cabins,
all new appliances,
water heaters,
heaters, and A
CS and back in Santa Fe,
they didn't have any A
CS and we are
put in AC or we're
putting in a CS back
on the properties. We're utilizing
uh solar panels.
We also are
doing
four properties that
are called PR
LF preservation
revolving Lron
through M FA
and we're starting those
one in cloud cro one
and two from Carry and two and two of
those
tax credit new construction,
which we've done a lot of those.
We're currently doing one
in Socorro in
New Mexico. As we
speak, that property
will serve um
special needs.
Uh We're partnered with
the Socorro Housing uh
Authority down there
and that, that's with
a, a new construction
9% tax
cuts. We're also the
management company
for a tax credit
new construction department being
built in Las Cruces.
100 and 44 means
we're not the developer on
that. But
um we will be the
management
company.
We are looking at
doing
approximately
25 more
properties with
a rehab of
4% lods.
16 of those
are in New Mexico.
M fa doesn't know about
this yet. We have
has that money but they're
bringing together
16 more
properties in the
state.
I've been asked to talk about
some of the challenges in
development. And I
know
to be honest, I, I,
I'm gonna sound like
I work for M fa
because I am probably one of the
these cheerleaders because
I think they're one of the best groups
we've ever done in business
for. But our
challenges have never really
been with fa our
challenges in
construction or
rehab cost
of construction has just gone through
the roof and that's hurt
us. We can't
build as many humans as we
used to
the city. Permits are
sometimes ridiculous to
get, to be
honest.
Albuquerque and Santa Fe
unfortunately, are two more
students. When I say they're
not our entities. I shouldn't say it
that way, but they're very
difficult to get
the process through. And then once
we have the permits, we were
trying to do our work,
they take forever to come, do
an inspection so that we can go
on to the next
phase. We just
experienced that in Santa
Fe and it was
very costly for
us.
Another challenge
sometimes is working because
we don't work with just M
FA when we do these properties,
we're working with P
for section eight. We're
working with USDA rural
development as
their problems
and I can get horror stories
of how difficult
it's been to work with you to
get all be
working with M AM
FA is always
ready to go. They
have their
ducks in a row, they have
everything signed off
on and RD
takes forever and they drag
their feet. In fact,
the four
properties that I've
mentioned in
um Southern New New
Mexico, the PR
LFs were held up
forever by ruled.
Um It should have been
rehab probably six
years ago when we
were approved for these
loans. And it took
till just this
year where I had
to go to the
national office
in DC and get
RD to do their job.
No reflection on the M
FA because they were
the,
I see that some of the successes
for affordable housing. Of
course, to me
with the NM fa
this is the tax credit program.
I think it's a great,
great program. I
wish we had more
people living in New Mexico
because tax credits
are allocated based on our
population. We're
such a small state. We don't
get as many tax
credits as I wish we
could. The gap
financing that's available
for the M FA and other
agencies is
makes our success.
And where I said the challenges
about working with
multiple agencies
also, I believe that's our
success because
not one
entity by their self
brings enough money to the
table to help us
when we work tax
credits through M fa
and rural development, rental
assistance together
and those properties are easier
to build and of course,
become more successful in the
long run. So working
with the multiple agencies
is something that
we really
like.
They asked me and
um and they gave me an
agenda and said we would like
for you to discuss
and talk about
what needs an improvement
in that.
A
and there's only one thing and it
only happens once and I don't
even really wanna talk about it
because it will make it sound
negative.
I'd rather talk
about the good things that
happened in the day.
The one thing that
I've learned about
M fa
is that
we do business in five
states.
They are the only
agency that
comes to our properties
that works with us and says we're
coming to look for
compliance,
not non-compliance.
And I don't know if that makes sense
to you, but when they're coming with
their guns drawn other
agencies and
looking to
find negative
things.
It done the best kind of
partnership.
M fa
that quote that I just
said is that
we look for compliance
on non non-compliance is
said by Patrick Ortiz
many, many years ago
at a conference in Las
Vegas that
and it's something that's always
stuck, stuck
with
one of our partners in
California. His name is
Karen Buckley does a lot
of work with us. Their company
does business in 38
states and
she claims that New Mexico
Mortgage Finance Authority is
by far the best
group that we work
with in 38
states. I can only
testify directly to
five. What's
important about this is,
is that once we get
money or tax credits
or loans from
Mexico, Morgan's Finance
Authority they have a
responsibility
to give oversight
and they do a lot of inspections
on our property. And
when they announce they're doing
inspections, no matter
what, we tell our site
managers, they're scared
to death that they don't
do that. They're gonna lose their job
and they're always worried.
And what we try to explain
is that M FA is gonna
come and help us
make improvements where we're
lacking in workers.
And once they experience
the staff that comes from M
fa physically do our
problems, then they
see that. Ok, this is
really a part
and they look forward, I've
been told many times by
my staff that they
look forward to the m
uh asset managers
coming and talking
to them about talking to them
about ways to do their
files better to
do things that the
problem
I, this is something
that's really important to me. I've been
in this business a long time. I've
served, I'm now currently on the
board of directors, National
Apartment Association,
but I've been involved with
the
industry associations on the
national level for a long time.
And one of the things I'm proud
of early nineties,
late eighties, we,
we got
to, to
change their letters
where they would provide us
letters of their inspection
to say thank you for your
time and your
staff will be at your property.
They used to start off
their letters with
negative. We
found this back. Can you just
at least be nice
for a minute, then
you can tell us what was wrong
and then end up being nice.
So if you, if you
saw a lot better,
um I have a lot to do
with that. My group of, you
know, let's try to be
partners.
One of the other things besides
the asset management
department, which is the
long-term ongoing
with us is for
example, we have a
lot of properties that we
purchase that we buy
from other groups
that no longer wanna be in this
industry, maybe they don't
have the capacity anymore.
And when we do that M
fa has been very
great to work with
when we take over a property
that's in trust that we didn't
make that way.
They help us either recast
the loan, maybe forgiveness
of some of that etcetera
so that we can make that
property by
because there is a land
use restriction agreement
on all the properties that we
deal with that, keep
it affordable
housing for
2030 40 to 50
years, depending on what
property it is.
And if those nodes are not
working out or whatever,
you know, we don't want to see these
properties before
close on, we wanna see
them recast
wework so they're
very good in their own
department. And that
decision to work
on the development
side, I
find M fa to be
this extraordinary
work with.
I don't know
that what I'm
fixing to say is a
fact, but I'm gonna
say it because I think it
is if we're
not the biggest customer of
NAI,
I do know
that we are the largest
affordable housing provider
in the state of New
Mexico.
There's other companies
that are big but they're
in conventional or market
rate units.
We don't have much
competition in the
affordable housing industry. The
ones that I do know of
are good players as
well. But
we're one of the few
management companies
that are very aggressive in the
balance too. So
we know
all facets of
working with that
building side,
the long side,
three years down the road,
the rehab side
and then managing those
problems, you know,
and I, I just wanna close
and say that I'm honored to be
able to speak here before you
today just to let
you know that this group from
my perspective
is
ex
thank you very much Bobby for
this. And um
before we go on, let
me uh
go to San Losa.
You were first on the list and
then we have which one is
that?
You too? Thank you,
Santi.
Thank you, Senator
Loss.
I know.
Sure.
Oh, this is
funny. How are
you
all
that shouldn't all
that, you know,
you know, more hard
time on her
medicine.
70.
Yeah, sure.
What causes
that?
What causes that
uh
Senator
Madam chair? I
wish I knew
what causes
that
in Santa Fe.
Give you specific cause it just
happened.
We're arguing over
an existing property
and the
landscape.
They're more concerned
about the
landscaping than they care.
I'm sorry to
try and say what they
think. But we're
spending more time
on worrying about the
landscape. Do we care
about renovating land
sites?
They held us up for
over six months before
GV started
while we were doing this.
We had a, a subcontractor
accidentally break a gas
lines.
That's a shame.
Ended up being good because we're getting
all
when we made
all of the re and,
and by the way, Senator,
our residents
had to be evacuated and they
were put into hotels
at our cost,
complete
property
when we fixed everything
2 to 3 weeks before
we can get an inspection for them to
come back so that we can
do.
That's the kind of stuff that
hurts us because
as you can imagine, I'm
spending
6464
families in a hotel in that
particular unit.
And, uh,
and I'm stuck, I can't go
to do anything else because
I don't have that
gas,
you know about
sure
that
right answer
help.
I wish I knew Senator.
Um, it bothered
me. It bothers
me. It took us about
the same amount of time in
Albuquerque. Our permits
originally for this is
for a rehab, sir. This
is not for new
construction
and not
that I think that it matters
less,
but I do think that it should
be less of
a job to
fix
and I'm not
Sure.
So when you say
we
like process is
that they
c
Senator and madam chair,
I've never bought
an property.
We do new construction. So we
buy land. But
when we buy existing
properties,
people
got into the
business 2030
4050 years ago
and they did it for tax
benefits and then they don't want
them anymore and they go up
for sale and we're
known as the company that
applied. We're in
contract right now to buy
five proper in New Mexico.
And all of them are existing
affordable housing. I don't
know that we'll get them
all. We think one of them
will get.
But that,
that's what we do. We think
that it's just as important to
preserve
housing, especially
affordable housing as it is
to feel
because if we don't
preserve what we have,
they're gonna be shut
down.
>> Not sure. >> Thank you. Thank
you >> very much.
There's a lot of information,
you know, we go
on
special,
we wish we be at
all
on this short
staff.
So is there
for
training,
said
arts?
Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Senator. How are I
Senator Pat >> and Senator
GCP? Thank you
madam chair. Thank you for your
presentation. Excellent
information not really
have here, but I
would call an actual practitioner
and you know, trying to wait around
New Mexico to get this work
uh to spend a good amount,
fair amount of time with the, the
executive CEO as of
last year on the Housing
Investment Council as
representing the Senate. And then we have a
representative who also on to speak
also Representative
Dixon and everything
that you talked about. We talked
about it then to
because the other in-state
developers and builders
and all that. So I'm just
concerned that we're still talking
about um you know, II
a kind of can do
type I, I
using
full speed to all the kind of
things that I'll do it.
Um
Why are we continuing to have this
conversation? I don't expect you to answer
that. But
uh
what can you tell me about
specifically what we
need to do? Because when I hear things
like both permitting is too long
and uh C OS
are a problem and all
sorts of different things like that.
Infrastructure, we've done sort
of a lot of infrastructure side
to provide some funding and
try it out there.
But um
you have like best practices,
maybe give us that.
I don't want to be talking about this
about it. It's
ridiculous. It's, you know, it's
weird. Uh
What specifically do we need to be
doing if you wanted,
comment on that now or do you
wanna get us
some, you know, if you happen to have any
great best
practices that we can utilize
because we're, we're
our own worst problem here in New
Mexico. Uh
And, and I'm, I'm, I'm very, very
worried about us having
this very same conversation. 12
months, we're having this
conversation, 12
months,
>> Senator Madam
chair. I,
I wish I knew the,
to me the answer is
still
do it
best
approver >> my question as to
how do you have some,
how that we can learn
from that
would
so in Colorado I'm gonna
interrupt, but in Colorado,
Madhi, the governor
there, uh threatened to take
all of that and make the state
function. And it's
amazing how quickly the towns
and cities and counties got
their.
And, uh, do we
need to do that, >> uh,
Senator in, in the State
of New Mexico?
Most of the areas that
we, this is, is overseen
by the state. We don't >> have that
problem. >> It's
the city of Albuquerque,
Santa >> Fe where we have
the Santa Fe
works and that, that's where I was
going with that. The amount of chance, sir,
um, is this
the, the governor of Colorado,
uh, deal
with a threat to just take it all
over that
way? There wasn't city or county
function. The building, you
go build the house and went into one
building. You got all
your,
whatever you needed to get that
done and you walk out of
there with that and then, you know
exactly where to go to
solve problems rather
than stay doing their
part and a city or
accounting or both
putting a strain, hold on
you and
sure it screws around. I'm a
business owner myself.
I,
uh, supplies
materials labor,
all of that gets affected.
I have contracts that I
bring to my company. Sometimes our
sales process is two weeks. Sometimes
it's seven years. I hate
the ones that are seven years because they
show up later. I look at that
and say, well, gosh, you know,
that's gonna cost you about 25
or 30% more than I originally
quoted because you waited so long
to get to work that years.
Is that what's happening with us
here? Yes,
sir.
Yeah, I just, we,
we just continue to talk about this
and it's kind of ridiculous.
Um Have
anything you can recommend or any
areas you recommend?
I'll be the first time to take a look
at it. I sure
stepped into a bus on
housing this last year was
a fun experience.
Um Just
a, one of my most favorite
fellows and state senators
actually got a little mad
at me a little bit. I love
her to death. She's like a
good mentor of mine.
And so, you know, we just, we need to
get something that
we're gonna be talking about this, the
website, she called all of us out of the
office. We can't. So this
>> and if you don't mind, uh
Senator Madam chair
and I talked about the
delay of
they, we,
we had the gas fixed
but it was over
two weeks, not quite
three.
I believe that we had at
least $30 million
already in construction loans.
And so we were
ss
two weeks worth of interest
when I can't go any
further that we
have to pay, not counting
what I had to pay
for the
residents living
in hotels.
And so any delays
that we have when we're
doing this big of
numbers,
the interest alone
>> just >> still >> be ridiculous.
And, >> and I have to say
that when we do that we
only have X number of
dollars in this box.
We have to say, what do I have
to cut out now?
And it's very frustrating.
That was an avoidable
situation. And I don't
wanna be
uh Santa Fe cause I
love the city.
>> But I think they're
>> have a reputation
for how slow they
are and
Albuquerque is not part of
them. >> Well,
madam chair and I'll stop now. But
you know, thank you for having
me. I'll call
back and intestinal
order to, to continue dealing with
us. But I'm sure there are
a lot of people that don't want to move to
Mexico because of these very
problems throughout here.
So don't give a
call. One of us, we will go and be
the door down because one of us will go
with this one big sledgehammer, get that
door open for you cause you've
got to get these houses. I mean, this
is, we are really dire
straits right now house.
And, um, I'd like
to know if you can think of, you know, I have to tell me
right now, but there's some
specific
uh, best practices
or case studies that you can
share with us. I'd be
all there is to learn from this.
We'll get you. Thank you.
>> Sure. Thank you, Senator.
All right, Senator
>> Pino. Thank you madam Chairman.
And, and thank you very much mister
Look for your
presentation. I was gonna build
on what Senator
Padilla said because I,
I jotted that down to the
Colorado legislation.
I maybe it
wasn't completely with
the governor that
originally proposed.
But, but as I, as I
read about it,
I thought they had adopted
some of that in terms
of regulation
and, and that it did make
the cities much more
responsive to the
needs of, of the contractors.
Um, iii I
would want
us to put this on our,
on our possible legislation
list that is to
research that Colorado
legislation, madam
chairman and,
and, and to take a look at at
what they were proposing
as a way of speeding this,
the implementation
of, of, of these,
getting the inspectors out there
faster,
streamlining the whole
process, not having multiple
visits to a, a
city office
required in order to get started,
things like that, that
just achieve
no valid
purpose. We could,
we could do the deal with
that in a piece of
legislation in the next session.
I think that would be something this
committee might want to take
a look at. So I'd like to put it on
the marker. One
question I had for you and madam
chairman and Mister Griffith
was
what we've seen in Albuquerque
and I think a couple of other cities
are beginning to do this now.
Are these hotel
conversions?
What's your, what's your
take on that? Is that a good
practice? Does it create
its own set of problems?
Does your company do
those
>> Senator madam
chair? Yes, we
do.
And
I don't like it.
Um,
I,
we have one in, in Las
Cruces that we did years
ago. We managed others,
but we're doing one in Santa Fe
right now, which is called,
what's called a Lampliter.
And we're converting it to
what's gonna be called
Beals.
If I'm not mistaken, we
are in our 4th,
3rd or fourth year and
we haven't done either
again. It
is the
bureaucracy that we have to go
through.
I, I don't wanna get off
subject. That
part of that problem
had to do
with
an attorney for the
state and,
and we've had more meetings
than I've ever had on any
property back up there.
The one in Socorro,
that's a new deal that's not
far behind. And that was
not
permits, even
though I wanted to say Senator,
that the permits for
that pro property have
been delayed, but
there were other circumstances
that could have been delayed.
So here we are
three and four years later
and we can't do any work
properly in Santa
Fe because
of your workers.
And, um,
but I, you asked
me to stay in Senator
Truck and hang in there.
I don't know if we love it so
much or just a little bit
crazy, but we
don't do conventional
properties. We wanna
do this. We
sort of know the paperwork's
hard and
some of these negative things
that I'm bringing up
are
as you can see outside
of New Mexico mortgage finance.
With the oversight. It's
not anything they can do,
but I do wanna tell you that
they do work with us when
we have, when we had this issue
with, uh, an attorney for
the state that
we
working with.
Um M fa has
been helping
us and
giving, coordinating
meetings. We had a
meeting in the governor's
boardroom and that
thing was completely full. And
one of the, one of the members
there on the way
outside, this may be
the most extensive board
meeting I've ever seen because of who
was in that room. It was high
ups from everywhere and we
left that room and nothing has
changed. So I just
want to make a comment.
Your question
is
one of the problems that we
find with hotel
conversions.
It's, they're already
small and you can do
single room or occupancy.
That's not a problem. But
the infrastructure is a major
problem because they
are not built
for the right
electric, the A
CS, et cetera,
refrigerators,
microwaves, those
things are not really part of
that. So to convert that
you have to bring in
new electricity,
tons of cost and
just transformation
for the transformers. All
new wiring is probably
not enough new,
new uh breaker boxes,
etcetera. So just to get
it where it can carry the
load for long-term
residency. And some of
those ho hotels,
motels are older.
I like to do it.
It's just too
costly.
Uh It's almost
easier to build
something from in your
heart.
I apologize for
getting off of, but the
hotels we're
doing, we're
gonna do more.
But I don't, I
don't like it
as much >> at the risk of pursuing
madam chairman at the risk of pursuing
it. Your, your
detri, the
attorney's objection.
Did it have anything to do with the
anti donation clause? No,
>> sir. It was all
about. He
was not
comfortable.
We, we, we
actually received
money from the
governor
and there was all
of this debate over how
we were using
it.
I, I don't wanna get in
his head and say
things, but they weren't even
questioning us as
a company
and it
wasn't,
I think we,
after all these
meetings,
he's converted a little bit,
but there was a little bit
of allegations
that were very
slanderous.
And it's like, can you check this
out? You know, I, I,
I'm, we could get
on that. But, but,
but that to me
was, it's still
off.
We have not broke
through that completely.
The Department of Finance is
who it was and they
were the ones allocated money.
They just wanted to make sure. And,
and when you have all these
different gap
fundings coming, you know,
and we have this money that has
to go in, in that particular
property just so that you'll
know the
city of Santa Fe,
the County of Santa
Fe, the
state
and that there's been so
many different funding
opportunities so that
when we're finished,
there's not a mortgage so that
we can keep the rents
very minimal
and, and it's designed
for special needs and
home, it's not 100%
but it's designed to be
way down
in affordability
and, and here
we are years later,
you know, one of the things they wanted to
do is to be able to get the home
on the street winner.
We've got four winners
go by and we still can
for you.
Thank you. Thank you, >> madam.
Thank you,
Senator. All
right, representative.
My next, thank
you madam chair.
Um Thank you sir for
your and
insight. Um
Actually, I've been hearing this for
35 years. I
most have the
problems with
permitting and inspections
and, and nothing
and I need to say this man, sure
that nothing has changed.
Um And you
know, I used to work in the development
process
for,
so I'm intimately
familiar with the
perming process and
the codes.
Um What my
concern is is
that honestly
that we here, we've
been like, uh
Senator Padilla said that
you hearing this for a
long time, I heard
this as a staff member.
I heard this, I mean,
and I'm just wondering
if it seems to
me like, you know, I
always think the leadership starts
at the top and
I, when I say that I'm talking about
the mayor and the county
commissioners and
people, the codes have
not changed
to reflect the
need to. And
that is huge.
And what concerns
me madam chair is that
every
municipality, every
county has a different
code. And I understand
that because they all have
their own
jurisdiction.
But
court
and, and, and I built
housing, you
know, in Burle
counties.
Um, so
understanding that time
is money, you know,
and, and if you're not
meeting those
expectations,
you're losing money
on a daily
basis.
I heard you
not here, um,
talk about the
gas line as you
broke the busted,
which is a whole different
process,
but in terms of
the city and the county
codes, um,
I think, you know, one of the
things and I, I don't
have all the answers,
but I, I do have
some ideas and I know
like groups like a
off and places like
those have been working on
these issues for many, many
years.
Um
There was a time
I here in the city of Albuquerque
when we talked about an
ombudsman
to help get through these
processes.
Um Is that something
that you think
that
on a statewide basis
that we can get the
leadership
to understand
how important it is
to put these resources
together? And that
actually time is
going to get those
permits. Is that something
that would
maybe
help
you?
>> Representative? I,
I madam chair, I really
am. My
mind's thinking because we
talked about maybe making as a
statement
cause right now we
need,
I'm with the Park Association
in Mexico.
We're very involved with a
lot of, um but
it's at the state level and they
really don't have jurisdiction.
I, I guess, you know, so
it's, it's been sort
of very frustrating
that we could get your
help. I don't
think you have that authority
but maybe the
governor II,
I think something
like that would be great because as
I said, everywhere
else outside of the
big cities
we get through very
quick. That's
why we, I mean,
there is a need for rural
housing anyway,
but one of the reasons that we
pushed out there is just
with the draw procedures.
>> Yeah, sure. Um Can
you mentioned um the
site plan of the
landscaping? I mean,
there's an ordinance for that
and there's an expectation.
So the
staff and the
details of
that. Could
you elaborate on that? You
said you mentioned that they have
some issues with your
landscaping
>> representative to madam
chair. It's all a
matter of how you look at it.
There's a percentage of
amount of grass's,
this property has been there since
the sixties, in my opinion,
it has very little
fast, but we're
arguing over
that.
So,
yeah, I just wanna say
that, you know
what we thought was
gonna cost us $50,000
landscaping because of their
changes is gonna cost us
$650,000.
When I say
that
I, I wish I had pictures to
show you how I think how painful
this problem.
We don't have any problems
there, but I gotta spend
600,000 more
dollars that I could
have put on the inside of
my. It's
sort of nice that, it looks
good to people
that live there but they care more
about where they're
at. Most
of the time. They're not
outside going. Oh,
I'm glad.
But I just wanna say, I
understand we wanna conserve
water but the, to
convert grass to
zeros, it's not
easy and it's very
costly. So that's one of
the,
the trees, the
shrubs
to me are beautiful. They're
already there. I don't
know. I understand that
you're gonna build something from
scratch. Let's
follow the rules.
But there ought to be something
that there's a little bit
of ok
grandfathering you,
you know, to a
degree maybe instead of
15% and that
30% grass or
something like that. But
that's the problem. They wanna
make it as if it was
reconstruction and
in all due respect
when I drive through
Santa Fe and I
see the weeds in
the sidewalks that I
believe are the city's
responsibility.
And when I see all this
junk out there, I'm going
your own heart case.
I get a little upset.
It's like, come on, let, let, let's
work together.
>> Hi, Sharon. And then there's,
um, do you guys know
what my background is?
It seems to me like there's,
um,
there's really some things
that are being very subjective
in terms of, uh,
the codes and how they're
being implemented. That's one of
the issues that I see.
Um, the other thing
is this expedited,
um, uh,
process to
understand that we
are in a crisis in
terms of housing.
And, and when I said
earlier about, you
know, it has to come from the top
leadership. So
getting that,
that sort
of
point across, I guess,
to the leadership
that we need
to start looking through these
issues
that and
the, especially when
there's, when there's
government money involved,
I mean, not to say that we
should go around
the rules, but to
say that we
need to look at,
you know, the landscaping
and whether or not
we need to be the
ordinance or if there's
a way to get
around some of that a little
bit and to keep some of the
existing
landscaping. So
there's a, there's a lot, there's a
lot in
this nut
to crack, I guess.
Um I'm very
happy to serve to sit with
you at any time
and um,
speak out because
we are in, in a
crisis.
And, um,
and we've been in this
crisis
in terms of expediting,
as I mentioned earlier
and I've worked with NAO, I've
worked with these different groups that have
been trying to change the
Albuquerque development
process and we
thought we were gonna do that with the
new codes,
a new Zing, but
obviously that hasn't
happened. And, and
it's very, very concerning
to me that we're still
talking about this and having
this conversation.
I'd be happy to sit with you,
surgeon and chat with
you a little bit more about how we
can what we can
do.
>> I, I could, I'd like to say just
a couple of things were quickening.
All
it concerns me in our
state that there's,
and I'm, I'm
so glad that this room is
full. Our
state representatives and
senators.
There are groups that keep trying
to increase our real
estate
taxes.
There's groups that are trying to
put control into
effect. I'm
affordable housing
rent control.
I, I'm a little neutral on
that. I I,
I'm
sorry. But
when you start doing
this, we
already have a problem with the
state, Texas.
Real real estate taxes
are higher, but it's
easier to build in Texas
this year. If
we let
our ta real estate taxes
go up and some other things,
the investors that come
by are just gonna go to
Arizona and Texas
and I'm very concerned about
that. We are new
Mexican. We
do business here.
Our corporate office is here and
we wanna see
we have a major housing
crisis, a major
housing crisis. There's
estimates of
40,000 plus
units that's speeded
state. Some
people say it's more,
I don't know, but every time
that we open a new property
we fill up.
And so I just wanna say
to you, there's other issuess besides
what I brought up that are on
the horizon that we
may wanna look at. And
then in conclusion, I was
asked to speak about M
fa
uh I'm proud
to be a part. I'm
proud to be a partner.
I'm proud. I know almost
every employee
have nobody
that works. Here is a problem.
They are the greatest group.
And if the rest of the
state have that mentality,
I think we could put a big
dent into our housing
process.
>> Thank you very much for that.
We're gonna move on because of
types that we presented vice
chair of you are
next. Thank
you.
>> Thank you madam
chair.
Thank you. >> Thank you
madam chair. I
just wanna
think about, you know, >> I
hear this over and over
again in the committee.
I'm excl at a
lot. They uh
everywhere I go
it's a problem can't get,
the service,
cannot give you so much to
lose. You can get so much for
that and then hungry go.
That's the thing
I'm asking you people that
survive a
finance.
So you did a study
on, uh,
but, uh, how much you pay
these people to do the
inspections,
uh,
have done a
study on what our
staffing levels
are for
inspectors in the state of New
Mexico.
All right, when you look at
the,
or being an inspector, something
like 16 bucks
an hour
and, uh,
they can go as
contractors and electrical
contractor, they, they're
double bucks an
hour and you know,
yourself like a
contractor or,
or even an apprentice is gonna
be in the thirties.
So, how do we
keep
inspectors out
there doing
their job? We don't
fail.
And >> that's my
>> concern. I see that in
all of the committees,
million dollars have a line
different than her committees.
So I get to hear from all different
edges and I ask
the same question over and over
again. How can
we expect
get anything better
than what we do? What we
pay? We're
not any,
oh, Yeah, we expect the same
service as if
we were me.
I mean it used to be to where
the benefits that you got from. The
state of New Mexico, the health
insurance and
everything. But we're
thinking a little thing
is in today's
world.
It doesn't work.
I just
vomiting. I don't need that
but I just
wanted to make sure you were there sitting
with mys
cause I want you
to
basically what my blood, you
know, and keep me away from
money.
Ok?
You work on money
to think of
how much are you
paying these inspectors
and how do you
expect to keep them
on the job with the
money that you're
paying?
>> Thank you. Thank you.
>> Very good >> point. All
right, we
don't have anyone else on the
list. But um,
I, I just wanted to comment
a little bit on this. I come
local government myself. So
I was a county manager, county
commissioner prior to this. The reason
I mentioned that is only because
I dealt with issuess just
like this. I agree.
Many years we have seen the
same issue with built
and permits being held up
and codes
and regulations, ordinances
and so on. Sometimes, you know, they're
not being adhered to or they
are too strict or they
are not revisited to
accommodate the new
environment, which is a great
price for the basic New
Mexico Health.
That being said, I see
at least one thing that
perhaps we could all
work together to improve
on, to improve
on. For example,
the uh increasing
the uh
level of permits or
being an issue within a short period of
time that
takes
communication. I
think communic communication is the biggest
issue that we
see. I see way that
has a some
potential to change here.
If we all work together with
cities and counties,
I see at the state level,
that's where we come in, that's where we're
responsible for changing
the construction industries, division
and all these regulations that we
have, that we have
direct a
authority to
do
um with the state, with the
cities and the counties. Yes,
we have state laws that we can put
together. We know
that us doing the state
laws and regulations
without them at the table
is not gonna work. That's not
what we're about. We're
about collaboration, working
together with our
municipalities and
our local governments to
see how we can effectuate
something better than what we
are today. So
where, where do we fall? Then
we fall within
communication. How do we
do? You know
this is reality
is, and I've been here
Bobby 29 years
of chairing and co-chair in this
committee. And I can tell you
that I see and I
hear some big
frustration and concerns
about this. But
the reality really is
one thing is that these
bodies are municipalities
and counties are
elected as we
know they are elected
officials, they have
their own authority to establish
their own codes in order.
And all we can
do, just
ask them and work with
them to see how
we can again,
work together to see
how we can accommodate
this gas that we're seeing,
falling behi or falling worse
and worse behind if we don't make
changes here.
And I think
that just,
I, I thought I had seen a change
a while back several years
ago just to see the
change in administration
happen, that administration
changes both at the state
level, department has
changed, then we have
the counties at the county
level, city level,
that's just the way things
are. And so
it's incumbent upon us
to continue to work
um together expecting
those changes and see how we can
transition when
those changes come to
maintain that stability that
we need. Cause we
gain a little ground and
then it's dropped during the
changes. And so
I think that that's something
that we can work together
on to do. I like what
Senator T Zino mentioned
about looking at the legislation
in Colorado, see
what we can do.
Uh Let's look at it,
see, um maybe N
fa I, you and your staff
that we can get us a some
an analysis on that legislation
to see what exactly they
did, um how it's
working, how they work
together with cities and counties
to get this done because
in posing something at
the state level,
for counties and cities to
adhere to without
them having a seat
at the table is
beautiful and
so I
can tell you it's just not
going to work. I
reinstate that in different
words or restate
that I should say.
So, let's look at that
Izzy and bring it for, thank you, sir
Andino for that
suggestion and see what we
can see from that and how
it's working. Um
and then um the
salaries, for example,
that are great vice chair
here was talking about for
staffing and so on
again at the Senate at the State
level, we can do a lot.
We are doing actually
a, a very big comprehensive
study with the
um state person
office and, and others
under contract to see
how we're doing in
our staffing uh gaps.
And also the kind
of like desk audits in a way
to see who does what, how we
can um
fix the problem and,
and redo the uh the job
specifications for employees
and so on to get them paid
where they deserve because they
are underpaid. We
can do that at the state level.
We can't do it
where we're talking about. The
problems are today. Most
of the problems is in
the delay in permits
and, and maybe
um codes that would be too
stringent to accommodate
higher density levels for
development, for example,
and so on, that is
at the city and county level.
So I think
that perhaps
working together um with
them to, to
see how we can change
this? Could a
maybe some kind of nib
I'm gonna ask you directly, maybe we
already have it. OK. Do
we have some kind of like a
collaborative effort that
happens with counties and
cities uh on
this at all? Need some kind of not
really a task force
necessarily, but
some kind of group that
we can work
with to uh ensure
that all these issues are being
discussed. What do you
have? Easy madam
>> chair? I know that um
we have the Council of
Governments to help
some of the
um areas. I'm
not aware of what's here,
but we work closely with
the
Eastern Plains Council
and governments, but
they don't cover these
cities. And I think
that they have a big influence.
Also, I'd like to say
that for the
salaries,
charge us
an extra two or 3
$400
and we'll pay it to get
people that could be put into
a pot that I to pay uh
the inspector. So,
but uh we
will not be opposed to that matters
here. >> Ok,
thank you, Lizzy. Can I give
you all the questions? >> Yes. Uh
madam chair. Uh
We uh the M fa
oversees the Affordable Housing
Act. Uh and the a
lot of local government, I think we
have close to
3537
local governments that have
housing plans and MS
that they have adopted to be
able to uh donate
to work affordable housing.
That's as close as we come
with uh working with local government
and those type of issues. But we do
attend the municipality and
location accountings. So we'll
do a better job of uh
communicating
uh the some
of the challenges uh that
are going on across the state
with the slow permit
and
inspections.
So we work on it.
>> Perfect. Thank you very much,
Izzie. I think that will go a
long way here. So
thanks again and
um I don't have
anything else, Bobby. I appreciate
all your work. Thank you for your
inside and all your willingness to
continue to help us here in New
Mexico. All righty.
And before we go on,
I am going to go back
a little bit and
um uh and have
the staff introduce themselves.
I did not do that
when we introduced ourselves as
members and we have one more member
who walked in first. Can you
go first to introduce yourself in the
regular? Thank
you, chair. >> Um I'm Representative
Kathleen Gates from district
uh 44 and
>> negotiating >> uh this
committee as well as the water
committee on the north side of the
relationship. So I, we
go, all right.
Thank you. >> All right, step.
Let's introduce your to
the sale. So I
I Vasquez, I'm a staff
attorney for the City
council. Thank you,
>> Christine.
I got that
number.
Thank you.
I'm Leo
>> Gonzalez.
That was Madam Daniel
right now with that fa Oh,
ok. All right.
Thank you. Very much. Now,
we need a motion to
approve the minutes that
in your package,
there's a motion by Senator
Nosal and second by
Senator Padilla Hall in
favor. Goodbye by saying I
opposed. Yes,
thank you. All right,
we got minutes done.
Now, we are going
to move on to
housing development plans that
going from housing tax
>> credit. >> Yeah,
there you
are.
You want,
do we have ac that we
can look at? Yes, >> I'm sure uh
on P two
for our presentation.
Thank you.
Two about two.
Yes.
Um Thank you
madam chair. Ok.
Uh Again, my name is
Jeff and I'm the chief
officer for M FAA
with me is Tim
Martinez. He's our health
develop a
supervisor.
He's gonna, I've been
all the easy stuff and he's doing all
of our stuff.
Uh We appreciate the
opportunity to talk to you today. Give
you a little bit of a uh
understanding
of our low income housing
tax credit program
and how it is used
to finance
uh housing
development uh in the
state of
Mexico.
Uh I think Bobby
uh I'm
on, I'm on page
three now. Thank you.
And you, I'm gonna
go through some of this a little bit quickly
and make up some time.
Bobby, talk about
the, the
development process and the
time it takes. There's a slide
here.
Uh Yeah, one back
one. Thank
you.
There's a slide here that just gives a
little bit of information about
the time uh it takes
first for uh
putting together a
project to build a uh
housing community.
Um
but needless to say it
does take time and
uh a lot of preparation
before M fa even sees
the request
application.
Uh Next,
uh I just wanna talk
about what we call
qualifying
allocation
uh plan, which is
the rules
by which we
administer the building
and housing tax credit or
like as, as
it's known. Um
It provides the requirements
to be considered to
receive uh the
credits. It's
reviewed for potential
changes and improvements each
year by
the uh uh
housing Development
Department uh at N
fa
next
slide.
Um Just
to show you the process and
kind of quickly go over
this. M FA
receives
uh input
from developers around the
state, we meet with them
uh each year. Uh
We draft
uh proposals uh
for any changes that we
might feel need to be made to
the qualified
allocation plan of the
QAP. There's
a period uh of
public comment,
we review those comments
and then if we
uh feel there are,
there's a need to make
changes.
The, the uh those
changes are reviewed by our
policy committee at M
FA. Uh
they go to our board's
finance community
and, and finally, they're
presented to the full board of
directors for approval.
Once the board of
directors approves the
QAP, then
it goes to the governor for
a signature
And uh I just want to mention
that we also include
uh uh
members of the governor's
staff um
in the development of
some of these changes.
Uh so that it's the
governor's desperate, it's
uh the uh the
governor's gonna launch as
well.
Um
Next, I just wanted to
talk about
um
the applications
developers to bring in
applications
for uh
tax credits for these
projects as
uh Mister
Gris has talked
about, first of all, we
receive applications,
there's an inter internal
review committee that scores
those applications
comparing it to the
qualified allocation plan
that I just talked about.
Uh There are design requirements.
Uh We have an architectural
uh services representative
on staff here in M FA
who looks up your
plans
and and
design.
There are threshold requirements
that have to not to be
considered as an
application.
Uh Once the uh
internal review committee
supports these applications,
they send the recommendations
to ma policy
committee for approval
of the approval
boards
and then um
to an allocation
review committee
that's uh outside of M
fa
once they approve that it goes
to the board
and uh there is a
time for
potential uh appeals
if any of the developers feel like
uh have a reason
to appeal to this, the
uh decision.
Uh Unfortunately, we have
only so many tax
credits each year.
We usually have more
applications than
we have tax credit.
So there are a few projects that
may not be able to be
awarded. And quite
frequently those uh
projects come back the next
year and uh
seek. Uh
that's correct.
>> Um Well,
>> once those are approved,
those uh applications
and applications are approved,
there are also usually loan
requests that go
along with those uh uh
those projects
and we review those loan
requests
and uh approve
those
the lungs
close,
the projects are
built. And
then the last uh column
now on that screen uh
talks about
monitoring
uh while we talked
about uh our asset
management team, it
goes out for the next
30 or 40 years
and they make sure
that the uh manager
of that property is following
all the requirements
that we put in place when
the uh award was
completed. And that usually
is the
uh income levels of the
occupants, the rent
levels and
the uh the uh
condition of the
property. So we
have a long-term
uh way of monitoring
those projects.
Now, I'm gonna turn over
the next few slides
to Tim. He's gonna talk a
little bit about some of the
costs and other uh
issues. So, >> so
you guys may not be wanting that
chair. They
get my much. He has had any
has that has
been uh
so you just talk a lot about the
process or how products are put
together and how that
that program is
a that like to draw
your attention more to public
cost production data
for that program.
Start with the most historical data
over the last 10 years
to three different points in
time. So
first you'll see that in terms of the average
size of products and work
x-rays. The uh variation
here is dable from 2014
to 2024
an average of about 60 units per
product. Um
Typically we see that the street
products range between about
3100 and they say this is a
surprising number.
Um And that's what the product,
the fact that uh the smaller
products
a little bit louder if you
can. Sure,
thank you
louder.
Yeah, the, the
smaller projects typically
require a relatively more
equity and are good
candidates.
So you see that the number of
what tax rates in the annual
real has increased
since 2019.
This is really showing that fewer
products have been work.
Um And this is ultimately directly
related to the construction
costs are also gonna increase
across the nation since the onset
of COVID-19. And of
course, the State of New Mexico is
no exception.
So essentially as development
costs have increased the
tax rate and equity needed for a
project to become financially
feasible. Also increases
and therefore we're seeing fewer
viable applications
to fewer rewards and
uh fewer gains
through in the next
row. Uh You will see
related increases in the average
tax rate, equity enter a
project which would be
expected that would
increase costs.
So higher cost has paid
more tax rate. Equity which
was divided see
increase for
development cost per unit. You
see the same challenges
in 2014 in
2019 cost
to construct a single unit change
their little. Whereas from
2019 to 2024
to see a $100,000
increase in the average cost of
R
and the last road
or total development cost for
project and the same
thing. So we the normal levels of
inflation from 2014
to
2019
and then a dramatic increase in whole
developing cost from
2019 to
2000.
So moving on to the next
slide
after we is graphically breaking
down the production data from the
previous slide by process type
from 2014,
2024.
So you have new construction in
new acquisition
below. So
here we see that while production clearly
has dropped, the number of new
reconstruction bands has decreased
at a slower pace through a
provision of all application
plan requires
two new construction projects to
be avoided for every
one.
So you can especially see that comes to
effect between 2019
and 2024 where
new construction units um
produce uh drop
by roughly 50 units.
So uh even though it's difficult
to make light
at that to
drop, 100 and 50 units
produce, uh there is some
pos considering
circumstances that uh the
newly produced because of new
housing stock hasn't
taken.
Um So on the next slide,
moving away now, uh briefing
away from tax
credits,
I'm hearing that maybe you
to slow down the gist of
only because I think several
of us are losing you. I know
you're trying to get through a lot of information,
a lot of
information
if you can't
that. Thank you.
So, on this slide, I just want
to get a high level overview
of how the paid by all of
these products.
So because 9%
tax credits only to get a rid of that,
we on up with 7% of
projects, there's always
inherently a money gap.
Uh which is also why I did
this several gap
program help those
in.
So the three primary
programs to utilize the tax trade
bills are the United Housing
Trust Fund Home,
which is a federal program and
the National Housing Trust Fund, which is
also a federal program
and, and each
uh
dark, I'm
sorry,
is
that
so while I'm trying to
pull this back up here,
um again, what we're
looking at here are different debts and
programs and administrative
events. Mexico has Trust
fund all and
National Housing Trust
Fund. Thank you. I
appreciate
that.
So um
we starting with the new Mexico having
trust fund here that's currently
offers a low interest only
advertising loan, so
it does require principal and interest
payments. Um And that
would be of course, so we can continue to
recycle those funds back in the
program and to grow the fund
for future awards.
Uh This program is currently limited
to $3 million per
project during the construction
period and it is paid
down to $2 million during
the permanent period and
that permanent term can be as long
as 40 years to help keep
those things low. And
uh depending on the nature of the project,
interest rates can vary
between one and 3%
which is of course a much lower
department.
But if necessary, it does have
the will to uh
underwrite a loan as high as
5% depending on how
much
it
abased home funds are much more limited
than the next 100 trust fund.
So we offer those at a maximum
of $400,000 for 20%
tax-free projects,
$800,000 for
4% tax credit projects.
And the rationale there is
4% tax-free products
have a significantly larger
fund tax.
If the product developer is an
approved nonprofit
causing to develop a position
and qualify for up to $1
million.
And I'll add that uh just this last
week based on ones availability,
you know, they actually increase those limit
by 20% across the
home.
Is also a long term for a
loan. So that turns like 40
years in some cases,
you know, they will allow pains based
on a year immunization
to help reduce those pains in
further
for home rate is
0%. So pays our
principal home.
And lastly, we have
national as a trust fund,
which is also a much more constrained
source in Mexico as a trust
fund, especially since
these funds are allocated annually
by public based on population
size. So for
9% tax credit projects, we
offer bills up to
$400,000 per
project. And for 4%
tax credit projects, we offer up
to $1,500,000.
The major difference with National
Housing Trust Fund these loans, what
we call soft financing.
So although there is a term and
affordability restriction of at least
30 years, there
is no interest rate.
Payments are fixed at over
$500 annually
or based bill cash flow
uh which is essentially any
residual income. Uh
The probably generates a
high.
So national housing funds,
a grant
structure
on this next
slide,
it's expanding on the uh various
funding sources. So
here he's visualizing all the
necessary funding that we finance
9% tax project
uh showing on average
how that data has changed over
the last 10 years.
So in order to become financially
feasible, uh these projects and
finance, it is
often which together make
up what we call capital
stack. Typically,
products have a conventional first
mortgage loan which you'll see
in the light blue bar,
in the tax credit,
equity in the dark blue
bar. And then multiple
sources of what we call
subordinate financing
including gap financing
programs that I
discovered.
So here we see that over the past
10 years, the percentage of the
capital staff covered by a
conditional loan initially
increased from 13 to
17% and then
decreased to 9% in
2021.
So what we're seeing here is the
amount of conventional financing
available to the product. It's
one thing depending on how much
cash flow the property generates,
but also interest rates rer
the impact size
bank.
Um So what you see here is that
um in these last few
years, the dramatic
increase in interest rates has
affected the side of the first
mortgage and the average
projects, you know, essentially
have more gaps as a
result
in 2024
home and National Health and Trust
Fund mine and they
provided up to two
financing
project again.
And if they receive relatively
small annual allocations
from us, and in the case of
National Housing Trust Fund,
they generally only qualify
over $3 million annually.
Is a small
amount.
Home funds are also allocated based
on population. Uh And
from 2014 to
2019 home
comprise 2%
costs and a decrease
to 1% in
2004.
And that's simply because as project
costs have increased, the available
funding remains the same.
So, inherently, those federal sources
cover proportionately less
the total fund cost than they
want to.
And looking at the change here in the
percentage of state funding.
Uh what I really like to point out in
Black here is that the
increase in New Mexico has a trust
fund uh resulting from the
separate tax fund funding in the
last two years has really
made a, a major
impact in
2024. New Mexico
has a trust fund. They have 10%
of the average cost
whereas it represented less than
2% of 2014,
2019, but
only capital
housing transformation.
So those ones um those
clear ears uh were spread
much there.
So the point being that in today's
environment, Mexico trust
fund is really become a critical
resources
to financing that amount of
funds.
So looking at this uh
force to be able to provide
all the resources necessary
to find the remaining costs for
projects. Um So
developers will for some
of the developer fee may
2 to 3% of the total
development cost.
Basically by not immediately
taking the entire
fee,
you would be incrementally paid
off um by cash
flow at some point where
you're the
operation
because of the dollar fee is a
capitalized expense. Umer as
a funding
source payment.
So
And lastly here,
developers also seek out
other leverage for possible
which you'll see in the darker yellow
bar. They tend to be
more uh resources in
larger markets perhaps with more
usable funding. But we do
also see some examples of
recent history. Actually, this
last year, the do
over closely the developer,
you can find a million
dollars and the land
was and that was critical
to the financial case of
that project. Um
Historically, what appears to be
happening is again, the
other resources haven't necessarily
grown on average but cost
half. And now those
sources cover a small portion
of the whole body
costs
on the next
slide.
So obviously, costs are a
major theme of in this
current housing landscape.
So this graft just breaks down the
cost of new construction projects by
different categories.
Again, you'll see the construction
costs per unit has dramatically
increased. So this
category would include things like
material costs and labor
has been for seizure, but the
dark blue represents
2024 costs
with the light blue and yellow represents
2014 and
uh 2019
respectively.
Also noteworthy is that
financing other soft costs,
which would include architectural
uh fees, engineering, environmental
costs, things of that nature
and also substantially
increase. And of
course, uh the increase in construction
loan interest rates have a
large impact on financing
costs.
And lastly, you can see that
developer fees actually decreased
in 2000. Uh after
2024
which will stand on uh and
publicized and talk more
about uh developer fees
and operating reserves and have
also increased.
And for context on those M
fa currently requires
reserves that will cover a sixmonth
period of that service
and operations. Should any
unforeseen
additional?
And on this next
slide,
I just wanna touch on the uh
income and operating uh characteristics
of affordable housing,
especially driving on the point, the
tax credits inherently require
subsidy because they generate
net operating.
Umur
typically the majority of the
products rent are restricted at
60% of area
income or less and
additional rents cannot exceed
30% of the
month.
So all of these projects are
income restraint, they still in
cooperatives and they
see loss assumptions that are on par
market rate projects uh
which of course
prevents.
So if you're factoring in those expenses,
you come up with your life,
which would inherently be lower
or the tax
credit.
So during the application, you can use
both uh phase rather both
for tax credits and any M
fa loans staff will analyze
the process income and expense
projections and see how
cash flow is over a 15 year
period. In
other words, we look at the process proforma
to see how the project performs
and cover the staff
over
time
during the underwriting phase. And
it requires that at least 20%
of that A O I is left as
cushion after paying
all annual heart debt.
So in other words, that 20%
cushion results in a 1.2.
So one debt coverage
ratio
and maintaining that debt coverage
ratio of 1.2
15 years of operation is
for me of
health.
And with that being said, we also have
an obligation of course to
ensure the project
is not over subsidized,
which would mean if the project cash flow
too well and that's not
assit subsidy
in the.
So what we look for the contract
maintains that 1.2 to
1 debt service recover ratio
that does not exceed a
1.4 to 1 debt
service ratio in the 1st
15 years of
operation.
Moving on to
adulteries
here, we're just looking at um how
develop these have been calculated
over the last 10 years. So
again 2014,
19 and
2024
earlier, I had mentioned that
developer be have decreased
and that's largely due to how they are
currently
calculated.
In 2014, developer
fees were populated as a
percentage of the total development
cost. This means
the more costly the project,
the higher it be.
But in 2018,
the National Council State
Housing Agencies or N
CS H A
recognized that this developer
being at all incentivized
increasing project costs.
So they updated their recommended
practices to allow lesser
a certain amount limit or
15% of the total
development cost at
the Mexico
did enact this recommendation in
2019,
whereby the project size
dictated how many dollars
per pay
all
then in 2022.
And that they recognized that this
methodology was paying a smaller
fee for building
a, a larger Cron in some cases.
So for example, there would
be 61 units would
produce a less of fee
than 60 units.
So now moving in 2024
the developer fee is now based on a
set amount per unit up to
30 years. So that would start at
$23,000 per
unit to start plus
a smaller amount per unit
for the next 30 units and so
on graduating down to a
minimum of $18,000
per year.
So this most recent change uh
in a way that developer fees are
calculated resulted in
far less than 15% of the
total developer costs being
treated to that fee.
So the average fidelity in
2024 is actually
6.1% over
9%
C
um one cabinet I'll point out
is that the 4% taxes
and bond profits continue
to earn their we fee based on a
percentage of their we
costs.
And that's because the products don't
receive as much dollar that
value as the 9%
tax rate balance.
In those cases, the increase in
developer fee actually allows the
project to receive more tax
credit and to cover
the cost of development
since the uh developer fee is
actually part of the eligible cost
that are used to calculate the tax
credit
continuing on and
develop these. Since the
next
here, we're looking at a comparison
of abased developer fee,
Caribbean from far
left versus a sample
of 11 other states.
So last year N fa uh
researched developer fees.
And so as a comparer
uh to most of the other states that
also based their fees on units
built rather than a percentage
of costs. And
as you can see when calculating
fee for both a 65
unit project and a 100
unit project, Mexico
speed is higher than six of
the 11 states. We also like
to all of those ac a shape
conditions
so that more or less places in New
Mexico in the region
among those states that
a in a uh certainly
invested in understanding how
to compare against other states
and following reasonable
conventions. We also
understand that because the economic
value of these projects does
not lie in their income
potential. Um That
developer fee incentive is
critical if you want to
track afford housing developers
to Mexico rather than use
those opportunities to
risk. And with
that, I will pass it back to you to
uh the presentation.
>> Thank you. Make
sure.
Just to, just to wrap this
up, I just wanted to spend a couple
of minutes on single family
development. We talked about
multi family so far.
Um And M
has been trying
to uh
allocate more resources to
single family development.
Uh We've been talking
to developers for the last couple
of years and
uh what has uh happened
is we finally have had
some development
projects that have just been
approved uh one
recently in Boswell
and uh the other in
Taos. And we've got
another uh project
that's uh uh working
its way through the process,
the application process
that would be in
the out of county
area. Um
We, we can provide low
interest rate uh loans
to developers to, to
develop
single-family
um
homes on the
last slide of
presentation.
Um It just kind of shows you
what uh interfacing
family development l you can
do, we can lend
to create a building
lots uh by providing
loans for infrastructure,
sewer, water and roads.
We can also provide
uh low uh
interest rate loans for
home construction
so that uh
we can help lower the
costs. And
then we can also uh
provide mortgage
financing for the
homebuyers to buy these
loans uh with
the loan interest rates and
downpayment assistance,
which is how are
two types of
loans, the infrastructure,
home construction loans
get paid off. So
we're very uh encouraged
by the fact that we have
more
single-family development
projects uh
underway in the state
of Mexico for uh
affordable housing.
And with that, uh
we're
be able to answer your question.
Thank you, >> Jeff. All right.
Uh Representative
Kate
>> San,
I Thank you here and thank
you for your presentation. It always
so exciting to
be updated by M
fa. I have a series
of questions but I promise
there are one or two word
answers. So I'm
hoping or what you were
just talking about,
it might be too early in the game.
But the legislature just uh
recently in the past
session um uh
pass
funding to
provide that infrastructure
for the developers to come in
and build single-family
uh units.
And especially if they
are a geared to a certain
um occupations
such as like teachers or, and,
and in Roswell and
Donna Anna, I know that that's very
much needed
when M fa is able
to work on such a project
where the
the state funding
is paying for the infrastructure
and that they may be able to
help with the developer
to make sure that we,
we know when that is
happening
um cause that hasn't happened
yet. >> Correct, Mister Chair
representative, we,
we are uh in
talks and we're collaborating
with the finance for,
for their use of these funds
and infrastructure. So we
hope once the program is up
and running that we can collaborate,
they can use their funds for
intru we can use up
for >> else I saying I
look forward to that update
um at the very beginning of your
presentation. Thank you
that
centers um you
said that uh that there
are a certain amount that are
not uh
funded
or I think it was a tax
break at the beginning that
they will reapply
for the following year. Is
there a criteria
process where they're
prioritized
because they miss funding
I know in and that they have
such a prior
to
do you have that sort of
process?
>> Chair representative,
we look at all the
applications uh
and rate them on
the approved
criteria that they need to
meet. But uh our
staff works with those
uh developers to make
sure to help them to know
what things they need
to uh adjust or
change so that they,
so that they understand
uh what needs to
happen for them to be
successful. >> Thank
you and Mister Martinez, last
question you mentioned, thank you for your
indulgence.
Um Is
uh we, you talked
about um
inspections.
So I'm asking
who is and how
often are we monitoring
the conditions
of the buildings
periodically?
Who's monitoring
them? Are they certified
as, as we talked about
in, in the previous presentation,
you know, building inspectors
opposed to
um you know,
like hut inspectors.
Uh And so
how often are we doing
it? And um
and who, what is the
criteria who's doing the
monitoring?
>> Sure. So uh
I share that case.
Um so as definition earlier
in the presentation,
eventually we c
those,
those are ain the heart,
that part is through
the
project speaking, what they're
looking at that
for
um from the stuff condition
of the property. Uh We do
have a architectural
that our
staff who it
does have the ability to go out to
look as far
as how often um
pain in
on uh which firms
are involved in that particular property
as far as the tax credit program,
I probably advise on
program manager. She is here.
She might have some more details
into the, let's
see.
>> Thank you. So that is a, a
very good
the answer. Go ahead.
Yeah. So um architecture
service representative
um reviews all the
plans initially
before they start and he has
to give permission,
um, for them to start based
on their plans
are acceptable
and they need a lot Cacia
and then they do a minimum
of three inspections
or the 33 >> percent, one is
66%. And what I
find >> and then
the long-term
monitoring is
done at least every three
years. Um, if there
is a reason to go out
for >> offering's could be
issues that we
have to have to go out
and monitor the property.
This is a long term
compliance. Um More
often to try to >> system,
to get them back on
board. But
ultimately, um in general,
it's once every three years
of the catch.
Thank you so much.
So, these are the properties that
are long-term, they're usually
those are rental properties.
So that's what we want to be
able to monitor the
conditions that when
you, when you have that high turnover.
I just like to bring it to this
committee's and then I'll be done.
This committee's attention. It
has been brought to my attention that
Clyde has suspended
all their
inspections
and the
uh Greater
Albuquerque area for
this year. Um So
if you're part of Section eight housing
or other kinds of housing where it's
just have funded,
um there are
no physical
inspections for >> this
year
on that
point
that
uh availability,
folks who need sexually
health
or,
or
>> ensuring that the
housing that is available
is adequate
and in working condition.
>> No others would
have.
Yes. Thank you very much for that.
And, um, Izzy, I know
that you, you've been touched
very closely,
um, as, as much
as you can, we've had
on the section eight programs
and so on. Although we know we don't
have a lot of authority with respect
to there regulations. We
talked about that.
But um, uh can
you check into that because that is
concerning if that's the case
and see if there's any response we
can get from.
I'm sure we will definitely get a
all the hut and find out. I can
tell you that for the Section
eight vouchers,
those are not managed directly by
hut, they're managed by the public
housing authorities or the regional
housing authorities. And it's
the step of those entities that
goes out and does the inspection of
the units to ensure
that they meet the HQ S
requirements before they have a 10
to move in. Uh And
I know Bobby has recent
experience in the shakings. I don't here
with regard to how not doing
inspections anymore. Bobby, I'm
not commenting
on that. I I just want to
be clear madam chair
representative
checks
the project based section
eight
is different than the
vouchers. So how
does not stop the project
based Section eight? I can guarantee
that they're my problems.
Also. In addition to what
Tim was talking about, we
have our tax credit investors
who inspect our properties every
year not just M fa
and if we're hud they
inspect the property every year
and if we're USDA
rural development they
inspect. So we have,
we have multiple
agencies that inspect
affordable housing. I want
to be clear that the project
based section eight
is there are inspections of
one. That's thank
you so much. Thank you.
So that's better
than. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Yeah.
All righty. We're gonna
go on to Senator Ortiz
P. Thank you madam chairman.
Thank you for the
information. I just a
couple of quick questions. Make
sure I understand
um developer
fees, what's
encompassed in that is that
profit and
all administrative
costs either than that
or what is developed.
So madam chair and
you know, so the developer piece
is not necessarily this
is a sort of different
element of the pro that you see
in single family development where there is a
certain uh profit that
you can make on the project.
Um This is really a
fee for managing the
project and bringing into fruition
and getting those things on the ground and
successfully keep
contact. And of course,
as we were talking about, every state
has a slightly different way
calculating those. Um
and uh the one I covered with the
some of our conditions, uh
both from the 9% around
4% 5 as
well,
but there is a profit
involved.
So we would do it
just the
profit for the problem with the tax
credit products really is in
that development. It,
it doesn't look quite the same
way uh like
that, we we as high.
So the incentive
to develop for
has really is
that, is that process is
that it is getting that develop
at that roughly
6.1% of the total
development. So the
cost of the project is what's really
driving uh how
much
uh again, these
properties aren't really uh
not driven by
they mutual.
So uh the cash flow from the
property uh isn't really
the incentive wal
that
it is the total project
cost,
correct?
So the but is
isn't that in some ways
perverse? I mean, it,
there's no reason to try to get
more coughs like
you more
coughs you get.
So we, we did change
that provision at one point in time.
So if you look back in
2014,
in fact, I can find
a, find a here.
Oh, that's good.
Yeah, you look back in
2014.
So um that would
be slide
number
mm age
14.
So in 2014, uh
that was absolute the case. Basically,
we were encouraging increased cost.
And I think across the board, that
convention changed across the
nation again because the
N CS H A put
out a recommendation saying this is,
this is backwards as what you're saying.
So we did start to adjust that
at all by 2019
and by now by
2024. That,
that calculation is based
more on implements of how many
units you get. So you're
really, what you're looking at is
the bigger product you
build more units around
the greater
the
um Then the other question
I have madam chairman has
to do with you gave us
great information on the 9%
low income tax
credits and,
and, and uh
and those, those
bars and,
and, but I didn't see
any similar or the
production, I didn't
see anything similar to
4%. Do they parallel
or is there some reason you didn't
give us 4%?
So I think that the focus
of this presentation, you want to book an
annual round,
I'm certain that we have all the
same information for the for
arm as well. Our, our uh
rather
as well. I'm sure we can get
that historical data for you.
Um I would suspect right
at the top of my head that you'll see similar
trends. Um However,
some of the uh financials
interplay with the contract will
change.
So, and, and just one last
question to make sure I understand the
those bars are
graphs on page
10.
I may not be able to
tell the difference in colors
well enough, the,
the bottom, uh
let's
say
on each of them that dark
turquoise, whatever color
that that is. Yes.
Is that the
low income housing tax
credit? Precisely
Manager Center,
that dark blue
color there representing the tax
for the is generated
from test and
your basic essential going
a million 9%
doesn't change. Exactly.
Probably will cover 70%
or, uh, maybe less than
70%
job. And,
and then the, the other one I, I didn't
understand was the other
leverage, which I
guess is the brown
one. Sure.
That's sort of tan color. Um,
so there are absolutely
the leverage there. It's just
any other funding comes to this
product. It's not a personal, it's
not a, it's not
a, it could be a
grat. Um it could
be a HP Brandt.
So other other types of
lenders if you subsidize
loans, things of that
nature. So that's, that's really
kind of why you see that
blood
premal but, and I don't,
I, I can't identify all
of it. Like
maybe need to make that
so small. Exactly.
So is actually a relatively
small loan that we have
here. It's the construction finance
company. So it really
doesn't make as big they have
as programs, which
is why we really kind of try to narrow
in on at home
National Health Trust
legi
the big takeaway
is
um
the role that the housing Trust
fund is playing.
Absolutely is absolutely
a lack there in 2024.
Um Absolutely.
Uh Essentially what you see is
if you fill the gap
absolutely of increase the first
mortgage um sizes
and basically what you're seeing
is possible going on
that
Rodriguez that good
work once
again,
we have that
together. Thank you.
>> All right, >> we move
on to San Rosar and then we have
a
thank
you.
And we mentioned that it seems
like that.
What is that?
A web chair and
uh Senator, it, it
is
uh on the south end of the
town, it's called Salazar
South. It's
uh
not, not too far from
where the uh
yeah, where the
realtor's offices are.
If you don't know this,
I don't know, I don't have a physical
address.
Universities,
we do try to find
cross are,
thank
you.
You have.
So
there's an office
complex uh
down south end of town with
the Doctors
Association
uh outside the
office.
I'm sure the right
time or maybe they've moved
since I was up there.
Apologize.
All right.
Uh
to more out
fine.
Thank you, Senator representable.
But
um, so
on page seven, you guys
talk about the cost
of construction
and since 2014
to 2024
and you know, during the COVID
construction cost
went up quite a bit and
it seems to me like it
doubled. Is that
correct?
What you're showing in
your?
So I
share
um
essential
representative.
So if, if you're talking about in
2014 to 2024
that 10 year period line, then
maybe that
not quite doubling um
but significantly
increasing. I think the real
number that you wanna look at is that
2019 24?
Um that's over a
$100,000 increase
per
mm madam
chair. Um
So
up here
and you're, I, I don't know,
they pay.
I know um
how many of your
projects um
involve
uh government
land
or property
that has been donated to
you do
any level
representative. Um Awful
times you'll see that. Um
As far as what percentage >> using
history, >> it is difficult for me to Acertain
that at the moment. But um
very contagious. You
have your case. You
brown was or your
actually donated land,
right? Or donated.
What about the important? The
low counts are
those are
are government
only.
We honestly don't see many
of the hotel conversions. I
don't know that I can speak to any
particular project. This uh
it's of that nature.
Um I believe you
involving speaking.
Uh you that find
a Tasco a lot
of,
I raised that question
because um
a lot of projects >> to
>> Egypt in the
city of Albuquerque,
um Albuquerque, I
um Bel Trade Post.
I'm just gonna give you some examples,
sawmill. Um
Those are, those are,
those properties are
owned by the, by the
city in most
cases, uh some,
all the counties.
Um And so the
properties were,
you know, don
basically.
And so that's why
I'm, I'm, I'm raising the question
and maybe Sonya
has a better
um idea about this
cause he's on the task force,
but it seems to be
notter we really
should do
some sort of a
um a vacant
land survey to
see what properties
the the state
owns statewide.
So that we can have an understanding
of where we could strategically
look at
building
uh new
property, you know, new
housing
development. And
also, and I, I know
this is really a lot harder
to do with a vacant building
survey.
Um so that we
would have a better handle.
I, I think on this committee
as to how we can
help
um
uh busy in
terms of, you
know, looking at
communities that really,
I mean, everybody's in need.
Yes, but to
see strategically
where it makes
sense to build higher
density developments.
So I just wanted to clear that
out because
um I know the
task force the governor put
together that may be something
that, that we wanna
or I don't know if you've
done.
Thank you. Thank you very much
for that. Um And I don't
recall that that
went into land surveys or
anything like that for
that test. But yeah,
but they're very good questions because
I was just thinking that when you
mentioned that perhaps
um through um Izzy
maybe working with the General
Services department initially,
I thought representative, they were
talking about state lands when you
mentioned that meeting state land
office. No, this is more
buildings, land of
that. Is there maybe
possible man,
maybe to make generate,
I can clarify that. Um
It's, it's looking at
properties that are
within
um cities
or towns that
are just vacant and the state
owns them and are just
kind of sitting there.
Um that
would be
potential
um properties
for development. Sure.
And I think that would be
within the general services
department uh for the
state. So is he perhaps,
I think it's a very good question
representative. Thank you for that
suggestion. You can
check into that. Thank you if you
can briefly elaborate for
time. Yeah, that the,
the
the chair. >> So
over the past few years, we
have had
>> two properties in
the 5% of this
program
>> that we developed a state
land on this
land. Um
Another problem this
past year
um the Village
Doone donated,
um but he's leasing the
land for the property
there. And
the um
city's development
Agency
provided the land
um they had to, to pay
on to buy it
for so parts
which is the,
so we do see
um that they
be used
throughout the program.
>> It's >> usually >> mainly
under control. Um
And now, sure, I totally
accept that. I'm just saying
that it would be who
us to have a
statewide
um assessment
of where these vacant
lands are.
Ok. And what
jurisdictions they're in.
And then, um the
state may wanna look
at donating those
to a room
that could develop them. I
mean, it's not actually
donating them, but there's
a process that's involved.
And is he using the process?
And I do um
that eventually, if they do
certain things and meet
certain milestones in their
contract, eventually
that property will be
turned
over.
Thank you. Thank you very much
for that. We did get the clarification
representative and I
think it's a good idea, but I
do think it's imperative
that we work together with the General
Services department and
to see what they have, they may already
be doing something that's
underway here. But just
as a, a notation here is
that any time that we
request um
a additional surveys
statewide specifically
and otherwise from
departments, the
request comes in for
appropriations
to be able to do that. Uh
Just to, so I mentioned
that just so that we can be
prepared to hopefully
allocate some uh
appropriation if need be
for the department and
collaboration that
work on. I just don't
like to continue
to issue unfunded mandates
because they don't get done and
kind of feel good situations
we do, but we never see a result in that.
So I'd rather just do out
of care. Actually, I was thinking
about
2021
session is that we
can actually do a bill
that hires a
contractor to go and do that
statewide. So that's
really what my
is. So, and, and I think
that in checking with the General Services
Department, they may already be
doing it. So I wanna make sure we check
on into that and work
with them because that is what
they do. They keep track
of building
and state buildings and lands and
stuff to make it or could be
leased or uh, so
on. But thank you very much for
that. Good point. All righty.
Did you have another
appointment? All
righty. So, um,
I think so far
I don't have anyone
else here, so I'm
going to move to the
next item. Thank you, Jeff. Thank
you, Tim for your work.
And we're gonna go on
to New Mexico Browsing Trust
Fund up today. Drin. You
are
it
probably
yes.
>> In my chair,
members of the committee, we're starting
on count three, which
is number four on the agenda.
Sorry, it will be uh
the little
minutes up there.
I'll just go through a quick
update of the medical
test done and be happy to
answer any questions.
Um We'll briefly
talk about the history although I
think a lot of this has been covered
statutory requirements,
um, the funding framework
and the impact that we
hope to have with this
funding
on t on flight
three. We just kind
of give a little bit of background
about where we have come.
Um for with New Mexico
Housing Trust Fund was
established in 2005
and up through uh
July of
2022 we
received um,
61
million dollars
um in appropriations
to the housing trust
fund then,
um, there was a big influx,
um beginning in
2023.
Um,
the jumps from
61 to
100 and $83
million that have been
appropriated.
Um, we
started receiving our
2.5%
severance tax
bond in
2024
and we received our sec uh
2023 excuse me, and
our second allocation beginning
this year in uh state
fiscal year
2025.
So, so far we've
received um a little
over uh
almost uh $70
million of severance tax
on funding. And
then, um also
beginning in state
fiscal year 25
we received the largest one
time ever appropriation
through the budget
um of $50
million. So
historically, um as we
sort of talked about,
the Housing Trust fund was
really um
directed to housing
development, directed towards that
gap financing
that uh Tim and Jeff
talked about with
additional funding. We've really been
able to um
add additional
programs and um
provide different
types of
um this
flexible funding for
things like weatherization,
down payment assistance
and other uh programs
that uh that M fa
administers.
So, slide four, I
think this
uh I'm sorry,
slide three.
really paints a
picture of where we
came and
uh where we are as of
this year, just
with uh with the
allocation that we've received.
And we do appreciate
um the work of the legislature
and uh the governor in
providing this
amount of funding.
Um, moving
on to the next
one. We'll just list it
out here the statutory
requirements.
Um, since a large portion
of our funding is through the
severance tax bonds,
they are,
um,
we do need to use
the funding for projects that are
capital in nature. We need,
um, sticks
and bricks rather than operational
funding. Uh, the
statute also requires that
we leverage the funding
for every $1 state
funding. We need to bring in at
least $3 of
additional funding
and all um
funding is subject to
the Affordable Housing Act,
which means that it says that they
need to serve low and moderate
income household and
it is subject to
affordability uh
periods uh for
any dollar that goes into a
property, an
affordability pro uh
an affordability period comes
into play.
Currently, the new Mexico
Health Trust Fund rules define
low and moderate income is up to
150%
of
ami
on the next slide,
um we
have a breakdown of leverage,
you know, historically, we've
had leverage of
up to 27
$28 to every
$1. I think
this housing development
um competition that we just
heard really demonstrated
how much
more state funding we
put into housing development
over the last several years.
So it has brought that
leverage ratio down
a bit. We continue
to part statutory
requirements. Um
And we're
just glad to have a
funding source that can sort
of close the gap especially
for um
construction projects.
Housing development projects
that require
additional gap financing
coming out of the pandemic.
And uh we have that resource
available to bring
those projects Toru
wish
on the next side.
Um
We talk about um
the strategic impact area
and the certified juices and
also the activities that
MF administers.
So as the committee is
aware, M fa
um
developed and
mission, the,
the uh housing
strategy and
that is kind of a guide
for prioritizing
what needs to happen across
the state. Um
Those strategic areas
are, are listed there in that
middle po and
so M fa is
using the strategy to inform
funding level and
allocations
to uh work for
us to create more housing,
to develop and preserve
existing housing and to provide
stable housing environment
to create
stable housing environments.
So then uh we just listed
there in the activities, the different
programs where
state funding is
being um infused
to try and
meet these strategic
goals
on our next slide.
Um This is the
impact that
this funding is having.
This is the initial
allocation that we received
for state that's for
25 4, which is
$37.5
million. Um
And we need this so
far might be
that, but it's about
3500
household families
um and created
um
opportunities for people
who are down
assistance to
uh homeowner as
well as funding
rental development,
single-family development,
reservation programs,
weatherization.
Um and also um
some other programs
that sort of try to fill
the gap. And
earlier, um you had
asked about where
the funding um
was being allocated.
Uh And I think on the next
slide, excuse me, for
20
for our 2025
allocation, we
um
we allocated about
$13 million.
Uh I'm sorry, $10
million
to project
those um
are located one in
Albuquerque called
uh su's Apartments
is located in the
international district.
Uh 22
awards are made for Santa Fe,
one for Ate
and one for Country Club.
And those are both rehabilitation
projects. And
then we allocated
um funding from
the $50 million
appropriation to single
family development that
was mentioned in Roswell
and to so we're seeing a
statewide uh
impact uh from
the funding as
well.
So who, who was the >> developer
of the International District
Clinic?
Senator? >> You know,
that's the one piece of
information I know
>> have have
that. >> I think it's almost,
I think it's uh
>> and I made off of the uh
of the partnership that changed
this almost. Uh So they change
their names.
OK.
Yes.
>> And then the last slide that uh I'll
draw your attention to is
a slide eight
that um
outlines how we've
allocated the
at the uh both
the severance tax on funding
will take this whole year
2025
and the uh appropriation
of $50
million.
And we got
all.
>> Thank you, Rob.
Good work and presentation.
Always very

of the agency
uh with the, they're the one that develop
the so so
developed so. OK.
All right. Thank you. Is it
close up?
All right.
I'm sorry. I think they did a
presentation chart.
>> Yeah,
>> that
thank you. All right. We're
gonna move on to statewide health
needs assessment. So,
yeah. Um
You're Nauru, did I pronounce it
correctly? All right.
OK. Thank you. And
Stephanie Gonzalez
is
and last and
members of the food are
item five on the agenda with
the top
four
next five
week
on the side, the
cover areas
by health and
these are created
or um they're from
the New Mexico Health
Track. The New Mexico
housing strategy to lead the
state, New Mexican,
local government, private
and nonprofit partners for the
highest impact
or strategy areas highlighted
office spot. It was
created to address the housing market
that some increasingly
difficult for all of our highest
income in Mexican history
award
to the Portland New Mexico Housing
Strategy. An advisory committee
was formed to share their
knowledge and expertise in
bily meeting and participate
in districts and
areas. In addition,
I'm happy to report that the housing
strategy was informed
by a resident survey that experience
in 14
years.
This having uh the statewide
housing need has come to cover
four of the five
strategic areas
up on the
side.
I would just like to have the methodology
of the A
assessment. The methodology
centers on that data
from the most recent United
States Census Bureau of
American Community Survey.
In addition M fa staff,
the data from the US
census building permit survey
of annual home
assessment report and the New
Mexico Association
authorities.
Next slide
please.
First, I want to just cover
a brief demographic
profile of New Mexico
and that is like
53 label
53.
However, page 34
over all. My
first, we'll look at the demographics
of the state of New Mexico and this
will demonstrate your need of the state,
especially where it pertains
specifically to have
in the Southwester region of the co
country. New Mexico is trailing
behind the neighboring states like
Oklahoma, Arizona,
Colorado, Texas,
Nevada, and Utah.
And these most notably
see the largest increase.
The poverty rate in New
Mexico is 5.80%
higher than the national
average. As you can
see in the chart on
uh the slide, New
Mexico is at 18.3%
poverty rate
and this is 5.8%
higher than the national
rate.
Next slide,
please.
Still looking at New
Mexico at home.
Now
profile
on this side, you're looking at the
income ranges of senior households,
specifically household
with one or more people,
65 years and
older.
It is important to consider the
economic unity in the state of New
Mexico will discuss in the house
out. New Mexico is
home to a large rate of senior
households or households
with one more people. 65
and older. This group of
the population has grown significantly
most likely due to its milder
climate and low
lower living costs compared to the rest
of the country. The rate of the
household for seniors in New Mexico
is almost three times the rate
of national average.
As you can see, the nationwide
rate is below and a half
percent. And New Mexico is
currently sitting at
33
but New Mexicans in your household
are low uh to
moderate income with
41.8%
earning less than
$40,000.
This compares to the
national rate of
37.7%.
Next slide,
please
continuing with the
economic compile. We now
get New Mexico households
by income range based
on the housing strategy, the state
productive jobs
or roughly 84,000
jobs between the creation of the
strategy and
2035
the vast majority is
71% are low
to market home wage
industries, and
hospitality, education
and health services. These
workers are unlikely to be able
to afford to buy and
will have difficulty renting
safe high urban
markets. The
graph on the slide focuses on the
range of New Mexico households.
As you can see the household that
range, the ranges
typically have a lower income range
and those who own their own
less than half the state
need under $50,000
annually and have to
the majority of
renters.
Interestingly, the state's
hormonal rate is 6.1%
higher than the national
rate.
Rents in New Mexico like
the rest of the nation are more likely to
be the low income compared to
their home
conference.
Next slide
please.
First, we now we'll look
at building home ownership and
we which is the first strategic
impact area.
First and foremost in the
mortgage industry, the general
rule is that no more
than 30% of the monthly
household income should go to have
cost in the state of
New Mexico. The average monthly
income is sitting
at about
4895
$94.30
percent of this household income.
It would be
$1468.
Currently, the average
sale price of a home in New Mexico
is
$323,320.
Putting the monthly mortgage
at $2660.
This payment consumes
58% of the monthly
household income, taking
homeownership there ando
versus
mortgage.
As you can see this graph
from 2015 to
2023. The
median sale price of the home
has increased from
$200,000
to $323,000
to
$323,230.
Got
on the next slide. Slide
seven,
you're still on moving a
motion
on this side, we compare the year
over year change and vegan household
income at a medium whole
price
in the last four years. The median
household income increased
22.2%
while the median home price
increased 50
in this high interest rate environment.
And couple of inflation,
the lack of growth and income
is making homeownership that
much more
difficult.
As >> you >> can see >> in this
graph, uh
>> the median home price
jumps in 2020
but and then reduced in
2021 but >> it's still steadily
climbing >> and it's still
higher than the median household
income. Uh Sitting
at 8.7% in
2022 >> compared to
11 point 3%
for the year over year
change of the median
health
price.
>> Next slide
please
on this side, we are still focusing
on the strategic area
of the homeownership and
wealth. As you can see in this
graph, white households and
Hispanic households lead the
populations in terms
of >> home >> ownership
within this graph.
The graph
outlines
six different categories
in terms of the population dem
demographic and compare
it >> to homeownership within the
state. >> As you
can see the law for
african-american households can be about
point 9% of
homeowners in the
state.
>> The next slide
please.
>> So in homeownership and wealth,
we now look at the women's
market.
Other economic factors have
increased inflation,
necessities or cost of
living which are also
putting the additional strain on major
houses. As you can see,
the median rent industry has
increased in five years >> by
14 >> and >> a half
percent >> in
2018. The median
rent in New Mexico s
at $828.
It ST plans in five
years and >> now >> it's >> at
$966.
>> This is putting
increased strain on
>> wrenches >> that
>> is >> specifically the low to
moderate
wretches.
>> Next slide
please
>> similar to the homeownership
raft. The draft and income
increased by 7.4%
compared to the change in median
rent price of 7.7
percent from the previous
year in this state.
The increase in rent coupled with
that inflation and the increase in
possible living are putting those
putting increased pressure
on renters,
specifically the >> low >> income
>> renters which
this highlights
in more
detail.
Next five
weeks,
>> we now move on to create
more housing, which is the
second strategic >> in >> area.
Here we are looking at the housing
stock in New
Mexico.
Mexico has a higher percentage of
single-family homes than the national
average which makes up
the majority of the students housing
stock. As you can
see the single-family detached
homes up over 65%
of the housing stock followed
second by manufactured
or mobile hou uh mobile
home housing which is
sitting >> at the 0.3
at the time,
>> the lack of housing diversity
and choices can be
problematic in both
urban and rural communities
for almost all income
ranges.
A healthy housing market provides
a diverse housing stock that
allows renters and
homeowners
>> option
X.
>> Like
on this slide, we're looking at the
housing cost burden
in New Mexico. On the
slide, we are comparing the
homeowners to renters
in terms of cost
burden.
Please note that the draft
changed due to a formatting
issue. I currently have a list
up to date version and it will be
made available on our website
and I have >> it,
>> I can have it to you
after this meeting.
>> Um The need is
pressing
>> the housing assessment has
always focused on
cost burden households in New
Mexico. As you can
see in the graph in terms of cost
burden renders are almost
double their homeowner counterparts.
Renters are sitting at
43.9%
in terms of cost burden >> compared
to >> homeowners >> who are sitting
at home to
8.4%
largely due to the lower
income
renters.
>> A decreasing supply of report
will have an option for both funders
and homeowners. Coupled
with that decreasing demand
as a state population grows,
threatens to work worsen our
overburden >> uh
rates cost
over
cost.
>> Next slide,
>> please.
>> Creating more housing has been at the
forefront of everyone's mind.
According to the housing strategy,
by 2025 the state
will need 25,400
units and around
4200. Those
units should be for
30% area union
income and 7600
units should be for the 50%
area median income.
On this graph, we can see that
the building premises in the state of
New Mexico have maintained
an upward trend since
2019, but decreased
by 2.2% in
2023 from
the previous year
in a state
needed uh, need,
need its construction
to have increased since
2019. However,
in recent years,
it was demonstrated by the pre
uh two
presentations ago by uh
Tim and uh
Jeff
that high
construction costs are impacting
the permit issue in the
state of New
Mexico.
Next slide
please.
Next, we move on to preserving
and improving existing
affordable housing and catalyzing
new development in
New Mexico. The majority of homes
were built before 1980
making up 43.2%
of the current state's housing
stock. I
would like to highlight that
15.3% of the
housing stock is compiled
of man uh manufactured
and mobile homes that
was mentioned a few sides ago. It is
important to note that a
state with a large population
of manufactured homes or mobile
homes built prior to
1976
are not compliant with the hud
manufactured home in
construction and safety
standards. As a result
hud only allows for
his of the units rather
than >> rable education of the
unit.
Next,
please,
>> on this side, if you look at
New Mexico housing stock
and looking specifically
at complete plumbing
and kitchen facilities within the
home. As you
said, the majority of homes
in the state were built prior to
1980 which draws attention
to the state of the homes.
On this slide, we are discussing
New Mexico has stock.
Approximately 1%
of the homes do not have complete
plumbing facilities.
In addition, 1% of the
New Mexico homes do not have
complete kitchen
facilities.
I would also like to note that
3.3%
of households currently are
overcrowded in the state and
that will be increasing
as we see
um a
higher housing
stock and
>> increasing
it.
Next slide,
please.
>> Last but not least we are
looking at pretty stable housing
environments for people experiencing
homelessness and people
with special needs. On
the side, you will see the homeless
individuals >> in New
>> Mexico.
I would like to note that
this is a point in time count
and the help of number of people
experiencing homelessness
according to the annual
assessment report increase
by 50% in a oneyear
measure. However, this
is a point in time count.
So >> I would like to highlight that
this is probably
severely
undercount.
>> Also in 2021
the annual assessment report was
not immediately available
as um as >> the report
was built in two parts that
year. So that
is uh the reason
for this. Uh
the
>> next slide,
please.
Last thing we will look
at the homelessness
situation in New
Mexico.
We look at a point in time count
of the different categories of people
experiencing homelessness, including
families with Children,
unaccompanied homeless
youve.
And
again, this is the point in time
counting >> are those
likely severe and
undercount
>> how homeless individuals have
experienced homelessness for
at least one year and have a
severe physical or mental
health condition. The segment of
the homeless population is likely
to live in >> unsheltered
locations.
Next slide.
Eight,
>> this is a five you may be
familiar with as it
contains ma programs.
However, most recently the
housing continuum has been
updated and
the housing continuum contains
all of ma programs
including >> homeless >> transitional
specialized dental
development, single-family
development, homeownership,
homeowners, and as
well as other
programs that >> you help with the
previous.
So
>> on the spot slide, I would like
to highlight the grade 2020
question. I I know I
have presented you with
a
picture of the current
state of the
housing in
Mexico. So in
2023
they had that
$585.2
billion to
18,963
households and
produce finance and
preserved 3707
homes utilizing those
40 to to maintain the
>> affordable
housing.
Next five
days,
>> the
resources
corresponds to
the housing assessment to
this link on this page can
be utilized to find
previous housing assessments
as well as this >> current >> one.
I would like to also highlight
that each figure corresponds
to the Excel
workbook and that is the newest
aspect >> of the house. I
think that would be made available on
the website. >> The >> Excel
>> workbook will contain all
data sources that
would, that would be p
this and it >> will include >> an
interactivity. >> So
you can select >> specific
>> counties >> to view all
information at the county
level as well as
>> Appendix
>> five kids.
And now stand >> for any questions
that you have.
Thank you very much for the
good presentation, all
your work. Um
Do we have any other comments
for you guys like you? >> I do
>> not thank
you. All right, we've got
some questions >> here. >> We have
>> status >> and then we have
representative
I, I'm,
I'm >> determine
>> on the the
no on the
Anno
I, I just call
our,
ok? And then we
have,
right.
Thank you. So we that
over center roach.
Oh, thank you. No,
sure. Thank you.
Oh, I just have a
problem and I do have
one question.
Um three
and I crumping with
this
uh looking at those
percentages of the five
year
growth,
the
door.
Um I have,
we have water
some of our
favorite.
All those things that
this is the presentation
that was
nine years.
I need to mention
this. Water is a
cycle I
don't want and she
doesn't stressing
walk
questions, how much do you
have?
And so if we have
to keep that in mind this
week,
you might have affordable
housing
and then seven
tell you see that
got
so
I said it's just a couple.
I think you really have to
look at those things and
I'd rather be over
percent
have all we need
to, nurses,
no
higher percentage of growth
and have
problems.
Now, on the other
page
H
16.
Yes.
So looking at,
at your
heart
and on
2027
5
a.m.
starts going back
again on the
cost.
Adam Jarret Senator
Gonzalez, the
job in 2021 was
due to a break in
the 2021 high
assessment.
Um I
would I noted when I did the
research at 2021
it was broken into two parts
and the report did severely
change that year. I did
not out of a
neon why I change
only that I did uh
release a
report.
So when the
first part of the report
was a child of
1972
individuals was what was
reported at the
time,
correct? Um The
breaking reporting would most likely
be due to the
COVID-19
pandemic
and that is most likely
for the reason of the two
heart
report.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator very
sedative on Young
on the, I'm gonna do it
again on your very
are
you
thankgiving a little
plus?
Thank you again. Uh
madam chair
MS Gonzalez is uh I'm
gonna mess this up.
No,
II I
would like you. All right.
Um So my question
on slide
15
talked about a little bit and
kind of touched on
overcrowded households,
um, which I know
really impact
rural communities.
But in
urban areas, we,
in fact, my district,
specifically international
district, I see it all the
time. Um, in my
house in complex, like my
immediate next door neighbors
are sleeping
3.5 with
this kid that comes in and out
20 something to a one
bedroom apartment and they're doing
that because that one bedroom
apartment is just
about, it's just under
$1000 a month.
Um, so I
certainly understand the reasons
why, but I was wondering
if you could tell me
exactly how
overcrowding is
to find. And
for the presentation
madam chair
representative
on Monday morning.
Yes. Um,
overcrowding within the
state, we
take the
uh, household and we compare
the amount of people
living within the
household and it is all an
Excel formula.
So, yeah, sure.
Uh,
to address I your representative,
I mean, are you, um, it's
more
compares the number of people in
households to the number of
room like the bathroom. So
I believe that there's more
than 1.5
persons per room
excluding
bathrooms. That's how high
is it finding
overcoming or
overcrowding?
Oh, I know
what, like 3.3%.
I thought that sounds so bad
but, but it's
actually it's
actually gotten pretty out of
hand and I suspect that that
number is, um,
slightly under
calculated, uh, especially
if you're,
I'm kind of thinking out loud at this point. I
apologize madam chair
for ripping like this.
But
if we're going by household,
if that household is
overcrowded, then is
that technically
two like
two overcrowded
households in the one you, does that
make sense? This
kind of that thinking that I'm
doing, um, because they can
be broken into two households
or more to
be un like
not overcrowded.
Ok. Sorry, I'm not on chair
represented all. If you count
the full of people in
the in the
unit or
it could be multiple families.
Our Oh,
great. Thank you. Thank you. That was all I
had. I thank
you. All right, Representative
Kate. Uh Thank you,
chair and thank you for your
presentation. Uh This
is very good. Um
I will go back
to the same size,
different reasons. Slide.
Three. Explain
to me
this because I've seen
this in other
presentations and it
still doesn't make sense to
me if
we have
um over
$800,000
of occupied
housing units and
only 2.1
million people
really at
2.59
individuals per
occupied housing unit
by average.
So what is the
definition of occupied
are these second
homes? We
have a lot of homes with one
people, one
person in them. I, I
don't understand how we can have that
statistic and then the next
15 slides
up.
Uh madam chair
representative case may
um by helping
you uh course to
a person's primary residence.
So it can be a second
home, can be a vacation
rental or it can be a basic
home. So it could be just one
person in a high apartment
or
go
so
and occupy healthy need. It is
also a question of whenever
possible.
I thank you manager. Thank you for
that. Uh the the clarification,
although I still
don't understand how
we can have
almost
half the amount of
housing units for
our population
and still have
the housing crisis
we have. So
someday I hope
someone will explain that to
me um Cause it still
does not make sense to
me. So the other slide
is slide 15.
So you're, I've never
seen this statistic.
We have uh 8000
homes without
completed plumbing
and over
uh almost 8500
homes without a big kitchen
facility is M
fa or do
they uh would
they like the legislature to
carry some kind of bill or
some sort of funding
uh to focus on
this? I mean, here you
have a
minimum of 8000.
I doubt we have
16,000 because
I, I'm guessing that some of
these homes have been out
of the plumbing and kitchen
that's going on,
but we have
8000 units
that would be
plus
that would be eligible
for.
Um Housing
would sounds to
me a little investment.
We're not building it very top.
So what sort of programs
with the N fa can
offer now or would like to
offer in the future to be able
to address
this
mea
um
case. Um
Currently,
ifa I don't
believe we have a specific
sort of targeting this
exact problem, but we do
have rehabilitation
and uh weatherization
um on the
development department
that um target
this. In addition, we have
created a program
that is filling in those gaps
that programs may
not cover specifically.
Um
Currently, the New Mexico has
trust fund now that
the apartments have
been extended. I believe you
better serve. Like I
said, this part
of the housing shop where
we don't need to build from the ground
up, but just
uh spend that for
preserving the home
to ensure that it is
livable. Um
At this time, I'm not aware
of any program M MA
programs specifically
for this, but
um we do have the general
rehabilitation programs as well
as the program
that is fill in those
gaps.
Thank you and thank
you. Thank you
very much for that.
I had just made a very key point
here. So I took note of that
and he said it's so much more
expensive to um
sometimes just remodel
and it's so true. It is,
but there's also a great expense
in demolition if you have to domo
stuff and you feel no
less, but
I, I see what you're saying. Thank you
very much for that.
I TCP.
No, thanks. So thank
you, madam Turner. Just a quick question
and my question is on slide.
19
ok.
II I was
surprised at the
top of create
more housing.
Just 285
new rental
homes
is that unit
285 the state
we only fund the 285
100
got chair uh senator
or uh so
great more housing. Shes
creating those new
uh the
new rental
homes or in this case,
Ns um
I will for 2023
this would uh fall
under the gap financing and what
that correct. Um
The programs are still very
up in terms in terms of New
Mexico has trust fund.
So I expect that we see
more treatments produced
um as one that has
into these, that the
strategic
area.
Well, I mean, the
need is so much greater than
that. Thank
you. Thank
you, Izzie. Did you have one in
common
Hyperama and A or
PC P? Now that is a whole
number for uni created
units? Those are actually
that were completed that year.
Uh We'll mention that under
our rental development
pipeline right now, we have
52 developments
across the state that about
4500
units. And uh I think
it's uh
18 or
27 municipalities in
18 counties that are one
state of construction or another. So
those uh
should start uh finishing
up here within the next year and a
half. I think we should have those
4500 units completed.
Uh Some of those are rehab.
Uh, but, uh, I would say
a good portion of those are
also, uh, new
construction. So there's a good
pipeline on
that just happens to be quite the
as part of new construction.
That's good news. Thank you.
Thank you, Senator. All right,
representative Oke, thank
you. And
this is not in your report,
but I wondered if you guys
can answer this.
Um, so
my mom is up in
this and I go visit
her pretty regularly.
There are three homes that
are um
red T and
um closed.
Does the, does
M fa um
have a program for
demolition of those types of
projects?
And somebody told me yes.
So I, I
ask
madam chair representative,
uh M fa program most
closely aligned with that need
is our restoring our
community program, which
is an a position we have
refill program.
Um This by
V
properties
that
are,
I
would
think more
like
unempolyed
is the store
is a federal program
that's actually a program
inspired by a federal
program. Uh But
it is something we uh
allocated you guys public
trust.
Thank you. I'll have to talk to you about
that. Thank you. Thank you
very much. All right,
I don't have any more
else on the list. I want
to thank you for your good work
and all the great information.
Um I'm going to
on the agenda, we only have one
more item and that's Adger.
So we
go all right.
So this motion
for a
and
thank you. Thank you,
pay your staff, our
staff, the members. You
have a good afternoon. Thank
you
very much.
