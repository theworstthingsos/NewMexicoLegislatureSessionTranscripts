that's what they recommend it
looks like right now Mr speaker
Julie from Bernalillo well it it
not to the first class or posted
on the property in fact the last
clause that you put in on your
amendment would bar me from
forcing that lean would not.
I have a question about the last
full sentence that you put into
your amendment.
it seems to me that this is
creating a an affirmative
Mister speaker July from
Bernalillo it it seems that
their last sentence creates an
affirmative defense for the
owner of the property again some
Mr speaker Representative as
an affirmative defense that is
wholly unrelated to whether the
lean itself is valid.
Mr speaker Representative no it
does not.
And send of the notice to the
wrong person.
Mr speaker Representative the
bill requires you to make a good
faith effort.
Mr speaker gently from
In that case Mr speaker
Representative that would be a
defense for the owner Mr speaker
Mr speaker Representative yes.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
that's how our system of law is
set up.
And now you're carving out in
the notice provision of the
