Madam chair these two elements
lead then to the objective of
house bill twenty.
Which is establishing partition
land grants as bonafide unison
government.
Political subdivisions of the
state.
Similar to a municipality a
county school district of
Conservancy district
And in in doing this madam chair
these partition land grants join
their twenty six centuries old
sister land grants scattered
throughout our fine state.
In that undertaking.
Madam chair this legislation

governor Lujan Grisham has
committed to our legislative
Land Grant leisure and a
partition Land Grant communities
that you will sign house bill
twenty into law.
Madam chair the majority of the
partition land grants are in the
real guiding us watershed.
The heart of the calf canyon
hermit's peak fire.
The underlying reason of these
land grants.
In the coming political
subdivisions.
Is the opportunity to access
state and federal grants for for
screening.
Force restoration.
Watership preservation and
restoration and now Madam.
Fire restoration.
The brakes are to say this.
And at the same time it brings
tears to our eyes.
But the three pocket vetoes by
our two governors denied us the
partition and requests the
opportunity to create fire
mitigation efforts.
In our partition land grants.
Causing the calf canyon Irma's
peak fire to burn with intensity
never seen before to the point.
A bursting boulders in half.
In these partition land grants.
And.
This will not be the case if
these land grants had.
Unit of government status
political subdivisions staffs
manager I'd like to yield to my
experts.
Real outstanding gentleman
leaders in their communities and
their land grants.
And I first of all I would like
to yield to Joseph by the with
the of the blue partition Land
Grant and after that to run
Ortega with the lower than us
partition and those of the
current thank you good morning
chair and committee members my
name is Joseph by the I have
lived in the state he lives for
seventy five years have been a
member of the lost his partition
grant for fifty five years.
I also served on the most he
this partition grant board.
A bit of history in in
chronological order the
community of Los to hear this
was settle around eighteen
hundred the settlers were
farmers ranchers wood cutters
and skilled laborers.
The surrounding area included
small farms and the common
lands.
Farms were adjacent to the gains
river common lands were west of
the village in the mountains and
the forest the partition grant
is the common lands west of the
village the forested area around
mostly he this was used as
common lands.
For the community of Las for
Hillis it was organized with the
governing structure some of the
uses of the COVID lands include
grazing timber.
Would hunting try farming and
some irrigation.
Move forward to nineteen fifty
one.
The Las Vegas land grant wanted
to sell the common lands west of
those fifteen.
A group of individuals from
mostly here in this when to the
district judge who was in charge
of the Las Vegas Land Grant and
procured D. common lands we have
a deed for the land.
This deed was for three thousand
acres and became the partition
Land Grant of loss for Hulu's
Las Vegas land grant gave a deep
for the common lands to the
community of Las Vegas this
occurred around nineteen fifty
one similar deeds were given to
lower going this and others
would pay taxes on that land and
we are assessed on that land.
The petition grant of nineteen.
Fifty one is been governed by an
elected board of trustees the
partition grant has been a self
governed and has defended itself
in court.
We have been a standalone entity
we have regular meetings that
are held in compliance with the
open meetings act.
There is a set of by laws we
have regular elections.
Michelle Lee.
We were asked.
Initially we asked to become a
unit of government because of
the challenges lost he this was
experiencing in receiving.
Watershed restoration and fire
prevention funding from the
state we just finished thirty
four hundred acres we were
stopped said you're not a unit
of government.
We went to the.
Legislative Intrum.
Council.
They said the only the
legislature could do that.
The state forestry has approved
funds to reduce the risk of fire
to the watershed of of Las Vegas
but the uncertain status of
mostly he this us not being a
unit of government the late
moving the funds.
Additionally those for healers
successfully defended itself in
court against another state.
Landowner would block access on
a road to the thinning project
most healers prevailed in
District Court and appellate
courts and it was a great
sacrifice to the members we
receive no support or help from
the Las Vegas loan Land Grant.
Now permit speak I.
Thermos before your.
Byrd  eighty percent of our
mountain eighty percent of
We need help to recover the
burned trees for wood and timber
we need help to restore Graham a
grant to the range and replant
trees the loss of trees and
grass has resulted in asked to
bring the mud in the rotation
this is affected the water
supply last week is.
That water supply is.
Those of you the reform know
that the city has a.
I guess a portable filtration
plant that story lake the bread
during the Petersen reservoir
cantik Water the river flow
there it was great this body was
it was awful.
This is affected the water
supply of Las Vegas we really
need help to become a unit of
government to address this
catastrophe.
Additionally.
He lives has approximately seven
members plus significant others.
We can come to.
Roughly about two hundred votes
in district forty that support
become a unit of government.
Summary we support house bill
twenty to become a unit of
government thank you for your
time and attention.
Thank you.
Also on.
now madam chair I'd like to
yield to run Ortega with the
lower than us partition wrecked.
Thank you Representative good
morning ladies and gentleman
chilly morning glad to see
everybody here both of these
gentlemen have given history of
what's been going on with the
land grant I'm not going to go
down that road.
When I found out house bill
twenty was going to be a reality
I had to stop and think what
just happened the last eight
years.
Eighty years we've been working
on this thing.
Been here talk to you.
What's going on here.
For some reason this land grant
issue has become political
capital.
It's close the agents that take
place.
My experience I've never sat
where you sat but I have sat as
a county commissioner for San
Miguel County district one for
land grants located.
I have had the insight to
understand how deals are cut.
What happens.
Ours is not a big issue is going
to affect a lot of people in New
Mexico but it affects us.
It affects us terribly.
Representative distributed
history how in the world can
this issue come before the
legislature and get pocket
vetoed by one political power.
Opens his mouth.
Shoots is down.
Why why does this happen.
When in front of you.
You have a copy of the
resolution.
You have this resolution that
clearly identifies what the Los
Vegas board DS.
To recognize the control and the
ability that we had already
shown.
Our ability to govern ourselves.
This resolution.
That was signed by the head
judge fourth judicial District
Court judge Harris and.
And the Las Vegas board clearly
identifies that with our land
grant we have shown since the
nineteen fifties when as was
stated land was taken from us
two thousand acres.
Two thousand acres at the drop
of a hat was removed from us.
So we have proven the fact that
we can govern that we can
manage.
We just don't have the political
clout for some reason.
For some reason we have lacked
political clout to make this
thing happen.
Today you will have the
opportunity.
To visit with the next
generation of leaders of the
land grants.
Mr Patty and I on the category
of on Seattle's.
For the elders and it wasn't but
just a few days ago I was ten
years old.
And I started to attend.
Land Grant maintenance with
figurehead Ortega.
Well look at what that stands
out.
My grandfather.
Ruben Ortega.
Then I came of age I served as
secretary I've served as
president I've been a member.
And today I'm happy to say.
You'll be talking to the two the
representative in the land
grants to date where the elders.
One of the advisors.
But we're also.
I have experience white hair.
I'm going to stop and I'm just
simply going to pose a simple
question specially to
Representative sciences and to
specially Representative
Castellano.
It's time to do the right thing.
It's time to write things.
Not the political thing.
This issue that we're dealing
with what we need.
To correct.
I want.
How much the calf canyon far
April six twenty twenty two.
What's wrong.
They knew it.
They didn't do the right thing.
They lit a match.
What they should not have let a
minute match.
Between the two of us we control
six thousand acres plus.
And a target.
Rocks blew up.
It has been sanitized.
Yes USDA NRCS came brown said
let's see that.
Good does it do seated.
Our top so the most valuable
part of the land the top six to
eight inches of topsoil has been
sanitized.
The end myself as I said with
the on channels with the elders.
We've done our part.
I respectfully request.
We vast we've told we're to
point out to demand.
The right thing has to be done.
Do.
What we've been working so hard
for this resolution states.
Do not handicap that group of
people who are eager and willing
to take on the task because it's
going to take forty to fifty
years plus to recover.
And believe you me.
I'm never gonna see sixty six
again.
I'm past that.
Please do the right thing we
need house bill twenty.
To move forward politically.
You fail for you make a lot of
people happy.
Constituents that want you not
to pass house bill twenty.
You can keep them happy.
Those of us that you want the
governor has given you a way
out.
Hundred million.
dollars make us happy you're in
a win win situation anyway but
it is not the right thing to do.
The right thing to do first let
us.
All the resolution.
You will not be disappointed.
These young men will take this
piece of legislation to a level
that will make you all proud.
Thank you.
Thank you Mr for the

People.
You can come up to the to the
Mike here.
The office.
Madam chair members of the
commission.
My name is Steve Polanco.
I am the president of the
Terabithia Land Grant.
To remedy a land grant became
well known during the well
digger during the courthouse
right.
The reason why the courthouse
right happened was because the
people were not listened to they
were not recognized by anybody.
To be a land grant.
Since then we've made.
Tremendous strides we started to
work as youth I was twenty eight
I'm seventy one now.
I've been with the land grant
and the essay because most of my
life but I became active when I
was twenty eight.
People would not listen to what
we were taught about.
We had no recognition we have no
funding we had nothing
everything was volunteer our
ancestors they worked the land
they were on sandals which I'm
about to be.
I learned a lot from them we
learned a lot about our ancestry
we learned about our history our
history of who we are we did not
come here we were here we did
not wouldn't forced to leave
across the river they came
across to us we were here with
the Indians with the native
American people we are part of
the native American people.
We all share this.
We became the land grant after
the the bad news of what
happened at the courthouse.
We organized we were educated we
became.
Part of the community and
Representative the committee we
still do Representative that
community that community
benefits from what the work that
we have done we are under
chapter forty nine which is
recognized.
Thank you I support hope you
support.
Chapter this this bill it's very
important to be recognized after
so many years hundreds of years
of not being recognized we
deserve to be recognized thank
you.
Next I have.
Thank you read this Harry so
sorry maybe it's not.
This local level that's very
different.
Very Mr of Lara Europe.
First everybody today madam
chair members of the council I
stand in favor of the Senate
vote house bill twenty the
that's going to affect the
secretary of the six.
Of land grants that have been
explained to you by
Representative me the luxury
store that.
let me take a different view of
here and and and and thank you
in a in a different route
one of the things that has been
lacking in our community for
centuries now as Steve said
we've been here for quite some
time.
Our our land grant was
established in nineteen thirty
two.
I know services by president the
board of trustees but anyway one
of the things that has been
lacking in our community.
For some reason or another has
been access to wealth and that's
what happened to these folks in
the state six of subdivisions of
of of of of that we want to make
subdivisions of state government
and by that I mean to say that
we haven't had the resources
although we've been good all
okay good good carers we have
taken good care of our lands and
and we have appreciated the
culture and the history that we
produce.
So I stand in favor of of this
so of house bill number twenty
and I would appreciate your your
help on this thing.
Thank you for that sorry about
that name fumbling.
Of the under the.
From.
Madam chair committee members I
am on the help of the young and
I'm president of the tunnel to
my land grant.
A land grant that has quite a
bit history we were established
in seventeen thirty nine and we
have been continuously in the
area since then and we hope to
be there for a long time in the
future I am and one hundred
percent support of this bill
because these communities have
been working hard and they have
been acting as political
subdivisions of the state of New
Mexico doing everything that's
required elections
submitting budgets if they need
to I mean it's showing
everything that we're doing the
only thing that they haven't had
is.
Revenue stream.
If you approve this bill that
gives them the revenue stream
which will do.
Countless wonderful things not
just for the errors but for the
communities as a whole.
It will allow them to create
jobs for their youth.
For the elderly anybody needs
jobs it could allows them to
create services coming in to
land right now we work with
devoted to county fire
department this last Saturday.
They went in and cut on a bunch
of dead and done with in the
basket and our land grant one in
there and removed it we removed
over five cords of wood in a
matter of two hours.
That's going to clean up the
busca we won't have those
horrible fires that we had a
Valencia County because of that.
What is going to be given to
those who are in need are they
have to do is call a land grant
thing coming get courts will get
what they need to keep
themselves warm.
As we move forward we're going
to try to find more jobs get
more use involved in getting
that one out of there splitting
up and providing it for the
people of the community and not
just errors anybody in the
community will benefit so if you
help these land grants they will
be able to help everyone not
just errors but the whole
community and I think our job as
as members of New Mexico
citizens in New Mexico and US
legislators need to support the
people of the state and that's
what you'll be doing thank you.
Thank you next up I'm not sure
if this company is is Camilla
Camilla from the State Land
Office.
Maybe next time members of the
audience at print your names
because I'm I'm becoming an
elder myself.
Good morning madam chair
committee members killer within
Mexico State Land Office the
Land Office also stand in
support of this bill thank you.
Thank you Mr.
Mr or data entry or data your
next.
Good morning members of the
committee my name etcetera tega
standing here as a secretary for
the lower than this Landon board
Think lots been said in our
needs.
What happened to us could have
been prevented and speaking of
the fires.
We need this bill to pass apply
for grant money to for on
specific specifically for the
lower gayness Land Grant and
list the list and grant we stand
in the watershed.
Had we been allowed to properly
manage our own lands a lot of
this devastation we're facing
right now could have been
avoided.
State forestry other elected
officials have told us for years
this is how you do it.
We listened and we paid the
price for it.
Now it's time for you to listen
to us and give us what we need.
So I have to say vote for us.
Thank you Mr king Donna Mr
Vasquez benefits you.
Thank you.
Good morning madam chair no
members of this committee Paul
money's money for us to welcome
the president of the center
around that number here to let
you know that the are grants
supports this bill and we favor
really requested tell you also
support this bill house bill
twenty.
We would like to supported from
the fact that this would be is
basically one of the issues is
there's unity numbers and there
is strength in numbers the more
land grants we can get together
and work to tell there's a
common goal means strength and
influence in our communities
also this bill will provide this
land grants this upload a long
land grants resources the action
is critical for them to
accomplish those objectives that
they have in their local
communities and as the land
grant in the Bignon square area
these resources are extremely
critical of just in the basic
issue of getting money to buy a
paper to to your office work
releases real money to be able
to get a small contractor do
some work in cutting wood or
clean up the area so I can
submit to that of I think
support of this bill is
beneficial not only to this land
grants but also to the state of
New Mexico.
Thank you thank you Mr Vasquez
at now we have one Sanchez.
Good morning madam chair members
of the committee my name is Juan
Sanchez I am chairman of the New
Mexico land grant council the
council is a state agency that
has five council members
appointed by the governor the
council stand in support of this
bill twenty and cultural we will
provide the technical assistance
needed to these land grants to
make sure that they do what
needs to be done as a unit a
complement thank you very much.
Sanchez looking Romero.
Is working Romero still here.
Okay we'll go to our to our to
that.
Thank you madam chair again up
my name is our trucks that time
with the New Mexico land grant
council I just wanted to to
point out for the committee that
there's these three communities
that were or the two communities
over here today as well as the
other communities that are
mentioned in the bill they're
all landowners just like any
other land grant they own their
common lands fee simple they
manage those resources on behalf
of their community and
recognizing them as political
subdivisions will give them the
same opportunity to other land
grants have to better manage
their their properties as well
as to provided additional
services if they're in what's
the complexities of the be
entitled to additional resources
that'll help them expand beyond
just services related to the
management of the natural
resources I know there's been
some concerns raised about
issues regarding the treaty on
that this would have it and and
an adverse impact on land grants
under the treaty when we all go
there's been a lot of analysis
that's been done by the
committees of prior years that
really is an issue this is
really about the authority of
the state of New Mexico being
able to recognize introduce
units a government which is
authority that that the state
has and that she was a
legislative body have.
And so miss madam chair that's
all I have for my presentation I
do think madam chair that you
did miss one individual Mr
anything Donna I think you got
him in Mr Ortega at the same
time and so I think the
introduce the president up one
of the grant was one just
because well.
Many apologies thank you Zurcher
that the.
Good morning madam chair members
of the committee my name is that

president of the loss of his
land grant and I'm here today to
see in support of house bill
twenty
seeking here petitioning the
committee here to be in support
of the house bill twenty as
well.
one of the things that hasn't
been talked about is briefly the
fire that took place.
Devastated our entire land and
one of the things that we don't
talk about much is who's going
to clean up that mess.
I'll tell you is going to clean
up that mess is going to be
dedicated members of this land
grants who have a love and
compassion for this land that
actually roll up their sleeves
and get to work and claim that
timber up.
Who else is going to do it if
not us and so I just wanted to
convey that to to the to the

grandfather.
Excuse me my grandfather prince

nothing to do about politics it

violating a law has been
established but not only
internationally but also has
been established through the
state constitution New Mexico
through numerous cases
throughout the country and
Supreme Court there's a trending
bar decision there is the Los
Alamos court decision Supreme
Court decision we could just go
on and on and on this is a cool
baseball ation of the people's
rights of these communities I

May I speak in Spanish.
Of course okay.
You know so it The New Mexico
land grant.
St Louis Siegel this the will
they told us A. intentos date
Correa is this a project of the
day but I could add levels land
grants.
By profession I am a loaded in
my County that is Columbia I
understand of a low.
one thing that I a.
Notice that these land grants
like motor Landon does betas
longer and I and I fighting for
all these years is that the
state legislator don't have
authority to create new land
grants.
Is only a federal level.
But but this is land grants will
be a new land grants.
So you don't have authority.
We live in a rural area we are
so for you the state in with
that.
but we also know that FEMA USDA
programs a.
But I'm up from where they le
of I see that they they meet the
guys in a nursing Santa goes.
Hey miss fired is not is
controlling prescribed a five
year but also we so for but
burning so we propose these low
because we think that you don't
have the authority to to create
a new land grants he is not only
the ace ace base B. twenty is
that ace B. thirty three that
you're going to present David

Because the.
The best of the lady consists
public I don't know maybe sooner

don't know thank you thank you
ma'am misconduct.
Next is Mr are gone I think is a
Joel Emilio I I can't see the.
Thank you miss out on.
My name is you are on.
I'm a trustee with the lesser of
the and we oppose this.
Bill Page three twenty.
This is a.
The email that I sent to.
They have all of our secretary
of the interior because.
The very word partition.
Says it all can you take a hand.
Eight.
Pocket vetoes.
Somebody's trying to tell you
something.
Thank New Mexico legislative
action toward.
International treaty the treaty
of Guadalupe that it will.
Has no standing.
This bill affects thousands of
native American in his final
people for the benefit of a few
developers attempting through
state.
Legislation to affect an
international treaty for which
they have no authority to modify
it in any way.
This should it not at nine
o'clock which.
Another effort to try to break
up.
That land grants imagine very
soon that because of the people
that of that are hurting from
the.
I'm sorry your dad listening
anymore.
Representative this this this is
a very strange that they take it
on the backs of people I lost my
home.
Other people lost even more.
And and it's a very seeing that
these people would take
advantage of this now to try to
use the loss of land.
And the the fire scarring that
just happened to try to pass
this bill again.
Eight bills take a in you've
been pocket vetoed eight times.
It's about time to drop it.
Ernesto Lujan.
Do I need to get to the speaker
can you hear me that would be
helpful to use the microphone Mr
Lujan thank you SO that the
webcast can hear you.
I would like to state setting
Madam chairman and committee.
My name is that is the real fun
and I don't want to go back to
history or whatever I don't want
to you about or anything like
that but every Land Grant does
have problems.
The problem that we have with
our land grant he's not really a
problem they're maintaining
their managing them with letting
them do that these words
partition.
Committee to take out.
We have a lot Mentzer and then
allotments are questions they're
a portion of land that there
were deeded to the communities
of the people so that they could
maintain what they have in their
communities it's common that the
same thing as calm is good at
the water is common case so in
reality you don't want for ten
years like miss or thank us here
said that date nothing happened
nothing happened because it was
not
an individual to take care or
take the bull by the horns I did
it for ten years I pay taxes in
some of the land grants or some
of the partitions that they call
by the allotments I make sure
that there will be by myself I
think we'll pass anybody I paid
in because I wanted for that
these but particularly land
grants to maintain and keep it
is traditional and its culture.
So if they're trying to do
something else to step to say in
a lot then.
No and allotment.
We have the reason that I'm
speaking here is because we do
have a but lost in that that
that land grant all the all the
other land grants don't have
anything needs management the
the do something that they're
not supposed to do it we're
going to do it and we the board
get appointed by the district
judge but this fourth district
judge Mr Lujan thank you.
Next we have of Ralph Lombok.
I apologize if I'm pronouncing
that incorrectly.
Morning.
When it was rough lumber on vice
chair of more land grant and I'm
also a spokesman for these.
Senator crystalline grand
coalition.
there's a million arguments can
go on in this right now bottom
line is these two bills violate
my constitutional rights violate
my rights under the constitution
of the state of New Mexico.
Both of these bills violate the
state the federal government I
mean the United States
constitution write this down
article six section two the
United States constitution is
called the Supreme Soviet
the Supreme Missy Act was set up
by our forefathers for this very
reason to keep small groups
within our bar numbers from
destroying us from within these
bills violate this Supreme
Soviet and I'll tell you
something else we have a we had
a.
Bill all house bill six I
believe it was his become our
new civil rights bill I
guarantee you that if you push
try to push use house bill
twenty and house bill thirty
three which are little brothers
back to back there's hardly any
difference at all they both
violate all of our land grants
not just our land grants violate
the treaty of other groupies
uncle going to violate the
public lands is will you people
don't know how deep you're
getting into this when you start
messing with the Land Grant
walls.
We will take you to the Supreme
Court we will take and sue each
of you individually under their
new all Civil Rights Act house
bill two four to consider
seriously this bill is in
violation of federal Sen
violation of our civil rights is
in violation of our state
constitution you can't pass
these bills are garbage they
have been garbage for the last
eight years we have not stood up
until now and now we do.
Thank you we have Mr Ronald ocal
next.
The past.
Okay now we're gonna go to to
the zoom and I'd like for the
folks who run the soon to raise
your hand if on the zoom if you
or if you'd like to testify in
support of the of the bill will
do support first and then
opposition so those on the zoom
who want to participate raise
your hand and support.
I'm saying man if you'd like to
make a comment in opposition
please raise your hand.
I'm saying none of it.
The COVID is is now closed I'd
like to go back to the bill
sponsor very quickly that we're
going to take questions.
Madam chair of.
We've done our presentation and
We stand for questions.
Thank you representative Garcia
do I have any questions from the
committee.
Yes Representative.
Madam chair of Representative
and gentleman
thank you for coming here I I
have one I'm I'm very brand new
I'm I'm a freshman legislator
first I'm I'm actually from the
NMAA so and born and raised
there so but I'm but I'm I'm
very new to this of the to to
all of this stuff so if I I just
have one quick question if you
guys could clarify for me what
exactly can you define what a
political subdivision of the
state is can you kind of explain
to those of us that are quite
privy to that.
Thank you Madam chair
representative Maria.
In our state statutes we have
defined what a political
subdivisions.
And it's basically a unit of
government
The.
Part of the state structure.
And.
A unit of government or
political subdivision
for example is a city.
The municipality.
A political subdivisions is a
county government.
A political subdivision is a
school board.
A political subdivisions is a
Conservancy district.
A a political subdivision is a
a specific improvement district
like for example
a royal control flood control.
and.
also madam chair members the
Maria are just seconds are also
identified as political
subdivisions.
And as of two thousand and four.
The majority of land grants
under chapter forty nine
article one.
Which were about twenty two land
grants automatically became
political subdivisions.
And
Chair I pause because there was
a disparaging comment made in
the back after my statement.
And madam chair
in two thousand and four
The state legislature.
Created
Political subdivisions that as
for proximity twenty two thank
grants under article one.
There were.
Other land grants that we're not
in this large pool of article
one nine requests.
Initially these land grants went
back to sixteen ninety two like
my Land Grant and that the
school.
In all about to about eighteen
thirty something
under the Mexican government but
there were some land grants.
That we call article to land
grants.
Your comment Land Grant.
Is an article to.
The fiscal land grant is an
article to help.
These land grants did not become
political subdivisions in two
thousand and four so madam
chair.
So then came to this body and
just.
That we grant them political
subdivisions status of what
we're trying to do with the six
partition requests.
Also madam chair Representative
and Representative and Leah.
In the land grants statute
chapter forty nine there was
about.
Six land grants that were what
we term statutorily specific.
That did not become.
Posted in for so.
Chile land grants in these
mountain.
The court not the land grant.
The months on a land grant on
these mountain.
and I'm probably leaving out a
couple more they had to come to
the legislature.
And do the same thing that we're
doing with the partition land
grants.
Representative us that we grant
them political subdivisions
status.
So.
The the the units of government
the political subdivisions the.
Are basically kind of.
The arms and the legs of state
government.
We're connected to the head.
You know and
so I hope that kind of
explained.
You know
to some degree your question
about what a political
subdivisions yes madam chair and
Representative it it it does and
thank you for that I I
appreciate that it brought up
just one hopefully hopefully
simple you mention in two
thousand four many of them
became political and grants or
political subdivisions and some
of them didn't what was can
anyone does anyone know why some
and not the other.
And chair and representative
Lente is because.
The way that that they're in
identified in chapter forty
nine.
they the article to land grants
so then.
At the school and some other
ones did not automatically
become political subdivisions
because the legislation only
captured those article one land
grants those twenty two land
grants.
And
that's why in these other land
grants that I mentioned.
Statutorily specific.
They're identified in chapter
forty nine.
Specifically she levy months on
all the quote that they did not
become automatically political
subdivisions Madam that's why
they have to come back to the
legislature and have us granting
that status.
Excellent madam chair
Representative thank you very
much.
Thank you Representative million
are there any other questions
yes Representative huh yes madam
chair the representative of.
R. I come from the south eastern
part of New Mexico which we
don't have land grants seven all
of ours is is either State Land
or product so when we help
someone with great.
Requests if if this is granted
does that mean that you are no
longer a land grant the two now
has private land just like the
rest of the.
Madam chair Bob in the
political.
Subdivisions madam chair
and group Representative main
size and.
The partition and requests are.
Vibrant.
Land Grant communities.
and the pin so for generations I
understand and and madam chair
Is there their status.
And their traditions and their
customs and their values.
As a political subdivisions.
A as a land grant.
Is not going to change because
of us.
granting them madam chair this
political subdivisions that is
in fact.
Those customs those traditions
those rights.
Are going to be enhanced.
Because we have protections.
In chapter forty nine if you are
a political subdivisions.
A if we do have a political
subdivisions that is and what
are some of those.
Rights or some of those
opportunities chair one.
If we have political
subdivisions.
You can have an adverse
possession lawsuit filed against
you.
And that's where people that's
one of the the the biggest.
Expenses of land grants up to
two thousand and four.
Was that we had people many
times coming from out of state.
Coming onto our land grants.
Basically staking a claim.
Two part of a common land madam
chair.
Going to the county assessor.
And.
Recording the.
A quit claim deed.
Started paying taxes on.
And claiming that that was
there's that can no longer
happen under a political
subdivisions that are so angry
also chair the opportunities
that come with being a political
subdivisions is that these
requests now for the first time
and the opportunity to pull down
capital outlay money.
Just like the city's just like
the counties just like the
school boards just like the
Conservancy districts just like
the the special districts
dealing with the Roybal flood
control etcetera now they can
utilize come to us apply for
capital outlay to kind of carry
out the needs and functions of
improving infrastructure
improving social initiatives
empowering their community in
that process.
Of Representative you understand
the somewhat of the land grant
and I you know.
I I agree that no one should be
able to even touch any of these
land grants for whatever reason
I mean if they've been done it
then we should address that for
sure because these were all
given to your ancestors.
Before.
Any of us were ever even thought
of but
It I guess it's just.
I said the strange today is so
we're you're asking us to give
you status where we can give you
money.
Under the political whatever.
And the.
But the.
Is that the.
So you all will have to file
just like the cities and states
all these all this paperwork
prove you have to submit things
but is there any.
What only know what had a put it
you know at the usually if you
give something you get something
what does the state get for
granting this is there any
upside to what advantage the
state has.
All over.
We give up something to you.
The the in turn give.
Something to the state.
Miss madam chair
Percent in Mason there is no
quid pro quo here no no no no I
didn't mean it that way but I
understand exactly what you're
saying we have more control over
the city's I understand the
counties saying and we don't
have any control over you all
are shouldn't have I mean the
way I think donor dollars
sovereign lands nearly Madam
chair representative Mason and
so the the the the the the get
that.
Is that we're that these land
grants are running their Land
Grant.
There in the government
naturally with an elected board
of trustees.
To the fullest professional
level available in terms of
their elections.
You know the the issue of
dealing with the open meetings
act.
And because of political
subdivisions.
Their fall under the audit act.
To where they have to report
meticulously.
If they qualify for capital
outlay of that hello that
capital outlay was applied.
In terms of following
procurement.
And then the process the most
important in regards to the
issue of what the state gets
back.
It gets and then lightened.
Community.
That's been decorated.
In in twenty four seven focused.
On consolidating.
Their traditional.
Inheritance.
With fear of ever it being lost
because that's what we these
land grants get him being part
of the political subdivisions.
There is no way that these
outsiders.
Or.
People engaged on on seizing
that common that can never do
that because we have those
protections in statute
currently.
Course of and I appreciate that
and that pretty much it I mean I
don't want to see any land
grants.
I don't think I mean but I
thought you already had that
protection that we couldn't may
not.
The red in about money I thought
Joe were protected by your land
grants as long as they've been
the only other one one more
question if I may madam chair
what of this group of land
grants that that this will
affect.
I take it but listen in that not
all of covered by this really
wanted what percentage of the
land grants it'll be covered
under this statute what this
protection and how many don't
want to protect.
Is there a percentage of it have
any land grants this affect that
but if there's T. and I wanted I
don't want others I wanted to
don't want it
Madam chair representative Mazen
that's a good question.
We were granting madam chair the
political subdivisions status to
these partition requests how
many is there six of them that's
a.
And the if some of these
partition land grants do not
wish.
To partake.
In that opportunity of becoming
a political subdivisions they
don't have to.
The madam chair those that do
have to follow a process that
we've outlined in house bill
twenty.
Which is registering.
There.
There
The the registering.
Their documentation.
With the Attorney General.
In terms of.
The coming a political
subdivisions that they have to
go through that process.
And also madam chair
just kind of the land grant
council also aids in the in
determining also whether this is
a viable community land grant
that has has a historical past
and has pursued you know
implementing those rules and
regulations that have come with
managing their comments up to
this point so yes.
That these parts six partition
land grants have the opportunity
not to become a political
subdivisions if they would not
wish to follow the process that
we've outlined in under
understood that part but I
didn't get a Representative
really of their six six great
land grants covered under this
how many have.
They want to participate and
have any of said that don't want
to participate.
Senator I know that the those we
he less.
we have the the lord gayness we
have the our oil on the lottery
what.
And to some degree of car then.
and
is the other two Senate we stand
side on the wall and that really
they've been they've part
they've been participating in
the discussion and debate but
they haven't really stepped up
to the same degree that these
that these community let and
these partition and requests
have madam chair.
In the and madam chair I think
of a dose of the of the wishes
to kind of reflect on one of the
questions are representative may
some folks if I could yield to.
Representative Mason please do.
What are we giving back to well
of a new yes added makes out a
lot of terror they don't no no
no they are not monetary
The drinking water for the city
of Las Vegas he purchased a one
point six million a portable
filtration system community
allow walking into the McKenna
Canada where a.
All of those are tributaries
into the game this river it's
flowing with mod in action that
we're trying to replenish the
grasslands one examples of
belong project we leveled ten or
fifteen acres would clean the
trees we planted gramma grass
clover.
Work beautifully.
Another project is a one up near
Senator Collett out we just
finished a ten fifteen acre
project there we cleared the
wood with a bulldozer by the way
that the expense one of our
members brought bulldozer and
it's all pro bono we cleared
that we're in the process
getting the wood to the people

so we are trying to do our best
to mitigate the Roshen and all
the stuff coming down the river
plus we're selfish you know we
want to re have been restore
land but we're trying to give
back all weekend Sir well that
that and and you know it the you
know read also the you know they
went through this with the the
drinking water for for a I will
guard and stuff for the what's
boldly like the native you know
several years ago that this far
completely fill that like.
You know course it wasn't on any
kind of.
Land Grant land so let me that
was.
They have finally pretty much
got this took several years for
for them to get that cleared up
the and I'm not even sure if
it's all cleared up yet all
these things I understand thank.
To destroy it in two days and it
takes years to restore the plan
thank you for your comments it
helps up.
Thank you Representative I
understand that there are some
folks who like to be to make
public comment public comment is
closed I'm sorry I cannot open
it up again but if you could
just raise your hand if there if
you're in support.

opposition.
Okay thank you.
I apologize Representative yes
ma'am vice chair passing thank
you madam chair.
Representative Garcia members of
the.
Presenting.
Since it's a new board I think
everybody here is fairly new on
this border new on this board.
Can you guys described the
definition of or describe how
what the implementation to
District Court has in the last
eight Las Vegas land grants so
we can understand what important
role the district judge place
with this specific land grants.
madam chair.
And the reason Castellano
The District Court does not play
any role.
Regards to these partition land
grants.
that are that
the there were a partition from
the less than us Land Grant.
The Las Vegas Land Grant does
function.
on the very of different.
Structure.
Then.
The overwhelming majority of the
land grants.
In that the overwhelming
majority of the land grants.
In fact all the land grants.
Existing.
Functioning.
Madam chair that have elected
board of trustees.
That are kind of
Of the governance two four.
The maintenance.
The the empowerment of the
grant.
Are basically ruled by an
elected body of the errors.
The Las Vegas land grants.
Is basically governed by the
District Court.
The district judge Dr then.
Determines who the three.
Board members are going to be.
So the the the Mr chair of the
board the board for the last
thing this land grant is not
elected by the heirs of the Las
Vegas Land Grant a district
judge makes the determination of
who.
The board.
Members will be and if if if Mr
by the Mr loan if.
Or did not wish to kind of add
to that thank you again for the
clarity I would yield to them if
it's I'm sure let me ask okay so
from what I'm hearing
Representative Garcia is that.
The district judge.
Nominates three more members to.
To the board of the Las Vegas
language correct and Madam chair
representative customer that's
correct so that's the only real
the District Court for district
judge plays in this.
Land grants that's correct and
Madam the.
Thank you.
Is there any other questions
from the committee members to
make a motion madam chair.
Let me make a motion madam chair
to a table and I'd like to
explain level.
Second.
There is a table in motion can
will you call the roll.
all up to me to do it by roll
call okay
Representative Mason.
Is this for the table motions
yes.
Representative Mirabel Millia.
Yes.
Representative.
Yes I'd like to see my vote.
Good.
Representative.
Yes like to explain level
please.
Representative vice chair
because they on yes.
And.
Sure yes no to table.
I believe we should go to
Representative Sweetser first to
explain.
Thank you madam chair a I just
want to tell this group fund
this is a tough circumstance
are.
As you guys know in our to the
nose I've carried legislation
for this group in the past
I felt that our friends from
much of the money I get land
Two years ago when I was vice
chair of appropriations.
There was a bill to get funding
for the land grants reoccurring
that was supposed to die in
appropriations and I asked the
chair please let this pass it
was supposed to die so are you
guys all right not but in this
case we have two groups that are
both land grants it's like
picking a.
We're gonna speaking between
family and in this case are the
majority of my district that
spoken to me over the last five
years as opposed to this and
that's why opposing this bill so
I just want to make clear
I'm always going to be with the
land grants but this is a
special circumstance where we
got our brothers and sisters
fighting I just wanted to expand
my thank you.
Representative says.
Sure
I'd like to Representative and
and the group I'm opposing this
bill only because although I I
really really want to see owes a
new political subdivisions born
and be a part of something new
of growth of something.
Everything that we did I did we
did a tremendous amount of
research found that that this is
has constitutional problems.
And for that reason I mean with
the we looked up here to see
were Congress it is the one
that's supposed to grant them
and and that we don't have the
power and I think there's some
issues there that I looked with
through our through attorneys
madam chair and I really take
this very serious I want to you
all that this is very hard for
us very hard for me because I
can which allowed him to one
word one we have we have to a
here when we we we put our our
hands up to
Protect the constitution an
honor the constitution I think
that very serious and I think we
all do in in in in in different
aspects with the matter what
what constitutional
respect you have for with the
use of second amendment rights
and freedoms of speech at and
and in this case this is the
problem there's constitutional
issues I think I don't see this
is a political thing madam chair
I think that this because we did
a lot of research madam chair
and I think this is why it's
been vetoed and so forth I think
that was it thank you madam
chair representative had access
at age between has been tabled.
Garcia
this is the only bill that is on
the agenda today at eighteen
thirty three forty five will be
heard at a later date so this
