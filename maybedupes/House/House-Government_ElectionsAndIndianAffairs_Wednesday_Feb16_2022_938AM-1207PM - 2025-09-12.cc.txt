It.
I'll see if I can get him back
but the of.
I was going to ask questions
about what you thought our
schedule was going to be I guess
that's all moot said she made an
amendment to your first
announced so.
Okay.
Trying to get him back my
apologies let's let's take about
three minutes to regroup and get
our committee members at the
table and then we'll do roll
call.
Thank you.
What.
I don't know if anyone can hear
me but I can't hear anything.
Good morning ladies.
We're taking a few minutes to
regroup at.
Amanda.
Yes how does it look regarding
our committee members we have a
quorum okay let's go ahead and
take role thank you.

Representative Rehm.
Here ma'am.
Representative Zamora here.
Madam chair Johnson.
Here.
Madam chair blue.
Madam chair blue is excuse and
that I believe Representative
Gallegos is on the way so we
have a quorum.
Good morning and thank you
everyone sorry about the
confusion.
We will go ahead and start with
that Senate bill one ninety
eight as amended.
Who do we have presenting that
bill we have.
I believe Representative guy a
goes is presenting that bill.
Senator Neville.
Can you hear me.
There can you hear me now.
Yes we can hear you.
Representative at we're gonna
start with Senate bill one nine
eight and Representative
Gallegos is on on the way.
Your is that who you have
presenting this bill.
I can presenter she can present
we I briefed her on the bill
okay to.
Okay Representative guy goes and
Senator we're ready to hear
Senate bill one ninety.
Very good madam chair
Senate bill ninety one ninety
eight is the final step I guess
in the the cleaning up.
All of the rules regulations
that relate to the PRC after we
passed the constitutional
amendment about two or three
years ago we converted DRC to
essentially a regulatory agency
dealing with so with utilities
and utilities already we have
they have a.
The mobile mobile section aria
transportation section but the
caller.
Odile section over and DO need.
And this bill even though it's a
lengthy bill it is very simple
in concept it's pretty well
summarized on the last pages
page one fifty seven under
section eighteen which
essentially says that the.
All staff positions functions
personal appropriations money
records equipment supplies
property and contractual
obligations of the public
Regulatory Commission related to
motor carrier regulations
fortunate road safety
enforcement center to transfer
to the department of
transportation.
Department of transportation
already has a fairly extensive
a.
The transportation section may
regulate everything from
Driver education programs to
traffic safety and aviation
support so this combines all the
transportation functions under
one roof the actually these guys
we have to move this is a very
clean transfer of there's no
crossover I think there's about
fifteen employees involved but
they wouldn't have to change are
desperate to stay in the same
location it's just a change of
ministration function again all
the money transfers all the
regulations transfer most of the
bill scratching out PRC words
appropriating leading DOT richer
proprioception.
In essence that's what it does
It's a standalone entity and
they can even stay in the same
desks and they're very little
disruption there's no budgetary
costs to speak of.
All of the dollars that will
that are appropriated currently
for that particular function
will transfer over I have had
the PRC when probes to accompany
me in previous meetings as well
as representatives from the DOT
DOT supports the measure because
there's a mix of the PRC
commissioners and whether the
supporter do not support their
neutral imposition.
And essentially that's my
presentation and I would stand
for questions of that.
I don't know if I have the OAG
R. R. of PRC representation
online or not chair.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Madam web.
Do you have any comments or
would you like me to go to
public comment.
The.
Madam will be here
you hear muted.
Thank you the only thing I think
I would add is that active date
is January first of twenty
twenty three but besides that
I'm just getting up to speed and
I think that my at co sponsor
was very eloquent in describing
that the bill so it would that
will stand for questions.
Thank you we will now go to
public comment and we will hear
a comment and supported the bill
and Amanda I'm gonna ask you to
help me facilitate that and at.
Call on that and public
commenters thank you.
In your in our new.
Then you're going to have to and
you're on your and.
Thank you is the only one.
Okay thank you.
Do we have any at.
When we like to make a comment
in opposition.
There is.
Okay all right.
Thank you committee members.
You madam chair I move a do
pass.
We have a due pass motion by
Representative Eli.
And.
Second by Representative Madam
one guy it goes.
Representative Nibert.
Thank you madam chair
I do have a number of the.
Questions because this so.
Madam chair and senator
Representative.
Here I understand the full
effort you're really remove the
night pretty substantial portion
of the of.
Delegation of authority that
we've made to the public
regulation commission to the
department of transportation is
advised viewing this piece of
legislation correctly.
If that's a question I
the representative of.
As far as their total duties
their primary function is
utility regulation.
They spend I would guess ninety
five percent of their time on
utility regulations I don't have
any documentation to prove that
that's essentially what to what
they do we have historically if
you call Representative that we
have moved in the number of the
but I guess about three or four
different divisions from the PRC
because they were not able to
deal with utility regulations
adequately removed insurance
placed under DFA we are Marshall
out I think it's under public.
Public safety we move
corporations but that Under
Secretary of state this is
basically the last significant
division that to that we've
looked at and it really has very
little relationship within
eight to regulating utilities
and that's since we were trying
to get back to the old model we
had twenty some years ago and we
had a public utility commission
different name but it did the
same function of just yesterday
in the paper of the Attorney
General is again looking at the
PRC we've got to get these guys
focus on children's and that's
what the intent is to move the
constitutional amendment as you
probably know we reduce the
number of the commissioners down
to three they will be appointed
after an extensive process of
selecting qualified individuals
the final selection will be the
governor who will have to select
from the committee are from the
panelists provided to them by a
nominating committee are we
require a as I recall.
We require that to they have to
have advanced degrees or
extensive experience in utility
regulation so we're looking for
people who understand utilities
we want them to focus on your
children's that's the primary
function and I live in an area
where the PRC activities.
Affect our entire economy and
many other communities around
the state are in similar
situations help pay utility
bills we all pay a significant
part of our income matter what
your social status for your
economic stances in the low in
the state we all pay a
significant dollars in our
utility bills that's what we're
looking to get the PRC to focus
on.
Madam chair and senator
You have a long history of the
PRC has been.
One of registers the it's it's
kind of worked and flopped over
the years from elected to
appointed and the now we're
going back to appointed.
It's certainly been a.
Area that is been fraught with
the.
With concerns regarding.
Maybe improper dealings and and
the
bribery charges over the years
other things and and has been
under the microscope for four.
Decades actually
All right I know that.
Originally of.
As several entities got merged
corporation Commission that one
time got merged into a.
Public.
Regulation commission at
different things about we're
we're taking about
So I guess the vision for the
PRC is released to have it
focused on the public utilities
in the state and continued to
divest their of.
Those other areas that have been
under its jurisdiction but that
we but I are better.
Handled by other.
Agencies of state government so
I do this legislation it looks
like.
Any of the licensing of
regulations of COVID carriers
those are the.
Permits to be common carrier I
noticed ambulances and and other
folks at the our certificate Sir
permits to operate their
vehicles of the state would now
be going to the transportation
department for that permitting
process is that accurate.
That's exactly what we're trying
to do DOT already has a number
or a significant amount of
activity in in the
transportation which is
obviously what their primary
function.
The existence citizens to deal
with transportation issues this
is a very probably one of the
more.
Compatible transfers we've done
I'm not sure.
During the fire marshal where
they went where is and the
insurance where they went
necessaries compatibles this
transportation people in the DOT
or used the loans always
transportation issues this will
be different no doubt but
they're going to be able to
combine it again we're not
really changing anything except
for their address or their their
location on the supervision
there will be done that in the
changes over time as the
philosophy of the highway
commission begins to permeate
into this division but the
initial change.
I can't but this bill will be
better or worse in the long time
future but it will certainly
take some of the pressure of the
PRC and allow them to focus on
what we expect them to do when
we did the constitutional
amendment it does say regulate
utilities and other duties as
assigned and I'm paraphrasing it
didn't say that exactly but that
sure.
Thank you so.
That's so.
What we're trying to do is to to
streamline PRC fell right into
the what we expect them to do.
And by doing so I I guess one
one concern that that I I do
have use.
Over loading.
The transportation department
because as I see the
transportation department.
Their function.
Is truly to build and maintain
the vast road network that we
have in the state and coming
from southeast New Mexico in
district to that task has been a
and daunting task of.
We have have seen a huge as
everyone's aware in this
legislative body ever because of
the amount of money that's been
spent on roads and district to
last of five years through the
oil field traffic.
and that effort continues they
have been.
Really hard for us to to even
keep up with with that
construction and maintenance
work and so now we are.
Are putting into their laps.
A fairly significant.
Portion of the workload that
exist the PRC it that's keeping
up with Representative the.
All these licensing requirements
if you will and and permitting
processes that not just affect
the interstate trucking
operations but the after state
the end state.
Working operations as well as
ambulances and other folks that
need that the
It's a process the or whatever
the permits called to to operate
their their business in New
Mexico one one interesting
aerial page fifteen.
What I'm looking at the
amendment context version that
section thirteen of the bill.
Scary as.
Under this legislation ski area
operators shall file with the O.
T.
proof of financial
responsibility insurance and and
there's a whole section dealing
with risky areas Representative
are going to be handled by the
department of transport.
and that.
I don't mean to be facetious but
ski areas don't seem to be after
all the with the department that
is charged with maintaining and
building our our our road so.
And they don't necessarily fit
with power lines either
Representative that's true of
they do fit with insurance some
out possibly but the are you
just strikes me as audits are.
So the secretary D. R. T. is
that going to be charged with
the dealing with the the speaker
is around the state of the art
with some of that.
Another area but so maybe more
important.
in my part of the state because
we don't have the yep.
But we we don't have the best
numbers here is that we have in
northern New Mexico.
Madam chair just for a second
Representative Nibert.
Show that they're honoring
Debbie Armstrong and I just
wondered if we just take a brief
moment to just listen at the
house and hear them talking
about her just requirement for
you if you don't mind
representative Nibert I'm sure
sorry to interrupt you I'm I'm
doing or how I'm down here the
majority leader's office and I
didn't realize I was doing it so
I mean you for a minute we'll
just listen to.
Your.
Thank you.
The.
What.
All right everyone thank you
committee members and everyone
in the audience let's go ahead
and resume our committee meeting
thank you senator please
proceed.
Madam I'm not sure exactly where
we were I think we were
discussing a ski slopes or
something like that that's been
the history of the PRC is that
anything that so but we merge
the corporation and the do you
see a number of years ago and
that brought a lot of other
unrelated agencies together.
And over time we've added things
ski ski slopes is a good example
that to may or may not see that
they may not fit anywhere else
either but that's so that's been
the history so we've got an
agency that we try to streamline
and get them focused back to
where they need to be.
Well am in.
Getting that agency focused we
are doing it at the expense of
another agency which is now.
Going to be distracted with our
this override the of tasks that
the are really unrelated to the
roads and highways in the state
I just point out the ski areas
which you want to
Use out of their normal our
field of vision of we do provide
them with I'm sorry for
interrupting we do provide them
with the of the full staff and
appropriations and everything so
it's not like they're actually
not gonna be able to that that
they're not gonna have to come
up additional resources to do
this they've got all the
resources that just transfer
over.
So it shouldn't be an issue at
least initial.
Madam chairman and senator you
would agree that the of the
focus of the secretary it is now
going to have to be much broader
that just the.
Constructing and maintaining and
repairing roads bridges and
some of the other
more concentrated.
duties that we have at the
present time in which about a
group of I would agree the
secretary is in support of this.
I don't know if the sector is
online or not this committee
around this meeting around so I
wasn't able to get it all lined
up to its use online he making
respond that he's been
supporting through the other
committees we that.
Okay
I think we left off on page
twenty eight of the amendment.
Versions section nineteen of the
Legislation would see pipeline
safety bureau under D. O. T..
Our well that's a but that is
transportation of natural gas
that's produced in the state
Senator I know you're very
familiar with the with that
issued from our west
You know one could argue that
the it is transportation but it
certainly.
Of the.
Different brand are.
What's the deities palm of
certain.
Is there some correction of
language are we did not reflect
what state are you did not move
it we did not move by plants it
and where does that stay with
your C. PRC.
DOT didn't feel levels within
their purview.
It just that's new material I
assume to clarify some statutory
complex or whatever but.
Thank you for clarifying that it
looked to me like we were adding
up to a.
You know the drafters are they
like to clean up languages ago
and modernize statutes and so
forth right and then right under
that is of course railroads.
would be.
Move over.
And then the next page the
we we have.
In addition to railroads a
telephone and telegraph
companies.
Did not move we did not move
telecommunications
telecommunications are not
native they are not native
remove committee years
ambulances
taxis.
Okay.
That's the kind of things
removed.
Yes I saw the taxis and trucks.
Yes the number of pages for from
where we're at right now overall
rate of thirty five which is
section twenty five of.
The aviation yep yep moved over
or are present we have
in the department.
We under DOJ okay.
And I they currently have a.
director of that oversees all
the airports in the state if I
recall correctly that.
That's correct yes.
Section twenty eight is the
building point meant of.
And.
Building for spent the regular
the regulatory aspects of that
or B. move to D. O. T..
And I guess my my question
really is sure Representative
really be more appropriately
elected to the department of
public safety.
Which so I'm sorry which section
or what a jury on just.
Section twenty eight.
The field force of the motor
transportation act and motor
carrier act and the authority
that we grant to them to make
rules and regulations well my
question is.
You know where move in that
aspects should that really be
department of public safety or
should it be the department of
transportation of I guess that
should be available
Representative it's all.
Part of that division and we'd
rather than piecemeal division
we kept the whole division
together.
Well are the of motor the.
Motor transportation.
Police I don't know what their
formal name is are they under
DPS survey of those are the PS
and they they were merged a few
years ago with state police
motor transport right and and so
it just seems to me that may be
of your if this rulemaking
authority
Zacks you have the
motor transportation officers
are.
Enforcing those acts
it might be worth a look to make
sure that the regulatory
authority follows so we're goes
to the correct department yeah I
don't know enough about that
too.
Find.
Any real knowledge it just to
make sure that I thought point
out.
When we get to.
Further over see some ambulances
taxis
In here
Those.
The taxi cab rules and
regulations also apply to the
our lift them uber
All right.
We had it listed over a few
years ago.
And I think that was then
statutory through the
legislature not to the PRC and I
honestly can't answer your
question accurately how that's
how that's regulated.
I think we did including but I.
Would stand corrected if I'm
wrong on that Mr chair what are
madam chairman so
Representative.
Well I would.
All right I will make an
assumption that I'm looking at
page the fifty six.
Which is.
A paragraph triple C..
We'll see four says a
specialized passenger service I
I I would make the assumption
that that so you're aware of
that we were.
I passenger service vehicles
I don't know that for I would
just make that assumption going
here.
You know I look at the that
number pages the department of
transportation is going to have
its work cut out for it of
getting this thing
getting its arms around all
this.
The bears the OAG have the space
availability to accommodate it
the move of the I. DS
Department.
From the PRC for the quarters to
the the R. T. offices you know
miss madam chair representative
Representative they don't have
to move of their standalone
Division based exactly where
they are.
Of their money stays the same
there regulations state the same
there will stay the same their
contracts and saying nothing
changes other than their
supervisors the I was told by
director approach that to it's
just it's a standalone Division
separately housed and it doesn't
have to move or do any it's very
clean that's why we've done it
this way it's very clean simple
a change where we didn't have to
in size in the school people
that are have time here at
halftime there none of that
exists so it's a it's a very
simple from the standpoint of
the physical part of this very
simple.
That that particular division is
standalone and it just now will
become directed by the secretary
of state.
Thank thank you for that
information I I have the when I
read the legislation hi that.
Made an assumption that those
folks were house with the PRC
and of course they might have to
change their their the place are
recently and I I just thought
that there would be some group
this is a great benefit separate
building where all these people
are performing their functions
and those same people will just
put a different name over the
door that's right okay thank
thank you for clarifying.
All
of the
Couple other things that
Representative probably have
some pool of.
I guess it could go either way
but like your the traffic safety
bureau.
I I I could see how that might
be important with respect to D.
O. T. I could also see where
that the important yes for the
department of public safety.
looks like some of those
functions will be and DO chief
now I think they currently are
Representative.
The traffic safety bureau that
bureau is a currently under DOT
okay so so that that change
that's correct.
I
think that's all the questions I
have on the bill of self I just
have a couple general questions
madam chair
Madam chair and senator.
The PRC feel about this
legislation have they been have
they testify to help expressed
any of.
of their own thoughts there's
two.
The extraction of this portion
of their oversight to the DOT.
As I understand there have been
three of the current
commissioners are expression of
opinion to in favor we want to
folks and so they have taken a
neutral position since the.
Don't have a unanimous position
one way or the other and up.
Correct approach has been that
by hearing previously I don't
know if he's online now are not
to if the issue certainly ask
him what what the Indians are
but to that Sir the way I
understand it from his testimony
previously.
When you refer to director folks
are are props you.
Are referring to the.
He's with the PRC now is the I
think this totals executive
director of the PRC okay our
kids are used to be with another
agency that's right but I might
go but he's a director of the
PRC so so it sounds like that
there may.
Some desire among commissioners
to to do is use stated in the
very beginning baby be more
focused on a few issues and the
we willing to divest itself of
some others are somewhat in
related areas of of of of
responsibility maybe one they
feel otherwise
Madam chair of this is this is
is a pretty substantial change
the.
Some of it online some of the
the R. I'm not sure that I
really of the.
I agree with.
Some of it I do think is
It is warranted
I I do hope
madam chair and senator I do
hope that we are keep our eye on
this and and make sure that
through this process.
That the department of
transportation does not lose its
focus.
Because I think.
Take your Lee and yeah
our area.
We we recognize how vital.
It is to have.
I will use.
And highways that are adequately
maintained to not only bring
goods and services and our
community but but it opens up
opportunities for economic
development to export our goods
out of our community and so are
we we we really feel strongly
that we do need.
Urban of transportation really
can we focus on on that mission
because it really.
Goes and with our ability as a
community to sustain ourselves
and to hopefully grow and
prosper and without the those
interconnections not only with
other cities of the state but
with interconnections to
other states and and other
communities are we will have a
very difficult time tracking.
Manufacturing and other.
Businesses to locate here that
are part of the state so with
that Madam chair representative
bring does have some questions
if you would put him on the list
my questions are are finished
thank you senator thank you
Representative for your thank
you.
Representative Rehm.
Chair and senator I want to go
back and reaches the D. O. T.
moving over that section twenty
eight you were talking about.
With Representative night for
and in particular I'm trying to
understand what exactly is
moving over are the our current
officers that are under the
state police where we know
we're.
Madam chair representative no
this doesn't have anything to do
with the state police or the
motor.
Motor trans what used to be
murdered trans they we have
merged motor trans with state
police they are state police
officers now even though some
have functions that deal with
trucking and and whatever they
do but so that has nothing to do
with this legislation this
legislation is strictly to do
with common carriers so trucks
ambulances those kind of things
putting that's that separate
divisions currently under PRC
moving it.
Administratively not physically
moving it but administratively
recurring it under DH.
And
Which street the port of entries
because now you're moving those
psycho madam chair and senator
the bill I guess you're gonna
take the port of entries and
move them under DOT is that the
plan.
No Representative madam chair
they currently are under DOT
we're not changing that at all
and that's one of the things
that is under DOT along with
aviation along with stuff.
Driver's education classes
there's a lot of transportation
activities that don't relate to
highways that are already under
division under the motor the
culture motel mobile division
under New York state this will
become I assume part of that.
That function under DOT.
And madam chair and senator
Neville you want to mention that
they're going to move the
tow trucks under DOT is that
correct that's correct that's
part of the the move that's part
of the division that is right
now under the PRC regulations
our administration.
Madam chair and senator bill I I
agree we need to move all the
stuff I there you know the PRC
yeah you too many items under a
door different things to manage
and I don't feel they were
managing.
Many of them even.
With the possible.
You know the tow truck industry
was one of all of we had a lot
of complaints as to what is
occurring with.
I'm not sure that perhaps they
should be moved under law
enforcement where they could be
inspected more of more closely
but
at least maybe would DO T. they
will start
auditing them and and watching
what they're doing are up
complaints from individuals on
vehicle to said.
The toes were quite expensive
yet you can go to the.
Our phone book.
And you know for forty five
dollars so I can go ahead and
get it to go
the from my house to the
dealership or whatever but does
the what they term the non
consensual codes we're several
hundred dollars you know you
were involved in a traffic crash
or something like that.
That scheme just doesn't seem
that step right.
So I'm glad that we're we're
making some of these changes
are.
I'm just a.
the you know I I think that we
probably need some more but.
You you have a large enough
bills.
For for this year.
So just out of curiosity what's
the next build it'll look like
that sure Senator.
Well Madam chair representative
of we try to make this mistake
as we possibly could so that you
guys would have something to do
over there in the house you know
that it's.
Well thank you madam chair of
thank you to senator Neville.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Representative so more as a
question to.
The duration of the year.
Representative Zamora.
Thank you madam chair where all
three in one office of the state
it because in always.
Heaters on not would just
sharing the one so.
What.
Madam chair and senator why is
it so important to do these
changes now why why did this
wait till till the P. R. job
structure the PRC got change and
and how they got a point.
Madam chair representative it's
it's philosophical us because we
wanted to make sure that the new
P. Garcia didn't have to start
off at trying to deal with a lot
of changes of things that might
need to be done in their first a
first year of the operation we
wanted to make it as clean as
possible this will fairly well
Whittle them down to regulating
utilities telecommunication
activities.
Mostly related a relatively
closely related activities as
far as fees and those kind of
things.
Representative Nibert talked
about the importance of highways
that is part of the world my
part of the world PRC activities
are very important we have two
large our plants we have lots of
pipelines those kind of things
the PRC will be dealing with and
that certainly affects the
people in Albuquerque
Albuquerque citizens are under
the PNM but they certainly want
to make sure that their rates
are are fair and proper and that
the utility functions we've got
talk now about brown outs and
black outs and all kinds of
things those are the kind of
things that the PRC needs to
make sure it never happens and
we want to make sure that the
new PRC has they're going to be
a steep learning curve right
away we want to get all this
done so that they don't have to
deal with these kind of issues
day one they can started when
they first get on online and get
to work and I can start working
working by looking at utilities
and making sure that the systems
have a adequate power utilities
in their homes.
And thank you for that answer
Senator not and madam chair and
and hello this is this is
hindsight but if we would have
done this before what do you
think the PRC could survive the
white structure now
you I I don't know exactly when
it was a scene like this under
governor Richardson we used to
have a P. UC public utility
commission that did what we're
trying to get the PRC back to
they regulated utilities then we
decided to merge them with the
corporation commission of the
process picked up all of these
other activities transportation
issues the slopes all those
things and they've been I guess
because the word regulations of
the title they were assigned to
the public Mr this excuse me the
PRC the public Regulatory
Commission and so as a result
we've got this agency that has
a committee focuses for too many
things I have to pay attention
to we need to get them back to
utilities that's a major major
part of the economy in New
Mexico.
And the life blood of of our
state as far as keeping up
keeping the lights on keeping
our economy going we have to
have a good utility system and
we need to regulatory agency
that takes care of that and
focuses on that and is it
involved with all these other
distractions.
And and I agree with you on
chairman and senator I agree
with you on that and the thank
you for bringing this bill
fourth and and that concludes my
questions chair thank you.
Thank you.
We have a motion for it to pass
motion by Representative Eli we
have a second by madam went
great
is there any objection to the do
passed motion.
We show all present voting in
the affirmative Senator you have
a do pass on Senate bill one
ninety eight as amended.
I thank you thanks committee.
Thank you.
Okay now we will go to.
Building on Senate bill
fourteen.
Representative is very we have
Representative small.
Madam chair this is Senator
Stewart Senator Stewart okay I
started off I think
Representative small we're gonna
tag team this because we're both
on multiple committees but I'm
going to start this morning okay
and I know you're in the middle
of it so I'll just sit here
ready for questions unless you
want me to do anything else.
I think we can raise them with
questions committee members.
Chair of the.
Are you Representative Nibert if
you don't mind what I was gonna
say is because I think it'll
affect the discussion madam
chair is to have an amendment.
That I think I would like to
move.
For discussion purposes let me
give you the two oh two number
that way as Representative
Nighbor **** it can include
questions based on this
amendment it's two two two seven
nine four point two.
and all all right she
Representative divers for the
route I'll go a little slower
just see make sure he's got it
let me let me just read it
because it's not long
the title is of section sixty
would add a section six
temporary provision authorizing
the temporary acquisition or
operation of new resources or
utilization of utility
facilities.
Previously approved for
abandonment to maintain system
reliability requirements and the
section itself says on a
verified statement filed on or
before March tenth twenty twenty
three from an electric public
utility to the public regulation
commission of anticipated system
operating in adequacy or
a potential resource shortfall
to serve retail customer loads
no approval shall be required
for the public utility require
or operate new resources on a
temporary basis for up to one
year or extend the service life
of public utility plant that is
received abandonment approval
for up to four months during the
calendar year twenty twenty two
provided that the right recovery
for the reasonable cost of such
actions shall be subject
commission review in future
proceedings what this is just
madam chair just so and members
the committee and sponsors this
is the ability to extend the
life of the of the of the plant
off by one year recognizing that
there has been any concern about
brown ouch and this is intended
to provide some flexibility and
address that concern
and then sure you would you want
me to second for this I just
wanted to put that amendment out
there so that is we're
discussing it we can discuss the
bill along with the amendment
and I appreciate madam chair
very much courtesy let me kind
of jump thank you.
Thank you Representative do we
have discussion on the amendment
I'll move the amendment for
discussion.
You are and while secondhand and
I see representative Nibert.
For a discussion with your
doctor to to issue madam chair
can make them small
they are very.
Thank you.
So so just to make your make it
clear is just so one year
extension or a four month pre
pre yeah I was I'm madam chair
and representative I was
confused as to what Santa this
ammendment it is one year the
four months is in twenty twenty
two.
So it is a one year extension
that's correct.
But I think the language for
months is a technical concern
twenty times you honest with you
I don't really know I know this
is Dan quarter over make it on
the languages correct copy of
the amendment yes and.
And now.
Madam chair representative is it
in the share file printed out.
R. the staff has.
Committee members.
And it's also Mr Pyle.
I believe and it did you send
this ammendment out.
Yes the amendment that sent out
it should ensure file and
everybody's that box.
Thank.
That is very.
Thank you.
Yes today's date okay.
It makes it easier since I've
been running around a bunch
Madam chair representative like
we could do it the old fashioned
way I could run it up to it
what what are you you may run it
out to me.
so so that might be more of a
run the new welfare enough I'm
not doing that I'm looking at
this job file for that and I see
us be one the US B. one hundred
of steady on before so under
which of those files would be
located.
Hi Representative I write for SB
fourteen look under February
fourteenth twenty twenty two the
state yeah my mistake I thought
you meant for the.
Sports.
There are three of the one fifty
nine the one on three S. C.
forty one.
For our.
Just be.
February fourteenth on the
shared drive.
David do you just want to email
him directly yeah I'll re email
the amendment thank you.
You know I wonder if madam chair
I wonder if you couldn't I just
don't know if you could just
share the document on soon and
just put up on the screen it's
it's a one page amendment.
Like share the screen yeah and
just share the screen and put it
up.
I know we haven't done that
before but it would give
everybody the opportunity to see
it.
And madam chair I just emailed
Representative sniper the
amendment.
Those are more technologically
savvy just brought a
Copy of a piece of paper and
so so there are those certified
bang for their we can't find
them.
Okay
So while owner before.
About two weeks from now.
No Madam chair representative
that's not true it's March tenth
twenty twenty three okay a year
from now yes Sir.
It.
Madam chair representative of
the four months.
I I I'm not understanding how.
Work received abandonment
approval for up to four months
during the calendar year twenty
twenty two.
The.
As of the approval being granted
to
Lows the four corners plant.
It is about the the issue is
that I I have approval to close
a plant and this effort is to
extend.
The ability to produce from that
plant.
Madam chair representative
rather than take a shot at
guessing Representative small I
think is hopefully with us and I
think she can answer that
question because he was involved
in a change.
Madam chair you also have
several experts online you have
Sander the lady you have other
people they all can answer that
also.
If we could bring up that's an
excellent point thank you
president thank you Sandra Ely
would you like to provide
comment.
Yes madam chair representative.
One generating station is
supposed to retire this summer
this would expand their ability
by four months to operate
from June thirtieth through
October thirtieth so the
abandonment issues for San Juan
for twenty twenty two only.
A large I sure wish it so the.
Madam chair representative thank
you read the language it's so
specific you can only apply to
those that plant that is
received abandoned approval I
can imagine as many plants
that's gotta be sent one I don't
think it has to mention San Juan
and probably is more appropriate
for to have a language it does
but I.
A map that take a look if you
want to change language but I
think we one run by the sponsors
say been involved in the
discussions.
And madam chair that's just the
way we do things we don't put
thanks bye come by their name in
the US statute so this is the
plant that has an abandonment
plan and that's what this is
for.
That yeah that's not my concern
my concern is the.
Weinberg says.
The plant that has received
abandonment approval for up to
four months during the calendar
year.
Madam chair representative you
have to read the entire sentence
it says operating resources on a
temporary basis or for one year
or extend the service life and
that's the phrase you wanna make
sure to include of the public
utility plant that has received
abandonment proprioceptive
performance during the calendar
year twenty twenty two.
So that does make sense.
We are.
Yes Representative I dropped to
the state extend the service
life for up to four months I
have a public utility.
Your is tied to the.
What you're well okay as long as
everybody's clear that that the
that plant would be able to
operate from June you said June
thirtieth October first.
I'm looking at I thought that's
what so maybe misuse of our.
Madam chair representative
Nibert that's correct so so so
this this is the bandaid to our.
Deal with the.
Potential ground out issues that
they're been a highlighted that
that respect for the last couple
weeks Mr madam chair and
representative that is exactly
right you have to act fast.
Where are.
Madam chair Representative
Zamora have some questions on
the amendment on I have no
further questions.
Thank you I don't see any of
their virtual hands up for
discussion is there any this
year Representative for a while
state Representative Zamora.
Thank you thank you madam chair.
Thank you thank you
Representative.
The Ezzell.
So madam chair and
representative I understand your
amendment we we just went
through that and and for the
testimony from.
Representative Nibert on it but
how how do you think it's going
to physically work for the
plant.
Are we gonna ask them to to get
ready to run but shut down and
how do they do that in the
process of they're gonna shut
down they're going to do the
things physically to I assume
they're gonna do things
physically they're not have a
budget coal stacked to have
machinery removed to so so how
are how's that process going to
take place Madam chair
representative I really with all
due respect I don't think that's
on the and we're not I'm not
hearing you Representative near
me now.
You are you are not able to hear
me.
Representative.
Hello.
Representative the lack the sign
of that on so I'm hoping
representatives more can hear me
Representative so why give me a
thumbs up or down you can't okay
so I don't think that's on the
amendment my suggestion is those
are the questions this this
ammendment literally just gives
people options you're not I did
with all due respect you will
still be able to ask that
question.
Well my suggestion to you would
be allow the amendment to be
adopted and then ask the
question that way so we move on
from the amendment this
literally just gives options and
then that same question could be
applied to the bill is adopted.
Madam chair and representative
and I understand all that but
that's the reality of it is is
we're sent rules up here in the
capital and then we expect.
The the I just emergency of of
no maybe a brown out.
We're shutting down but we're
keeping an open and and.
We have to go one way or the
other with that make this make
this work with the for the plant
not just.
Physically work for the point so
we to keep it open we don't.
And madam chair representative
all know questions that if you
want to address some I think
they go to the bill as amended
let's adopted and then have the
chair call on you and you can go
right back to it this is
literally just about giving some
flexibility to what we're doing
that all of those questions that
you would have apply does that
make sense I'm not stopping you
from asking any questions it
just doesn't go to the amendment
I just I figure they pertain to
the amendment and thank you
madam chair and thank you
representative madam chair
without I would move adoption of
the amendment.
Thank you.
To drive the amendment and we
have a second and.
Is there any objection to
adopting them and that.
We have an adopted amendment and
we will go back to the bill as
amended.
Committee members.
Madam chair I think it's more
for the Bob.
Okay back to Representative
Nibert.
Thank you madam chair.
Madam chair and and senator of.
We left all of.
I just started asking a few
questions I think we we left off
with.
Some questions regarding our the
the real focus of the bill was
to establish a carbon credit
scheme
and really did not
Mandate that fuels be.
We although the representative
pointed out that the.
There were some flexibility
there are maybe there's some
effort to support our.
There's some effort to.
maybe encouraging some.
You may be less carbon intensive
I think those are his words that
what are currently years but but
primarily the way I view it and
the and I think I got some
agreement on it it was really a
scheme that sets up a carbon
credit type system where the.
parties who would be
producing.
These carbon fuels.
Would.
Have to purchase.
Carbon credits from another
individual through a in that
sense of government type.
Create a commodity skiing on the
open market and and the I think
that's where we left off if
anybody.
I can remember better than I
please tell me so I don't the.
repeat myself.
I I see Representative small is
yours are is that where we left
off Representative.
I thank you madam chair thank
you Representative Nibert yes
and we just also made the point
of electrification was
penetrating more deeply and more
quickly but that's what you
described is also active.
Right.
Thank you
So I'm not going to go over
All the map that was drawn over
the other day work with
Representative Rehm.
But I think I think that the
testimony was about a hundred
fourteen gallons of gasoline the
fourth one metric ton of CO two
combusted that the right now
California use of marketing.
CO two credits for about two
hundred dollars I think yes
monies hundred sixty to two
hundred dollars per metric ton.
and the.
Really.
Or where it's to about a dollar
eighty increase to the price of
gasoline if we're doing a twenty
percent reduction that's thirty
six cents per gallon.
If I calculate it right if you
but it's a thirty percent
reduction that's required
I think the twenty years that's
about fifty four cent per gallon
increases in the price of
gasoline per gallon so
This.
This system that's being
credited here at.
Yes if fully implemented.
Madam chair and and senator it
will result your M. those who
purchase gasoline to pay at
higher price as a result of the
credit stating that serves up
for them legislation what if
not.
So madam chair I'm gonna answer
for for a little bit and then
I'm gonna have to turn it over
to us to Representative small
which I appreciate very much and
being on there that is not
what's happened in California
and it's not what's happened in
other states I mean amazing to
me is you probably can't see
this of course it's backwards is
how much cheaper in California
some of these clean fuels are
this is a dollar and a half
cheaper is E. eighty five
ethanol dollars cheaper than the
biodiesel that's the normal fuel
the studies in Oregon have said
that they think it's about three
point seven cents more per
gallon when you look at the ten
years California has had a clean
fuel standard they think it's
about nineteen cents over in
years that can be attributable
to the clean fuel standard
there's all kinds of reasons why
gasoline prices go up this will
not be one of the this will
drive prices down we have twenty
eight companies who want to
either expand or move here
because this is a move for the
future to reduce intensity of
carbon in our fuels and to clean
up the air so you can do all the
math you want that this from
California showing you you'd
save a dollar and a half per
gallon on your ethanol so I just
don't believe that's true yeah
it could be the minimalist you
know a few cents a might be
attributable to what about the
rest of that is attributed to
world market prices etcetera so
you know.
I just don't believe that you're
talking points are accurate
based on the origins study based
on California so this is just an
argument about mass I don't know
who's going to win on it.
Well Representative madam chair
and senator
Matt but Matt.
The map is about and so.
Do you do you have a better
figure for the price of a carbon
credit in California.
Madam chair I do not I have the
data from what they think has
been the ten years of what's
happening California but I don't
have the a better price for the
credit we're we're going to do a
New Mexico credit we're not just
gonna wholesale take on other
states what they've done it's
going to look different in New
Mexico this is a new thing for
us to do and we're going to take
her time up to two years we are
going to look at the other
states we're going to bring in
the science behind this we have
companies that want to move here
to produce better fuel you can
grant all you want about me out
about this but we have twenty
eight companies to set you do
this for moving to New Mexico
one of them has an open plant
ready to go and close us this is
the world market we are moving
to clean up the carbon in our
fuels so that we have better
health better air and so that we
can promote these industry here
in New Mexico so
I'm all in.
Madam chair and senator
When was that photograph taken
and could you tell us what the
prices are on that sign.
Yes so madam chair the the one
that's the cheapest is E. eighty
five ethanol and it's three
dollars and nineteen cents a
gallon.
the bio diesel the twenty which
is your normal not the playing
field is four dollars and
seventy nine cents.
And the others.
Well regular gasoline I mean
these are the ones that you
compare the bio diesel and the
eighty five us and all of the
other ones are from this is
regular gas not building fuels
right and one of those prices
ma'am.
They are four dollars and sixty
nine cents for a chevron car
regular is four dollars and
seventy nine cents if you have
credit and debit up that's the
and then for supreme it's four
dollars and ninety nine cents
and five dollars and nine cents
depending upon cash several card
or credit debit but this is not
a clean fuels this is down here
at the three dollars and
nineteen cents.
Yes and and madam chair and
senator of those those numbers
are slightly less than the
number size stall on similar
signs in California about the.
a month in sixteen days ago that
they were all in the
hi for dollar and our up to five
fifty at the particular stations
are was looking at.
But madam chair and and senator
the eighty five year old is our
eighty five percent of the
knowledge that correct.
Madam chair I don't know that
level of detail and I'm sorry
but I'm going to have to keep it
over to Representative small
please be nice to him and don't
take all day thank you so much.
There and and the representative
of the eighty five our fuel is
that eighty five percent
ethanol.
Madam chair representative
Nibert I believe that's the case
but I would also I know we have
Missy lie on and so for some of
the technical pieces if.
But I believe that's right.
Okay all right if you'll take my
word for it that is the case
And so it's basically fifteen
percent
Folium.
gasoline and eighty five percent
of at the mall
madam chair madam chair and and
Representative
How many of that all plants were
built in New Mexico in the last
thirty years.
Do you have any ideas that how
many up and all plants we have
in New Mexico one time.
Madam chair representative
Nibert I don't I don't know that
number.
I don't know that number either.
But I can tell you there were up
in all plants and Rossell there
were open all plants in Clovis
there was a very large up and
all plant for tell us and I
believe in several other
communities in the state.
You know how many up and all
plants are operating they of the
state of New Mexico.
Madam chair representative I've
read I don't.
Are there are not any ethanol
plants operating in the state of
New Mexico today
In fact
Most of those former open all
plants that were were bills that
have been dismantled R. the
ethanol plant number tell us
which is just south of our the
rodeo grounds that eastern New
Mexico university
it is still a sizeable structure
are it is I don't know which it
is capable of being operated
media please but it does still
exist
So the the the.
The transition to to alcohol
based based fuels that we're
used in New Mexico our.
They did not expect we've worked
out of the market place maybe
maybe maybe this effort is one
that will revive that industry
but it it was one that had a
tortured Paschim in eastern New
Mexico anyway in the last thirty
years of and they have one that
are held high hopes and and.
Ultimately of.
Good.
But the.
We're doing a little far field
but madam chair and and
Representative.
You know if that is our goal is
to try to grow our crops to
sustain.
These ethanol based fuels
that has some some of.
Inherent issues our first of all
you can buy alcohol based the
eighty five fuels and in many
states California is one in the
Midwest.
Alcohol the eighty five
of fuel is is readily available.
But it comes at a cost of.
You pay three nineteen per
gallon according to our Senator.
But your mileage is going to be
substantially less your your
fuel mileage is substantially
less because there's less energy
being produced from that fuel
so there's some other trade offs
that earth so
you can't just look at the price
and say that's what it cost for
me to go from Roswell New Mexico
to Santa Fe.
Because with the eighty five
fuel you're going to burn more
gallons thank you work with that
other other fuel and that's why
most absolutely the only content
of ten percent alcohol but again
that's so.
A little bit.
Down the road I had mentioned
that the that so those those
types of questions.
Madam chair representative yet
this legislation is passed.
Do you believe that this would.
Result yeah I'm.
Our rail lines.
Moving their refueling
operations to surrounding states
that would not be subject to the
same guidelines.
Madam chair representative now.
And madam chair and
representative of you're you're
familiar with a fairly
substantial refueling operation
in your community argue about
Madam chair representative yes
one of the largest intermodal
stations.
Refuelling stations if so it's.
Excuse me.
Madam chair and representative
That refuelling station madam
was moved from el Paso to
of New Mexico and member years
ago for the main line of the
Union Pacific there and I don't
know how many of.
How many gallons of diesel.
Our fuel that that facility but
I suspected substantial
I I think I would maybe take
issue with with your response
because it if we are forcing.
right feeling appropriations to
consider those things have that
operation has to bear.
Of.
The rate of purchasing carbon
credits to.
To accommodate the sales of that
diesel.
Then it would seem to me that
that is going to be a factor in
determining the economics of
where that fuel and that by
occur outside of the of New
Mexico so I'm a little concerned
about the.
Chair sorry Representative my
understanding is that this does
not pertain to rail travel one
madam chair and rail
transportation madam chair
Interstate rail travel at that
madam chair representative
Nibert number one and number two
Madam chair representative
Nibert
independently
the.
You Pacific BNSF in other
freight rail carriers are also
is my understanding seeking to
decarbonise their transportation
so one madam chair
representative Nibert
My understanding that this does
not apply to rail so so we will
we need not worry about it
there.
And.
that should in answer to your
question.
Well madam chair and
representative Garcia and
section two.
UP paragraph do.
That clean fuel standards means
a standard apple Google to
transportation fuels.
I don't see anything in here
that were.
Limit that only two highway.
You'll.
and I did not recall soon.
I would thank you madam chair
representative for I go to Mr
Eli to offer an additional
comment on that Representative.
Madam chair representative line
for the definition for
transportation fuels should be
looked at and it does reference
the department of transportation
regulations.
Transportation fuels
electricity.
Yes.
What would you also wanted an
opportune the state in New
Mexico.
Intended for motor vehicle use.
So the to the rail lines are
excluded from.
Yes that.
As would Errol.
That's correct you also have to
look at the definition Madam
chair representative Nibert of
more vehicles about.
Creative recruited at least two
exemptions.
With respect to clean fuels.
you missed legislation by
limiting that to motor vehicles
that the the average New Mexico
would be utilized.
Is that correct.
Go ahead Misia.
Just a minute.
Or Madam chair representative
Nibert.
We're we're keeping it
Specifically focused on the
areas madam chair representative
Nibert first where the highest
emissions are number one the
track in the transportation
sector into Madam chair
representative Nibert in the
areas where
it's it most efficient easiest
and economically valuable to
decarbonise.
Well.
Okay sensitive this is focused
on motor vehicles.
Do you think that this
legislation would have the
effect of.
Trucks traveling through our
state stopping at truck stops.
Which side of the state instead
of within the state.
Madam chair representative
Nibert.
The
I I don't think so Madam chair
representative Nibert the reason
that I don't think so is
because.
For that interstate travel there
is already again folks are
moving to decarbonise
the fuel sources that and Madam
chair representative Nibert I
think the choice about where and
when to refuel is driven
by what the tank shows.
Primarily public and madam chair
representative yes so for a few
reasons I don't I don't
necessarily think so.
Well
madam chair and and
Representative.
I I think to a large extent the
quantity of fuel that those
trucks are capable of caring.
I think one major factor is is.
The price of fuel at various
places and just like in my own
travels.
There's places I stopped our
voices I don't stop due to the
price of the fuels
Representative that I would be
putting into my vehicle and and
so are.
For instance I generally try to
make it all the way back to
Roswell without going up because
I don't want to pay an extra
twenty cents involved.
I've done that before but I
generally try to we've
Albuquerque or Santa Fe with
sufficient amount of gas to get
right all the way to my home.
So those I think even trucking
companies take into
consideration those things and
I'm concerned that if we are
increasing.
The price of diesel.
In the case of truck stops
and.
Price of gasoline for for most
of motor vehicles Representative
people will will consider that
as they travel across the
country
yeah and and the.
I I think those decisions are
are made based upon the market
price sometimes you have to pay
the higher price because you are
empty but generally happen
people try to plan the their
trips and in fuel that place is
that right I may be the best.
will we'll get off of that.
On page for it so here
Representative J. so.
It section two of the bill.
graphs.
Yes it's K..
I I found it interesting in your
discussion with Representative
reading that you talked about
the feedstocks and that took a
turn that but I didn't quite
understand
so we're talking about fuel
pathway transportation fuels
including big start generation
or extraction and I thought the
discussion term for
I started well before time is
that really what we're talking
about.
Madam chair representative
Nibert is at the part of it the
methane generated from livestock
waste is absolutely right
Prime to be a fuel source Madam
chair representative Nibert is
definitely the the pathway here
that you look to in K. A. I
think more really more focuses
on
bio fuels.
And the the some of the first
iterations including from F. and
on others where the carbon
intensity especially in the
earliest versions outweighed the
decarbonisation that is all the
inputs kind of outweighed the
the carbon reductions from
burning of the fuel Madam chair
representative Nibert I think
it's one of the great things
here about this bill is that the
fuel pathways the lifecycle
emissions will be considered in
determining the carbon intensity
for the fuels so I think we this
is really
Applied learning and applying.
The best practices on
decarbonisation.
So Madam chair representative
when I go back to my community
that has the.
well.
Maybe have more of dairy cattle
then we have people of do I need
to tell the very man that the
they too may have to get in this
carbon are
Purchasing business because of
the cattle that are on their
property.
Madam chair representative
Nibert no.
Well I'm a bit under I'm a bit
perplexed because you were
talking about livestock earlier
and.
So I understand their chattel
maybe maybe a concern
I just.
Need to know what I need to help
with their admin and
F. I community with respect to
that issue I suspect
Representative Zamora to
represents many dairies and in
his district by to the side.
Thank you madam chair thank you
representative Nibert that you
can thank
At help connect them madam chair
representative and I were
hopefully to the private sector
stakeholders who are looking to
invest in New Mexico
to create cleaner fuels in who
may very well be interested in
utilizing them and nor from the
dairies as part of that effort.
So madam chair representative
Nibert to help them bring
another
Source of revenue.
after passage of this bill.
Well but
and the generation of.
Your at eight Gary.
Is a carpet generator.
Not a Carmen sent.
Yeah and and so.
I just need to be in a position
to address questions they may
have sent Sir and the question
the other day you brought up.
Use your wives.
Because when I first read the
bill I did see livestock you.
Be quite honest with you.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative Nibert at.
There again there is
If that there is choose to sell
or they're MNU are for
generation of transportation
fuels then this will they will
be the ones you have bringing
new sources of revenue to their
operations Madam chair
representative Nibert there's
obviously no requirement that
they do so
that's part of SB fourteen but
but madam chair this hopefully
will open up new opportunities
to generate new income source.
The the
New income sources that the I
have been made aware of Madam
chair representative with
respect to
We we we know our that is
produced are very important
Generally involves the.
M. version of that.
But newer through various
processes to capture methane met
in is extracted from the
decomposition of the of the door
and that selling the methane and
two of the the market place so I
guess there could be some other
types of things that could occur
but the that's the.
Only.
Issue that I think that worked
out.
In my area or at least I where.
Madam chair and representative
over on
page five section three.
Representative C..
The third line down just a
little technical correction I
think you need the plural on the
second jurisdiction.
So just a comment.
Thank.
On page search services
Paragraph
The two.
Madam chair representative could
you explain
This provision and and how that
is going to work.
Thank you we with respect to
Fuels originating in another
state.
Thank you madam chair
representative Nibert I turn
that question over to Sandra Ely
please.
Madam chair representative
Nibert in particular are you
talking about it does not
discrimination discriminate
against fuels on the basis of
having originated in another
jurisdiction yeah it says it's
going to is that the US were to
establish across those.
To determine these infants
values.
For transportation fuels that is
not discriminate on fuels
you are at and where are read it
was whether they were purchased
instead of region are but I
would Senator purchased in our
state or another state.
So the members may I interrupt
for a minute Representative
Nibert pardon me for
Time sake we have approximately
an hour to conclude this hearing
so if we could just be
respectful of time and this is
the third day that we've been
discussing this matter so
we're gonna have a hard stop in
about an hour thank you.
Madam chair representative by if
I may this language simply
states
carbon intensity values on
transportation fuels will be
assessed equally for those
sources of fuels those fuels
generated in New Mexico and
those coming from another
jurisdiction.
That we will not discriminate
against fuels generated in other
jurisdictions this is in part to
make sure that we are not in
violation of the dormant
Commerce Clause.
Okay
The process of determining
carbon intensity values I.
Yes that means you're you're
just gonna look at fuels that
are available here as well as
fuels a baby here lies from from
other states but by come across
our state is that.
Madam chair representative
Nibert that's correct okay.
Down below program I.
That is the mechanism that this.
Carbon.
Carbon credit scheme gets built
and there will be a market place
to.
so and to purchase the carbon
credits and so it in that regard
Would.
Farmers and ranchers in New
Mexico be able to sell.
Carbon credits on the market.
Madam chair representative
Nibert.
Thank you for that there they'll
be.
Roughly two years perhaps
slightly less at to set up the
the rules of the road as it were
as it pertains to these Madam
chair representative diver I'm
not opposed to for for again
those new sources of income for
producers to have those but I
don't think what I can say that
they will or will not be the
those were opportunities will or
will not exist right now.
Madam chair representative
Nibert.
You madam chair.
Madam chair representative of.
I would hope that this effort
would not be just to limit it to
the very few who can.
Capture and sequester large
volumes of of carbon dioxide but
may be available to others to
through.
Like in your community as of
money capture carbon through
natural means by growing trees
your your con orchards and the
Los crucis area Representative.
Of.
Probably do a calculation as to
determine how much carbon is
captured in each one of those
trees are on a yearly basis
we're certainly over time.
and and I just wanted to.
Reporter for doing this I just
wanna make sure that the we're
not just looking at.
Some big your big operations
that are going to capture you
know.
Millions or billions of cubic
feet of CO two a year western
that underground but there may
be other mechanisms to do that
because of the directed.
Is to establish a mechanism for
the generation of credits
I just wanted to see how far
your intentions for with respect
to that issue.
So if you have any thoughts on
that I I certainly would
appreciate those.
Thank you madam chair
Representative Nibert and I
think broadly I I certainly
share.
The.
Excitement and commitment for
producers to participate and to
bring in new income
Representative new revenue
streams while continuing their
good work for the environment
Madam chair representative
Nibert.
I just don't want to get over my
skis and say something that's
dependent upon a rulemaking
process
To get down the level of
specificity that that will
depend upon that process Madam
chair representative Nibert this
will have to reduce emissions in
the transformation transporters
shins secretary but I think what
you alluded to really shows the
opportunity that even as we face
the catastrophic effects of
climate change
Then there are new opportunities
to fight this fight climate
change that are beneficial for
New Mexicans.
Madam chair and and
Representative in your opening
remarks.
A statement was made by you or
or maybe one of your experts
that are.
This this effort is to.
Maybe.
Insure that disproportionally
the statement was made that
These this carbon
disproportionately affects
communities.
Disproportionately impacted
communities bear the burden and.
I I found that to be a statement
because it seems to me that CO
two.
Disperses itself very quickly of
and that it does not state and.
The New Mexico concentrations in
any one community of so.
You may be are explained that in
further detail because are you
mad you and you could take
carbon dioxide readings
throughout the state and they
are going to be of.
There is some work I may not be
exact but they're going to be
fairly similar across the state.
So could you.
comment on that statement that
was made of.
For the opening of your remarks
sure thank you madam chair
Representative Nibert one in the
legislation we're looking to
find and focus some of the
benefits for rural and
disproportionately impacted
communities that is state the
credits that are generated by
electric utilities and the
proceeds that they get from
those credits those proceeds
will have to go back into a
lecture for cation in rural and
or disproportionately impacted
communities Madam chair of seven
average to your question why do
that
One Madam chair representative
Nighbor the concentration of
other emissions that are
associated with heavy
transportation fuels
Are shown to cause health
impacts and especially where the
use production and
transportation of those fuels is
in very close and heavy
concentration Madam chair
representative Nibert you know a
very.
In New Mexico the places
perhaps some in the south valley
that I'm aware of that are close
to very.
To to transportation fuels that
are Havel that are very carbon
intensive they're close to the
storage of this to the use of
this and those are some of the
disproportionate impacts that if
you live closer to where that
oil storage facility is where
that shipping facility is where
there are really big trucks
going up and down your rows are
very close proximity
that will the the your.
The air you breathe will be less
clean less safe than we take the
example of Albuquerque someone
there up in the northeast
heights who's not exposed to to
those on a daily basis and those
concentrations.
Madam chair representative
that Sir interesting remarks
because when I went to of the
University of New Mexico the
highest concentration of ozone
and the Albuquerque metro area
at that time was near Louisiana
and with all of that area are
concentrated the shopping here
at when rock which was much
different than that it is now
and Coronado shopping centers
and you have a lot of
a lot of vehicular traffic on
the lease and at all
as well as I forty yeah and so
that was always highlighted the
as I work through through our
school and actually did some
studies on that and that was
where the highest concentration
of those are I suspect of CO two
as well in the Albuquerque area
of so I understand you're you're
remarked that the closer you are
to the hello we can just areas
the the
smells the fumes the the.
Their constituents from that
exhaust is going to be at higher
concentrations but
you know I think a lot of it
depends on where those highways
go through the drive thru of.
Right now I'm disproportionately
impacted communities are going
to suffer the side effects of
the progress through and
disproportionately impacted
communities are there and so are
there I understand.
About the it was just.
Same to be a statement that the
I I didn't quite understand
because I I think CO two is is a
gas the rebel we disperses in
the atmosphere
our.
You know you're right thanks to
a high was you're going to have
maybe some concentrations that
are a little bit different than
next year
hundreds of yards away or
certainly a mile or two away but
but absent that the the carbon
dioxide levels of the state are
going to be.
Through some more.
Madam chair and representative
thank you for answering my
questions I'm really concerned
that this legislation.
Yes Hey.
It is just a government created
market players that really is
not going to do anything other
than raising prices low appeals
and and the people of New Mexico
are going to bear the increased
price thank you madam chair
thank you Representative I do
check the representative of the
more of them on the list at some
point madam chair thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you Representative Nibert
I will call on Representative
Ortez because I did not see
Representative the markets have
Representative Ortez and then I
will call on tomorrow.
Madam chair when it you are
calling him first thanks okay
Representative Zamora.
Thank you madam speaker.
Thank you members of the
committee and thank you
Representative for bringing this
bill forward.
Thanks six.
And the and talk about
agriculture and dairy.
And madam chair and
representative I wasn't quite
clear.
On on the on the dairy side and
and I think that the agriculture
professionals will be.
pretty much the same.
Warden and pretending to varies.
Explain to me.
Is it is a very.
Gonna be considered.
Somebody that.
The business that that creates
emissions.
Carbon emissions.
Madam chair representative of
what are at their.
Now first Madam chair
representative I'm a if a for
instance a dairy or Madam chair
representative Zamora state and
I an agricultural producer who
is growing
feedstocks some sort of crops
for that will be turned into
transportation fuels Madam chair
representative amada
This all if the carbon intensity
of those fuels is helping
Transportation secretary reach
the goals that are legislation
sets Madam chair representative
amada that and if the producer
wants to then essentially
they'll have a new market to
sell their product whether
that's the livestock waste
madam chair Sims amada whether
that's the
corn or other sort of bio fuel
feedstock Madam chair
representative Zamora.
If they choose to do that the
carbon intensity of their that
fuel will be calculated by by
the New Mexico environment
department but none of those
costs Madam chair representative
Zamora these are gonna be.
Lower carbon intensity fuels and
so they'll be there should be a
premium paid to the producer for
those feedstocks.
Whether that's the the.
Math the the dairy waste in one
simple or whether that's the the
corner of the
The other sort of feedstocks
that they might be growing.
Okay and and and madam chair and
and Representative.
Let's dissect that a little bit
I don't know how much their
experience you have and just
just so that I can understand
how kind of need to approach
this.
Can you tell me.
If you've been on a dairy or
understand them the mechanics of
their.
Madam chair says I'm on a I I
have that I've been on a dairy I
have not ever worked on a dairy
so
I understand a bit but not all
of the inner workings okay and
then madam chair and
representative so.
What and that that we have some.
When you're that produces
methane on the dairy.
But we also produce a little a
lot of milk which feeds the
world.
So.
There is don't.
I'm always.
And capture all their methane.
And they don't take they don't
necessarily take their corn and
produce deal with that.
Before they feed it to the cals.
So is it my understanding.
The state is going to go out and
check it's it's much methane
they believe they're producing.
And and then they're going to I
see fees and stuff all over this
bill Mattis Madam chair
representative as I want to
thank you very much for the
question there's nothing in this
bill that will mean that that
any producer is.
That that there are carbon
intensity or their operations or
what have you madam chair
representative what a that's not
part of this bill at all so I.
On if this bill passes.
You can tell your constituents
that no one will be going out
there to check on that carbon
intensity or anything like that
Madam chair representative on
water.
We if this bill passes and
producers want to.
Still the docks for lower carbon
fuels then this bill will help
create that opportunity right
now madam chair representative
amada.
They probably really don't the
the they don't have that
opportunity and less are going
to be shipped in and out of
state.
So madam chair representative
amada this will open up that
opportunity in state but Madam
chair representative and want to
be super there.
This will not mean.
Any.
You know anything additional
comes for our.
On top of existing air quality
water quality other sorts of
rules of the road that apply for
for Jerry's and producers this
doesn't add anything to that
Madam chair representative of
water.
And and madam chair
representative Lente when you
start answering the questions
like that it really complicates.
My thoughts because I think in
the arbitrate it's and then the
opposite of that.
The carbon emissions that are
being put out and for somebody
to have.
To be put no carbon emissions
are going to have to either have
some kind of carbon credit.
They're gonna have to be
reducing their emissions.
The to get some kind of a carbon
credit so that they can the run
tractors or have their.
Matt Madam chair representative
Amado that that is not part of
this bill.
At all Madam chair
representative Zamora it's not
part of this bill what so ever
there no carbon emissions limits
that are part of this madam
chair reps the some want to for
the producers of transportation
fuels.
There which would be a voluntary
option for agricultural
producers if they want to self
feed stocks to produce
transportation fuels then this
should open that market up Madam
chair representative amada
they're not going to have to
offset any of the operations
that happen on their farm or
their ranch.
There are no carbon emission
limits that are part of this so
so the situation you just
outlined just does not apply in
SB fourteen.
So Madam chair representative so
talking feedstocks they would
actually have to sell.
There.
Born.
To make.
A I'll fuel.
Madam chair representative so
sorry I interrupted go ahead
please to get eight to have a
carbon credit Madam chair
representative the more they
don't have to sell their
feedstock at all.
Madam chair representative and
what are they won't be required
under this bill to participate
one way or another.
If they want to keep doing
things the way that they are
doing them now that this bill
will not change that one one
little bit they don't have to.
By a different field five
different feeds any of that
Madam chair representative
someone.
They
this bill is just about reducing
the carbon intensity of
transportation feels and if
madam chair representative
Zamora New Mexicans want to be
part of that private sector to
help produce those lower carbon
intensity fuels.
I hope and we hope that this
will help protect provide that
opportunity but there's simply
no requirement that anybody do
anything different than what
they're doing now and there
won't be in this bill.
And and madam chair and
representative with all due
respect would you read on page
six section of.
Yep.
Madam right that down and then
break that down into layman's
terms for me so that.
So that I can understand them
better.
Madam chair.
Representative I'll go to Missy
Lee but to add additional
comment this is referring to the
generation of credits for
transportation fuels so madam
chair representative someone to.
If this includes all the areas
or some of the areas who may
generate credits for
transportation fuels but this
has to be a direct think madam
chair representative Zamora so
if it's a
A lower intensity carbon for
this only applies madam chair
let me explain it this way Madam
chair representative Zamora this
only applies for those who want
to.
Lower the carbon intensity of
transportation fuels so somebody
says Hey.
I want to.
Participate and I want to help
create a lower carbon intensity
fuel than section five applies
if somebody says.
Thanks but no thanks I want to
buy my field I don't want to do
anything different than what I'm
doing now section five does not
apply section five only applies
madam chair representative
Zamora for those who want to
participate in the reduction of
lower carbon intensity fuels.
It only applies to them okay and
and the and madam chair
representative so so let's break
that down into agricultural.
Dairy and forestry.
Yeah thank how would they.
Thank you madam chair thank you
madam chair representative amada
if that dairy wants to sell
their method they're they're
dairy waste their there are a.
They're a waste to produce a
lower carbon intensity fuel then
section I will apply to them if
they don't want to if they say I
don't want to participate it
does not apply Madam chair
representative amada if there's
an agricultural producers
somewhere who's growing a
feedstock whether that's corn
whether that's many of the bunch
other different sorts of
feedstocks in the state I want
to sell this to produce a lower
carbon intensity fuel then
section five applies if they
don't want to sell that they
don't want to produce a lower
carbon intensity fuel it doesn't
Madam chair representative
on Lara at in the forestry if
somebody says I can go create a
whole bunch the bio.
By
That's an by ways if if that
maybe at bio mass thank you very
much I want to go get a whole
bunch of biomass out there and
help produce a lower carbon
intensity fuel with that biomass
section five applies if they
don't want to use that biomass
to produce a lower carbon
intensity fuel than it does that
is simple as that.
Okay so so they say it say it
very says okay I want to
participate.
And I want to put a.
That changed over my hands and I
want to capture the methane and
I want to produce a field what's
the benefit for the.
Madam chair representative sure
Madam chair representative thank
you for that question we hope
the benefit is going to be that
they get a new income source.
For that product Madam chair
representative and that we're
also having a lower carbon
intensity fuel source so there's
fewer carbon emissions gone up
into the atmosphere that's their
budget.
And they don't receipt madam
chair and and Representative.
They would receive any carbon
credits or anything that's worth
anything and it kind of monies
are are white white why is this
bill brought forward forth I
mean these these things have
been tried on dairies and.
Thanks and the when it makes a
profit they they go ahead and do
it if if it doesn't seem to make
a profit or they they can't put
a cash flow sheet in front of
them they even start the project
will they don't do it so why why
is this bill be brought forth.
If we just let the market take
care.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative Zamora this is to
help expand that market that you
just described by insuring that
lowering carbon intensity fuels
with our that there's more of a
market for them Missy Lee do you
want to add anything to that.
Yes Madam chair representative
so what are.
The clean fuel standard in
California has generated the
credit market that has been
enticing to the very many dairy
farmers out there and has
generated more methane digestion
is in that state because it
didn't pencil out it was
voluntary nobody is required to
do this none of the dairies are
required to do this but they
thought they could make a profit
and they have I would also want
to note that there are there's
at least one company that would
like to come into New Mexico and
work with our dairy farmers to
generate credits and to self
help help sell those credits in
New Mexico so there is the
option to do that the dairy
farmer who puts in the digest
here for example and use.
That in order to create a file
requests would generate credits
that that dairy farmer could
then sell for a profit hopefully
profit.
To somebody else.
I tend to in Orland gas company
or a refinery that may not be
able to meet the emission
reductions required so that's
how this works the dairy farmer
can make some money they can
generate a lower carbon fuel.
So that credit to a refinery you
can then make their mandate
under B. fourteen but there's no
mandate for dairy farmers at
this time.
Thank you madam chair and and
thank you.
Center for for that answer so so
then.
Who holds the carbon credit the
piece of paper that says this is
worth X. amount of dollars madam
chair and.
And and the center.
Madam chair representative so
Laura the Jerry farmer would
hold that credit if they
generated that credit met the
requirements through third party
payers.
Then they would hope that it
will tell and and bank it until
they decide to sell it.
Okay you madam chair and and and
Representative Representative
and and center this that that
brings a little more clear.
So.
Anywhere in this bill.
Does somebody get punished for
emissions.
Madam chair representative so
lord if I may there's there are
admission requirements that the
providers those in import bland
or produce fuels in the state
have to me if they can't meet
those requirements there's a
paragraph in here regarding how
they would need to help those
requirements we're not issuing
notices of violation were not an
issue in ministry of compliance
orders we're making sure there
are credits available for them
to purchase in order to meet the
compliance obligations.
And madam chair.
Representative and and Sandra so
if a if a factory is they've
made it emitting.
These these a Harmon's.
How does this program and they
buy carbon credits.
We're not really stop in any
emissions so so how does how
does that help us.
Madam chair we are.
credits or have to be more
verifiable enforceable.
Permanent so their number
requirements on credit to make
sure they are real emission
reductions and the way to ensure
that is through this third party
certification and so yes we are
getting those emission
reductions as noted earlier CO
two is a global pollutant so
even if the project is in in
Clovis for example to help
facility an artesian meet their
requirements you're still
getting CO two emissions in New
Mexico.
Yes but the but the carbon
credits.
Allow somebody to emit carbons.
How how does that.
That doesn't really physically
stop.
The mission of the carbons.
Or slow down.
Madam chair.
Senator.
Madam chair representative.
Will be used for all the
projects and all those providers
that come under this program to
make sure that the offsets and
the commission reduction
requirements from those
providers at a that's alright
that will be our job in the
environment department through
the third party certification
for those credit.
So madam chair and
representative and and Sandra so
so if we do the math on that.
And we have.
The missions going on right now.
Say it's a thousand times.
And we'll just simplify it.
And then now.
If we if this bill passes.
And we take.
state dairy.
And the the slowdown emission.
And by capturing methane and put
it on the market making a
cleaner fuel for cars.
Those then get sold to the it
person to the factory amending.
Carbon.
So everything's a break even
there was no carbon reduction.
Madam chair representative
Zamora carbon reduction because
the carbon intensity has to
reduce from twenty eighteen
levels by twenty percent by
twenty thirty and so through
this rulemaking will establish
that steady slow in which those
reductions or for actually
occurring.
So yes there will be the
accounting will make sure that
we get those reductions over
time.
K. I just I just the.
Okay also okay studying that
I'll keep looking at it.
And the.
Thank you for your answers
I'm on page seven I see.
section online the number six I
see annual registration.
A providers at any person
generating credits.
Wondered why it has to be a
annual registration.
Madam chairman of the committee
once the program is up and
running we anticipate that this
will be an enterprise program
that will take care of itself
annual registration will make
sure that everybody in the
program whether they're mandated
to reduce as a provider for have
optional participation by
generating credits will be able
to cover the cost of this
program insure that those
emission reductions are are are
real verifiable and are
continuing to happen as as
promised.
Then on the on madam chair and
senator on.
And and if I may talk directly
to center madam chair six thank
present Representative
Representative Fiedler is on a
break.
And and that's not being made
to be disrespectful but so so
online the number seven there's
a the.
And of idea for what that fee
would be in and how much of.
That would cost a provider.
Madam chair representative so
Laura he can only cover the
reasonable cost of administering
and enforcing the program we
don't know what that will be at
this point we think we will need
approximately six staff members
to get this program up and
running and then to manage it.
After you know the ball making
so
you know that's.
Approximately seven hundred
thousand dollars to do that will
it will depend on how many
people come into the program
what the effort is to keep the
program running so you know
we'll see with that yes once we
go to the board and have an
assessment of the true cost once
we have a rule but at this point
that's what we're anticipating
is about six staff to to run the
program.
Okay and then up on page eight
there's a different I was.
Wonder what the definition
current and senator about
of the establish a fair market
for a credit are we going to be
looking at other states are we
going to be established in our
own market for that and then how
does that play out.
The on the investor part of it
if people want to.
By credits are they going to be
available on the order trade or
something like that where we
get.
Or people that want to money
into it would be able to buy
credits and and then settlement
of
Peter low on the marketer or how
does that work madam chair and
send.
Madam chair representative for
the we anticipate having a third
party manage the market it will
be a credit market for New
Mexico while California and
Oregon have their own credit
markets they want to maintain
their own credit markets it
wouldn't be a regional credit
market for western states at
least not at this point will be
in New Mexico credit market now
we will be selling or we can
have the opportunity seller
fuels School in other states the
credit market would be in our
current it would most likely be
run by third party and the board
will establish tools around the
market to make sure that it's a
fair market without a lot of
fluctuation and not easily came.
Okay.
Madam chair representative and
and Sandra thanks for your
answers and and I look forward
to.
See how this.
This keeps progressing and look
at it learn more about it thank
you madam chair and and thank
you Representative and center
for answering my questions.
Representative Ortez.
Thank you madam chair I do
believe that Representative
small had a little technical
issue but I'm gonna go ahead
