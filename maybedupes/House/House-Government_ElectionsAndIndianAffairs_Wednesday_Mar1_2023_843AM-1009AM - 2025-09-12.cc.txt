Carlos and under go ahead.
Thank you madam chair thank you
for your time as noted I am the
board chair of the New Mexico
board of licensure professionals
years professional surveyors
Representative Pettigrew did
excellent job kind of outlining
what the changes are intended to
do I just wanted to note as well
for any questions come up that
and several of the changes that
we're proposing are based on
feedback from I guess the
broader constituents not just
licensees but those are
unlicensed and their interest in
availability of professionals to
do this work so I I kind of feel
like we really did want to
address the public's need for
engineers and surveyors with
these changes.
And to move things along as as
Mr pedigree said in a very
expeditious way for licensure to
thank you.
Well they just go ahead.
Madam chair members of the

Mexico board of engineers and

that you may have.
Stay on the webcast for comments
in opposition to the bill.
Seeing none are there any
comments in the audience and
opposition to the bill seeing
none committee members.
Okayed Representative Chasey to
pass.
Ask one question.
Madam vice chair.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative can you clarify
on page twenty one to twenty two
this section is about
reciprocity with out of state
licenses.
And what will accept in New
Mexico.
So page twenty one starting the.
That might be licensed the
currently licensed as a
professional survey or in other
states.
Where do you see.
Going on to page twenty two it
says provided that and there's a
the.
And then there section to.
Which seeing the same thing if
they are licensed in another
state.
Provided that.
And there's a B. C. and D..
Representative two parts of the
question why do we have to pass
to reciprocity incentives
striking the first a and B. and
putting in this new.
Twenty two key.
Pathway number one is my first
question and the second is just
Line seventeen they've been
actively license for fifteen
years.
Why fifteen years
and what of other reciprocity
statutes we have more than five.
So much by fifteen what does
that mean to engineers.
Thanks madam chair madam chair
vice chair
Two avenues specifically if you.
Taking the exam and you know
that New Mexico low income
levels reciprocity was one way
to another one is allow you and
maybe you haven't graduated from
twelve insurance pool a crude
school but you have the
experience pass the examine
other one and you successfully
go on a term without an ethics
violation okay then you can come
in on a comedy basically and
it's kind of streamlines and
that's part of the
administrative pieces that kind
of makes Mexico little bit
quicker with that I will turn it
over to to the expert witnesses
want to add something to the.
Madam chair Representative
Figueroa going on
This path start off this path is
an expedited path so the first
section is for all licensees who
don't fit the expedited path
from our expedited pathways
asking someone to be license
fifteen years because at that
point they're showing that they
haven't had any disciplinary
action and that their could
figure they do all these
qualifications nor verification
their suspensions of their
license I'm and it is just
streamlined process these are
considered expedited we just
need a verification from the
state that shows that there
fifteen years and then the would
be able to get off right here
and pandemic house
Representative pedigree stated.
It will allow them.
Come in faster.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative stuff if I
understood correctly pathway
number one that starts on page
twenty one is for folks who have
the dignity and the test and the
licenses or state and we number
two is proposed to ma'am and I
had the degree but have the
license and the experience in
another state and my
understanding it correctly
Representative your honor
correct and as well it is a
streamlined process so that
someone who does have the degree
of experience and the exams
everything can still apply
through the just passed process
this is a faster process if you
go through the first process you
will have to submit transcripts
references
verifications this one is just a
verification showing that you
meet the qualifications.
In the Essex okay.
Thank you.
Sponsor the expert witnesses so
pathway to could be someone who
has that three but they don't
want the rigmarole.
Want to do it slide.
Madam chair for.
It's my life since there's
important there's a package you
have to.
For every piece of my experience
over my.
Almost four years now I would
have to fill out my professional
experience records show how many
years of that in that time frame
had had a
The engineer in charge what
we're I had responsible charge
for the role and then I would
have to give a
get a reference for that record
as well of an engineer and so
when we get a license
Yeah my dad used to tell me that
for me at the time of the
supporters still remained for
years so you can take the test
quicker now such as four years
of experience not one year of
experience for funds and so that
you fill out that form well for
me that form side time I'm done
with my experience record on
projects that I've worked on
over forty years but then half
an inch you know have the staff
and this one Palau's process
we're parity have another state
to state they've proven the
staff from.
They're you know they're not in
their license revoked as
explanations and Justice
streamlined process were an
engineer say we have another
catastrophe in the state on for
far for anything like that
somebody can come in uses
process.
And be able to get from the
forget their kids are requests
from the board quicker.
Thank you madam chair
representative the only other
question was something suggested
and the fiscal.
To the sunset dates line up in
this bill and the bill we passed
the house.
Yes madam chair and as vice
chair the do ana okay Zacks.
Rating so we have a motion for
to pass presented Chasey second

Thank you committee.
Thank you.
The staff here is yes we do.

Okay Representative.
Good morning madam chair.
Maybe
one.
Of course you may.
Hospital for four zero.
Which is.
Distribution.
Of course.
The states.
For
more to municipalities.
Portion rules for.
The consequences of health six.
Communities southeast New
Mexico.
In that.
The change from board
destination.
Source.
To the unique nature of the
services that are provided to
the oil and gas industry in
southeast Mexico left us short
changed courses.
Representative form.
This legislation.
Was only related to selfish
Mexico.
We attempted to put together a.
Process would allow all.
Of the cities and counties in
the state.
For all the of full screen if.
Senator small portion revenues
distributed out to counties and
cities and refer to produce more
expert witness on call for
insulated for six tax increase.
So
much that other than to and
A couple days ago we have
Senator Curran's you guys are
here she mentioned that there
are some fixes that were
circulating of this is one of
those fixes we came up with
this.
Other that'll stand for
questions as we go through the
process thank you.
Let's go to the audience.
Do we have the members in the
audience who are in support of
the bills.
To express themselves
any opposition to that.
Sir.
Jurors a committee of Bill
Jordan with New Mexico voices
for children.
We respectfully at two of those
this legislation I think as you
can see from the many pages in
the FY are from both the tax
department of the LFC they have
major issues of the policy
itself and with the formula.
Words to live on Mars and
problematic to describe the
proposal.
Our opposition really stemmed
from the fact that this is a
three hundred million dollar hit
to the general fund and it's and
it's not one that helps you to
our families or is it simply a
transfer of funds from state to
local governments those of you
who've been around a while no
one night here we created with
the hold harmless districts.
The local governments we come
back here here justice does hold
harmless provisions and really
created kind of a nightmare for
both the state and local
governments and a lot of hard
feelings just because it hasn't
worked and I think this is just
one more of those attention it's
something with the formula that
is just not.
We're not going to be.
while.
Creating a three hundred billion
dollars in the general fund they
have a whole is here but it will
be in future years.
I we're reminded committee that
some of the legislature is also
considering.
Will will cost local governments
another eighty million dollars
if that passes we're going to
see even more pressure to come
back
and make these.
Fixes and transfer.
The state to the walls with
those kinds of complex revenue
ships I I just think we're
creating a.
Thank you thank you.
do we have the.
More comments from the audience
in opposition to the bill.
CNN.
Webcast.
Do we have any comments in
support.
Yes in opposition.
Committee members
Representative.
Chair and.
Yeah.
As the Representative Scott and
TJ.
What I would do is kind of the
explained or new members so we
pass what's called destination
taxi.
So your business is located what
state in Albuquerque.
Look at Bernalillo county.
There are seventeen different
fifteen to seventeen different
tax locations within formally
account.
So rather than using the
location of your business if you
went down to the village of rand
Cheetos are of of ranches there
that's one tax if you went over
by
Coronado shopping's or
out when rocked that's another
tax rate so what you're doing I
have an individual that's going
to come and fix the heater my
house he's now got a similar
structured for the tax rate.
And during that time he's
actually charging.
For that work is that kind of
how it is.
Sure refuse.
Yeah we read.
We created a nightmare and madam
chair when you're ready for a
motion on the.
Right.
If.
I think
Particular.
No one was.
Madam this on to the tax yeah I
think you need to go the tax so
I've made no record
recommendations we.
Passes tax thank you madam chair
that we have a motion on the
table for
Thank you passed with no
recommendation and the second by
Representative.
Do we have any opposition.
This.
Well sure we were only now.
Representative on in order.
No.
Representative block.
Yes Representative Chasey.
Representative Hochman Vigil.
Representative little.
No.
Representative Rehm yes.
Representative Zamora yes.
But sure Figueroa no.
Madam chair Johnson.
Why are we moving again I know
the PRC from the building across
the street.
Downtown Santa Fe no supposed to
be a permanent fix or somewhere
you guys moving now with madam
chair.
So madam chair Representative
lock we are in the Poconos
downtown the challenge of the
Boca building is that we have a
fox mentally.
Want to make sure I get
forty.
That building and we have she
says please provide building.
and other challenges the poking
building parking
we don't have sufficient parking
to cover all the way there are
some of the building so we do
have refer care sticker
validations at the central
office to take care of that do
need to come into the building
obviously.
The challenge.
Having more people into the
building that space some place.
The majority of the employees
are hybrid schedules and so we
have to rotate out parking also.
Which can be challenging the
city parking garages you can
only sign to be able to one
access card.
Also have to be self parking
lots in order to accommodate
those.
Okay thank you madam chair thank
you Representative experts.
So.
I get that I do get that.
You need more space.
So right now is this are we
gonna be moving to the public
building are we going to be
renting out your filled in with
this bill madam chair.
Madam chair representative block
we've built house TST purchased
building
for the use of various.
So it will be if the state.
Thank you madam chair.
Representative so then this will
be our building once we procure
at and then we want to rant
Committee buddy of the hours
correct this Madam Madam chair
representative lot that's my
understanding right now we are
seeing here is one of the State
Building here see.
Basically has fifty purchasing.
Hi the building.
Thank you Representative.
Okay Representative Zamora madam
chair and and presenters is it
going to be remodeled efforts
purchasers this all right to
give.
Chair representative is what I
believe that in the probably
requires the.
Chairman and.
Senator huh how much that is a.
it chair representative Martha
and it it depends on what what
all improvements are made to the
building
so it will various of the right
now there's two point five
million dollars for the purchase
of the building it's been priced
at two point two million dollars
so there's some money included
in their ancestors languages
including for purchase at the
facility.
Thank you madam chair and
prisoners Paul.
Representative.
Thank you madam chair.
Representative stand
representative and presenters I
had some questions about the
current location.
And that
is that is that properties being
rented.
Madam chair representative that
we have a lease agreement.
So that.
Well my father says.
Thank you for that.
Just one more question so I see
here is currently that is case
number Tyerman court building.
Right now Madam chair
representative madam chair
representative block the
educational retirement board.
So it is one of the few
facilities that is not state
owned or owned by the General
Services Department facilities
management division it was
purchased with education
chairman for funds it's not held
as part of the trust that it is
an asset ciation.
Okay thank you madam chair
Senator so we're finding from
representative provided from
Madam chair representative
locked.
The state will be purchasing it
from the education retirement
board and proceeds of that will
be used to offset the
construction of the facility
that we are right.
Here in the next couple months.
Thank you madam chair.
Do have.
Your roof.
Chasey in the second by
Representative on your new.
Do we have any opposition to
this.
Please take for Representative
long in order to yes
Representative o'clock.
Representative Chasey yes.
In part in the yes.
Representative live yes
Representative ring yes.
Representative Zamora yes.
Budget Figueroa yes but if.
Right.
Yes.
Senator videos.
this anybody want to prove to a
bill.
There is no.
This for house bill four six
nine.
I'll be here all right.
The.
K. spoke.
This is okay from.
If you could be the.
All.
The
purpose.
Chair we're ready to.
With the house bill four sixty.
And I think that the the
temporary just.
Good morning madam chair
committee thank you for this
opportunity presents you
It was of course and the couple
years ago and we got them of our
case studies are salaried
valuations.
we realize that the statutes
that sort of dictate the
district attorney's probably has
been amended in over thirty
years and with welding changes
come throughout whether it's a
new position of course.
I need to do we realize that for
statutes need to be changed so.
As you can see from the changes
there's not too many changes
that were made
well for us now it's this to
survive just and bring this back
up to the current.
The status of our world.
so.
I'm not sure what you want to
hear or see but I think it's
probably easiest if I just sent
the request so thank you all
right let's go to the audience
do we have supported.
Good morning mentions Committee
markers with original district
attorney and president.
Association to really just echo
DHS rose hello just we're just
trying.
More a statute that says we just
for.
Thank you thank you for the
comments seeing them go to the
White House.
New members can.
Yeah.
Income is issues.
All right Representative Chasey.
Thank you madam chair thanks
this year.
So right now how does that work.
With which part I'm sorry
salaries how do you need a
straight to the LFC.
Chair representative to see that
yes currently is set to the
appropriations act and as the
elected judges so what we're not
changing anything more we're
just taking out the old language
that used to sort of separate
the two
many many years ago they used to
Representative
as I jokingly for many years
heard about the great lesson for
you all.
The greater and lesser dust.
so there was a metro that was a
different rate than the rules
the group got together many
years ago and said this is not
right you know yes the
Bernalillo may have more work
they also have more people to
help.
And so several several years ago
we just talked to.
On the appropriations act as it
is and just set make us all so
they did that and sort of thing
Cherry that way for many years
now it's still just on through
the appropriations act just like
the judges separate and.
madam chair and Representative
right.
With this change that that would
change would still go through
this appropriation that.
Madam chair representative yes
it's it's I think up.
On page.
On page two Live Aid resistant
we still left in the we take out
that for fiscal year two
thousand one sort of shows L.
long ago this was an address and
we did leave in the languages
just as the annual salary for
distribution that was by the
legislature in the probation.
So madam chair.
I would say Representative
Freeman because he said it was
more of Representative is one
translate.
But you can.
Right.
Representative right
You know you said has been
revised in thirty years and I'm
I would just just thinking about
a bill I tried to revise Senator
Michaels and Justin I tried to
revise it had the oil and gas
act had changed at all since
nineteen thirty five.
And I'm not quite sure it has
since then Senator Sanchez and I
weren't successful at that time
so there are a lot of of these
antiquities here
madam chair and representative.
The first teaching job was in
California and I know I know
education funding is district by
district in the states have do
it all differently but those
rural areas got paid.
To go there.
No from discussing things and
I'm not suggesting that that
statute.
Certainly I am so that includes.
We hear from the public defender
and the district attorney's
about trying to get the added
staffed in rural areas Mr Wade
would probably agree with that.
This is really hard on the dust
from the rural areas to.
To get get your office is fully
staffed Madam chair
representative that is correct
we have a very large gestures
with the public defender's
office.
A.
And I trust some of our metro
area turns to these rural
Senator I apologize for going to
the audience without checking
with you really sorry
so I I don't.
I guess maybe I just want to
hear how this improves things
for you and we have tried to do
loan forgiveness for I turned to
St public service which public
defender and district attorney
following those categories and
I'm I'm just wondering madam
chair
Representative remained Mr
Tetreault if this could help in
any way or this is just
something that needs to happen.
Madam chair representative this
really address that there are
last year we
through appropriations there
wasn't establishment of some
rural pay like at the image for
you mentioned and those bills
are.
During this session that are
circulating that both the sis
the.
Trying to more recruitment and
retention so this really would
it but there are other things.
All.
So madam chair and
Representative
re Mr tundra.
Are we.
Making changes to the act now
that.
Would have to be changed or
revised.
Because we're putting numbers in
statute.
You know sometimes we put we put
a figure in statute that we have
to contact ten years later its
way on.
But are you this is something
that.
Probably before we revision
regularly.
manager Representative Chasey.
I think we see every year we
come back and realize that we
missed something somewhere but
we.
Our reserves we.
I would say over how it's being
it's been like this that the a
salaried.
Shelby.
said but by the appropriations
act there's been times where we
discussed and debated with the
LFC on how maybe the sometimes
forget you know as we say we're
the the fourteen for guided.
So
in theory with our number in
there is always gonna be every
year up to House Bill to so I
don't see why you have to come
back and change.
Thank you very much madam chair
I just I I just
we can eventually figure out how
to.
Get the public service part of
the legal profession
adequately funded and staffed
Cleveland thank you.
Committee members.
This has.
He has a motion for to pass
Representative Zamora second by
Representative block do we have
any opposition to this motion C.
M. please show off.
As.
Representative.
Imaginary very.
Invisible Representative.
This.
The answer for me thank you very
much madam chair thank.
Time Senator want to the right.
Okay.
Six years here.
Good morning morning
Representative.
Representative.
I guess it's just me this
morning I was hoping to get some
of our.
Contact the veterans office but
that they were able to join us
but.
Would you have in front of you
madam chair and representative
his house going Representative.
And what this is.
Article eight section five of
the constitution in New Mexico
increase a property tax
exemption for honorably
discharged members of the armed
forces and the windows.
And basically what we're
proposing here.
Is that.
Currently he of the tax
exemption is that four thousand
dollars and we are just
proposing that go up to five
thousand dollars and I just need
to say this because it's really
important
Representative Alcon also has
the the similar bills his his
goes from four thousand dollars
to ten thousand dollars and
That particular bill was and
it's also his also based on
information.
If there's a.
so.
Gail Harris for how that would
go up with inflation over time
this is really just laughed and
I the reason I bring that up is
because is because his was.
Working to get to the floor and
honestly you know you're kind of
working together
and I and I would be remiss if I
didn't tell you you know
honestly I if his doesn't go
through this is sort of a back
up plan.
In case it doesn't go through
because I think that it's
important that better and so do
have some sort of increase in
our property tax exemption.
so I'm not sure meeting.
I want to be on you know up
front and honest with you guys.
What we're doing
we're we're track trying to work
together what we what I
basically told him is it his
goes through then I would try
this
his doesn't go through then we
try to work on this together so
that kind of our strategy.
and.
Hopefully one of these will go
through.
And I have numbers if you need
to know how many people will be
affected by this thank you have
is there have been forty two
thousand veterans and if it is
estimated that sixty eight
percent veterans of nineteen
ninety six five hundred sixty
qualify for this benefit so I
thought it's important to bring
that information to you.
And that is my my testimony for
this.
One forty two yes.
John Martin.
It was reported two thousand
yes.
But but how many are.
Sixty percent of the one point
yeah.
Our.
eligible with.
Of.
Let's go to the audience.
Do we have comments of
Representative before you that
madam chair I almost forgot
sorry I ment Committee and
generally to bills and I'm
trying to do the best they can
I also have a proposed
amendments and let me remind.
and basically with the amendment
does is on.
Two point eight.
Sort.
Which year okay so you the state
is that two to five number.
Yes it is point two two five
seven six nine point one okay.
Your amendment for discussion.

Right now we can we go to the
audience for public comment.
Representative.
In.
I don't have any with with the.
Madam chair do we have any place
my name is Martin cells are that
trend of fusion record
I'd benefit from this bill right
now but as wishin and we'll talk
about this later on in a
different building I'll be
speaking on it helps a lot of
veterans who we come as low if
there is any security or their
veteran benefits.
It will help them even if it's
only a hundred dollars a year it
could be the difference between
a medication and other things.
Thank you any any further
comments in support of the bill
seeing them let's go to the
webcast John Dickerson go ahead.
Madam chair members the
committee John Dickerson was of
veterans and military families
caucus and we support this bill
because it would raise the
exemption from four thousand
dollars to five thousand dollars
this is the most popular state
benefit available to our hundred
forty two thousand all veterans
according to the New Mexico
department of Veterans Services.
The statute has not been updated
since two thousand six and we've
had a steep rise in home values
since then of this benefit is
been proven in states across the
country to increase the rate of
veteran homeownership and we
would just recommend that you do
pass this bill thank you very
much.
All right let's stay on the
webcast or comments.
I don't see anyone else knew.
Opposition of the bill of
audience in opposition to the
bill seeing that committee
members.
Representative Zamora.
Casey thank you madam chair
thank you present.
So so you stated on porting to
qualify Sixtyeight percent.
There's a hundred forty two
thousand.
Sixtyeight percent with Paul I
how many of users.
I don't have that information in
front of me right now of
the and I on my.
Thank you sorry thank you madam
chair some of our community
Representative Chasey thank you
madam chair and thank you
Representative our goal is
really appreciate it I was.
Representative all clones am I
don't know the number of it and
I appreciate appreciate you
letting us know working
together.
Representative nor do we giving
me the answer.
I just and I and I don't know
what to this committee admitted
maybe I miss the hearing because
I was gone for a week.
And do these things.
Not a.
Okay all classes so it is that
that Madam chair representative
Greg off that the tax committee
would.
What were the two of them
together that is or is Madam
chair representative what we're
and I'm being totally honest
with Frank
we're kind of playing here in
his bill does not go through
that we're hoping that this bill
is still on the table I see and
that you know because he is
asking for significant increases
asking for five of the thousand
dollars and I'm only asking for
a thousand and this actually and
I I didn't say this earlier
managers very straight but this
would actually go to the voters
so the.
I and this was different.
Because his is tied to the rate
of inflation.
And the so every year the
veterans
decides to five thousand dollars
increase in getting sealed every
year whatever that inflation
very yes that's what they would
be getting some thank you madam
chair thank you Representative
because I thank the members of
this committee heard me say this
before if we can.
The staff so that we don't have
to read this in ten years to
change the numbers that's a good
approach so this is through I
would urge you to and engineers
to put the CPI indexing is that.
Would have to the voters again
twenty years or ten years or
fifteen years
Eighty years.
Earlier I don't have and
representative Chasey we are
definitely thank you okay the
same thank you nations that that
by I'd rather have come from you
thank you very much chair I
don't have questions
Representative thank you madam
chair representative for this
bill I appreciate it no I I'm
actually co sponsor
representative of outcomes
resolution and I think that the
inflation index is definitely
where we want to be going so I
appreciate Representative TC's
comment about that and I look
forward to any amendments that
would.
Thank you madam chair
representative yes and share
Representative if his bill goes
through and I would withdrawals.
So just to be clear up to the
committee that and that's why I
said we're sort of a double CD
here
And what else I guess that's
without.
Thank you for trying to be
honest about it.
Representative with yes thank
you madam chair that to the past
please.
And as amended thank you.
Have a motion for to pass by
Representative little and the
second do we have any opposition
to this motion.
Saying that these show all
present the privative.
It is coming to pass on house
joint resolution tennis and then
thank you madam chair thank you
Representative.
And now we're ready for those
firms should be left.
Thank you madam chair
representative.
So.
This bill
before I get started I'd like
to.
This is captain Martin Phillis
owner and he is with the
Albuquerque firefighters.
Thank you.
I have is yes.
Firefighters and rescue and.
You right from the.
area and madam chair and
committee members personally
thank you for the opportunity to
present this.
As well this is.
One right reintroduced like yes
I also want to introduce
If you.
Higher rates of us have a New
Mexico professional firefighters
association thank you.
So
I I just want to tell you that
what we're proposing here today
is in this particular bill is we
are amending part eight section
five of the constitution of New
Mexico provides a property tax
exemption for certified full
time state and local
firefighters and of basically
this is a similar bill to what
Of the one HA are standing order
acceptance is required.
Only and this is for active duty
firefighters
and basically what we are
proposing here is we are
proposing an increase from fort
that.
Two five thousand dollars
similar to what we saw in the
previous bill would also.
on the ballot for.
in the need to say that
basically.
A lot of people.
But firefighters do not receive
social security and I don't know
if people are aware of that.
Act but my mother was married to
a firefighter for thirty years
and when my father died she is.
It was really an eye opener for
the need for personal because I
do that I didn't realize that
and then when I came to start
working with firefighters S. C.
planner and I work very closely
with them because we did a lot
of building programs and that
sort
of that I came to find later on
the most of don't receive a
federal state social security
and so with a receipt and
analyst captain sellers or talk
about this a little bit but.
You know.
Retired they have to go look for
other jobs or end up staying on
longer because of their bills
and maybe a half four to not to
not retire or to or rather to
retire I guess because the the
just for facing a situation of
finding a job or and and and
most of them as you know are
dealing with
and that's why we have a package
just so you know we're working
on firefighters package and
we're working on incentives to
keep firefighters you might just
see the news last night we also
have a couple of other bills
that the of may not come to this
committee
for incentives to to attract
more fighters but also to help
sustain firefighters and so I'm
gonna let caption the cells are
speak a little bit because most
of them are dealing with you
know
jobs that are.
Beyond anything that we deal
with on a day to day basis and
our regular jobs especially when
they're life threatening
and so I'm captain cells thank
you Representative
Madam chair and representatives
by as the Representative I'm
Kevin sizer about the fire
rescue.
Member of the international
association of firefighters and
Representative firefighters
around the state and country
Within all of the departments in
New Mexico and elsewhere were
facing issues with recruitment
and retention.
So we're we're trying to create
something that either keep our
talented people here in New
Mexico.
For bringing others from around
the country here in New Mexico
to help fill the void currently
right now for the fire rescue
your mandated that are budgeted
for seven hundred sixty one
firefighters and we at seven
hundred well.
We had forty five of getting we
had a hundred applied we have
forty five getting million
twenty nine left in our academy.
So that seems not like a lot but
we look at the other department
Lynsey County for example their
fire department has twenty four
firefighters.
If they lose three of on their
percentage and coverage goes
down we're looking at ways to
help that the statewide this is
not a big city Albuquerque Santa
Fe Los crucis issues the
statewide issue where we need
to.
Sentence to bring people here
and the representative has
created very other recruitment
type rules including healthcare
and other things to help working
conditions better PTS built up
your support we can help then
the the person that are working
extra hours and things to help
cover and make sure this is the
New Mexico receive the health
and safety they need within
their communities are covered
and protected
there's no there's money tied to
it but it's based within the
agency polity and and the tax
rate on the value of the homes
so when I started the fire
department
twenty three years ago I was
making six dollars an hour so
our firefighters right now
making fifteen dollars an hour
my son the sixteen make sixteen
fifty working every.
Get social security when he's
done he's getting credit for
that we don't receive that.
The the percentage over this
point the percentage of
A and the tax rate that five
thousand dollars would bring
it's a few hundred dollars that
you can be the difference.
For medications as I stated
earlier the veterans increase on
their medications for food or
even having their children the
ability to play a sport.
So every little bit helps and by
combining all the packages with
healthcare PTSD peer support
And we're approving funding
incentives to just bring Google
here help get and people here
in.
each departments different pays
different throughout the state
but on average we're about fifty
percent lower than comparable
states around the country when
we look at el Paso Colorado
springs and places like that
what the pay is lost lose fire
right now with minimum wage
changes those firefighters look
at twelve fifty an hour so that
will take their right up but
right now they're under that
right
we work a different schedule
fifty six hours so we were fifty
six hours a week so our number
is lower on certain parts but
our recruits coming in even on
the high end that paramedics are
around seventeen dollars an hour
but then the rate will drop down
to fifteen once they go on R.
fifty six hour work week.
And we're urging for support on
this has an effective to get
people here and help them.
There's no allocations as far as
money for us just to make a
change and that change is to
help bring more public safety
officers into New Mexico.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Let's be ready for questions go
to support as there anyone in
rural here in support
resolution eleven.
Is there anyone in the room in
opposition.
I see none the webcast is
currently all staff of just that
they wanted to.
Okay.
This is saying that committee
Representative right.
Yeah Madam chair of the
committee members of it's called
the tax exempt so it is an iris
deals the in the seventies they
put in and what they decided was
that first responders so I'm one
of all.
Had such a good retirement but
what we're gonna do is we're
gonna take your social security
so when I went in to retire or
to get social security you would
get X. amount but because you
were first respond or we're only
going to give you thirty to
forty percent of your
contribution so if you'd never
worked those twenty years you
would have got more than
doubles.
Of what you're gonna see.
So you receive about thirty to
forty percent but it's safe to
go to the IRS you do windfall
tax exemption that's what it is.
Not turn this Representative
read for clarification yes we do
get more you may if you have
never.
Worked as a firefighter but you
were in the same amount of money
doing something else okay is
that what you have no madam
chair in Representative Chasey
if you hadn't worked for twenty
years at all at all you would
receive acts but you works
better of social security of
social security.
But because you work that twenty
years and law enforcement or for
fire you're now going to receive
thirty to forty percent.
Go for what you should have
received.
Madam chair representative right
is that considered like.
Social security saying why you
decided to do this.
This is that what they're.
Representative right is not
either had.
my my husband's oldest daughter
was a teacher in California and
they have such a good retirement
plan thank you to all get their
full social security when they
retire but I don't I don't think
it ends up in period.
Like this sounds like it to us
although it's kind of a shock to
me to find that she doesn't get
calls here.
big but that's an agreement
really with that you
Representative
having been a teacher in
California yes that is because
the pensions cover for law
enforcement providers the
assumption is the state has a
pension that takes care of them
their forces security isn't
needed and their social security
is non existent or reduced and
madam chair that they're not
paying into social security
either correct.
Thank god.
Thank you and did you have a
questions Representative
from the Air Force yes madam
chair and
Representative so I went to a
let's see so I went to the
Council state governments
meeting and what the showed the
other demographer there when
they showed is what you should
have insured population should
look like a Christmas tree
perfect Christmas tree with the
oldest on the top of the Ms on
the bottom of the show that.
We adults did not have enough
children.
And I remember it's it's one
point seven that we have but I
think we to sustain the
population we need to have two
point four two point seven.
So your Christmas tree starts
going in at the bottom and the
demographer said this is really
interessierte the kids coming up
today.
We'll take the jobs of people
who have college degrees they
won't need a college degree and
they're going to dictate what
their salary is.
Then last year I went to us.
National Council legislators and
their they did a study all
across the U. S. city county
state federal he said what
percentage of jobs are being
filled.
And it was thirty to forty
percent all across the country.
Because we don't have enough
kids and that's why I've
introduced return to work for
all of their employees.
As always tabled every year.
And that's how you're gonna
solve our problem.
We're gonna have to have some of
the guys come back to work.
Anyway that's my speech among
them.
Representative circling back to
the building.
Representative.
So is my understanding that they
would lose this benefit once
they're no longer an active duty
I share and Representative law
that is correct.
Okay I just need to say this
madam chair I the this while I'm
proposing this for firefighters
this is true a lot of this is
true for police as well as I say
that because I talked to
Representative we even he and I
have talked a lot about your
hand yet firefighters and police
to.
Sign up into and we talked about
the return to work and and I was
the president of the Herald in
return to work.
happened back in two thousand
and.
LSA held I am back in two
thousand eight two thousand nine
two thousand ten and there were
there were a lot of questions I
mean it did solve some of those
issues but at the same time what
happened was it was intended
only for public safety and they
opened it up to everybody and
then there started being a lot
of abuses with that return to
work issue so I am sorry I have
to say that because I was.
And I think it's important to
know that you know there's a
real need to find ways to
incentives to pay for
firefighters and recruit of and
our police officers thank you.
Block so they would not cases
after they retire.
Okay Madam chair representative
so since there's no social
security here little social
security.
Madam chair I just maybe we want
to extend that throughout
retirement.
Chair to any comments on that.
If so the Madam chair
representative.
So currently
After the pair of men with them
this week total numbers right
now paying into municipal fire
we have about.
Two thousand four hundred ninety
four and then retirees we have
been useful fire two thousand
would be in effect currently
right now about five thousand we
don't have an FIR showing that
specific.
but we look at fiscal impact
according to tax rate stop
working and county assessors the
average New Mexico property tax
is eight hundred eighty dollars
per year.
So most County The New Mexico
tax the rate of high speed
Bernalillo at zero point eight
one percent of the median home
value and Harding County being
the lowest the tax there
property taxes zero point three
six percent so it would come up
to a few hundred dollars per
year at the most for that which
seems like a lot considering
what it costs to get on the
ballot but if there's things
built into it so once it's on
there it's a continuing benefit
to them it will help bring and
keep people in New Mexico and I
believe that I think his
question was for people to they
retire we want to continue this.
Yes.
It would it would incentivize it
to to join in the first place
knowing that you have that
ability later on and those just
are the numbers currently right
now would affect about twenty or
forty seven hundred people in
New Mexico as opposed to the
backroom deal which was quite a
few hundred thousand are not
actually was a hundred.
Okay thank you madam chair
representative so then my other
question is how many folks are
part time currently not like
volunteer at all but part time
firefighters do we have any
faster.
Madam chair representative for
the combination departments and
programs and other bills that
we're presenting our help to
bring
more paid fire fighters on board
and help those municipalities
with that.
the combination that total of
combination the numbers are
tracked specifically.
If they get have time as a
volunteer part time is full so I
I don't have those numbers but
there are departments within New
Mexico like that.
Thank you madam chair that's all
thank you Representative clock
Representative Rehm other
questions madam chair and
of Representative I can't
remember on the.
Thinking about this so
Let's take your last bill in
your case so can you get head of
household of veteran and then if
you will now firefighters can
you get each one of those or do
you only get one I can't
remember honor tax bill could
play multiple sports
Representative I I believe that
you can you can apply for all
okay.
Madam chair representative
representatives you do hi I have
a tax bills as I live I get the
veterans and House head of
household right now in there too
so.
In each municipality would be
responsible than that County
the part to apply so that's why
the previous numbers talk about
your available account you're
receiving it's a matter of
applying for it if you need that
income or if you even on
property and Jordy of our
firefighters and our department
rent.
Representative.
That's
right Representative no thank
you madam chair making motion to
pass.
We have a motion for do passed
from representative on your new.
And we have a second
Representative Hochman Vigil yes
we have a question
Representative Chasey I thank
you madam chair and
representative
I just noticed on FIR that says
it conflicts with
The house street missiles to
six.
It says.
Conflicts with HDR six and ten
year period intended we were
talking about supporting six so
I'm sure it's going to tax but I
do I do with that that it's a
little bit of a concern.
And it seems to me that perhaps
those.
I don't suggest that we try to
address right this moment but I
think we're madam chair and and
Representative Chasey I think
we're fully aware and as I
mentioned we are going to be
following Representative Alcon
still very.
Thank you madam chair.
Thank you Representative on way
to good couple of questions
would you like Representative
little thank you securities
She madam chair thanks Jeff
and representative that this is
an entirely for firefighters.
Is this.
Had any thought been given to
including other first
responders.
Are we not as it's a two part
question because it's a if you
are we have a mental illness
retained in this one
Representative little as I
mentioned earlier I am working
on a package of bills for
firefighters and we did talk
about the other first responders
but at this point we wanted to
focus since we have that package
for
we have for example we have some
other bills one that came up
yesterday will be giving five
thousand dollars to new recruits
for firefighters and if they
sign up and the state three
years and they keep the five
thousand dollars if they leave
then they have to pay it back
and so we creative claims we're
creating a funds rather a
similar to what the police have
to police already have that fund
in place so we're trying to the
make some of the things that are
already in place and of
hopefully attract more
firefighters to
the state of New Mexico because
we there really is a shortage.
I
I'd like to add to that
madam chair Representative.
Required trying free parity that
something's that is needed on
the law enforcement and other of
public safety side they have for
example house bill two seven has
a five thousand dollar bonus
over certain time so we're just
trying to create that parity
along with.
They had started their funds
before us we're trying to play
catch up and right now it's hard
to amend ADRs include them if
they are we have something on
the books to get in there so
this is a way for us to create
another Avenue as
representatives of the regular
set package for in retention
for.
First responders have a missed
last year in the initial funding
to.
Thank you thank you madam chair
thank you Representative I.
A couple of comments in the
question one of the one.
This thing is we're leaving this
meeting with the.
firefighters because they don't
have social security don't have
pension
we do need to be paid into
parents the whole working
careers and they do have a
pension from the state so that.
Needs to be clear
I would ask the sponsor.
The
Now we have to look at
recruitment and retention fund
for firefighters it would be
great if moving forward.
We can do these things together
and so coming back and finding
that balance are searching for
parity after the fact so.
That be something to consider in
this piece of legislation
because guaranteed should go
through we'll be looking at
another bill looking at the same
extension along our manager
transponders two years from.
so maybe all the groups together
and let's be complications if
we're gonna ask the voters to
vote on a constitutional
amendment let's make sure it's
really solid.
And we have a do has motion with
the second is there any
opposition.
All right you have a do you pass
Representative committee we have
completed the items on the
agenda thank you enjoyable for.
