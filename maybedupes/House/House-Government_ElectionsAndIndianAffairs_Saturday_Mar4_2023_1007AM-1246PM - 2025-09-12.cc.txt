The president.
A little here.
Representative reading your.
Representative Zamora here.
Bye ShareFigure off here.
Madam chair here we have a
quorum thank.
We have a quorum this morning
and that we are going to
continue house bill two six
we've had a our introduction
presentation and we've heard
from public comment and we we
have Representative three months
for you have to.
At
present to look
at.
Madam chair representative with
the indulgence for a moment on
May point one or start this
there is a point what I'm
saying.
Of the.
If we look at the Ford lightning
truck this is the electric
truck.
And.
It's.
As a towing capacity of
ten thousand pounds.
So if you buy the upgraded
battery pack each and all it
says and this is
This is motor trend's yes.
It said that
Fully charged twenty twenty two
F. one fifty one the email Water
Street tract has less energy on
more than a regular F. one fifty
with four gallons of gas the
total trailer and they went to
thirty five months before the
end to stop.
I just PNM so when we look at a
typical city block we have eight
to ten homes and are back to
back with power lines down that
road.
So now you get sixteen to twenty
homes.
And you can charge June the
twelve vehicles.
In that walk.
That's the maximum that you can
charge before you over what that
system.
We have seen from California
they have the roving blackouts.
So and in when they have a in
the summer they say don't charge
your car's.
So we have an infrastructure
problem.
That some of the network and a
half to work off
Of the one Representative
brought up how.
Of electric cars are pretty new
the road tax and we need to do
that because we're driving on
the roads renewable get out we
need to maintain our roads.
But yesterday we were at a point
where we were.
The seeker.
So with the.
Madam chair representative
and there was a discussion
yesterday that there's that this
of.
Carbon credit is not going to
reduce fuel costs it.
From California here you know
the article I was reading
yesterday.
They auctioned off those and
then proceeds from these
auctions which last year dram
generated more than two billion
dollars.
So there is a lot of money
that's up going to be paid for
these and madam chair
representative so let's go to
the factory that makes the gas.
So they're going to miss this
fuel.
giving effort by the Kerr
credit.
I don't want to increase the
cost of the carbon credit them
to put it on to the price of the
if you or someone.
Chair representative.
I think the answer questions I
want to dispel again
this.
Concern that you have that we're
we are not talking that part is
market this is not a cap and
trade program which you see the
millions for the billions of
dollars that is not what you're
talking about a little the fuel
Sander credit program very
different from the cap and trade
program and I just I need.
stand that because they are very
good and now I'm going to ask my
experts to address.
Good luck with that could limit
again Madam chair representative
at I think that there's some
confusion and some speculations.
Madam chair representative what
I would see is that we don't
know the producers are going to
impacts in our New Mexico.
Program which is why we have put
together a field that has the
program be authorized by the
environmental improvement course
but that that's just
authorization the program will
be designed as part of the
rulemaking process and in that
process with the amendment we
had yesterday that cost to
consumer has to be considered as
part of a well designed.
Well Madam chair representative.
Representative.
If you so yeah absolutely is
there some credit they have to
fight to offset your review
will.
Madam chair representative to
define day sorry.
Okay let's go ahead and madam
chair and and the experts so we
started.
So the pre-filing is going to
manufacture fuel we're gonna
take crude oil into fuel.
They're gonna sell that I hear
in the let's just take
California.
If that for factory have to buy
some type of credit.
Because it's a dirty fuel that
there's someone.
Madam chair representative on if
if you are on referring to the.
But the fire is producing as one
that would be radically a high
carbon fuel in the program that
is to be designs
we don't.
Assuming that it's a high carbon
fuel and it doesn't need the
benchmark that would be
developed rulemaking that on
site for the fuel meter would go
to the.
fuel up more food to market and
I okay.
to.
But.
Address the fact that has fueled
is hi Marvin.
And I was two over to come to.
Madam chair of the.
In addition no we have to one I
had in the state the hoping to
finally has the peace plans.
He currently leads to help for
market.
If that were one of the sources
of fuel for the state they don't
have.
The ability to to reduce.
The local intensity of the few
that do this I also Sallee
renewable diesel into the New
Mexico.
Okay in madam chair.
thanks for so you're talking.
These and that is a credit right
that would generate a credit.
What would cost for that credit.
Madam chair experts that for
them getting them.
That cost is going to be on top
of the gas.
Or do you think that there's so
much profit in the fuels of
production that they can just
sort.
But.
It's hard to say this point we
don't actually have a New Mexico
program on to explain all the
details but what I can tell you
is that as far as our New Mexico
for Graham goes our deal
provides express language in the
statute that says cost to the
consumer must be considered as
part of this well designed
program and so that is one of
the issues that we will being
with all the stakeholders come
together just we're making
process.
Chair representative those
stakeholders also producers for
that is.
That's part of that so having
those conversations and.
The producers outlined their
concerns is part of the the task
force with the committee the
advisory committee's process
before the city and the.
madam chair was go back to where
we started on this the.
Triple a have the price of
gasoline in California for
eighty six a gallon and New
Mexico was three thirty non.
I think that is it is showing us
that there's a cost for this
program.
And madam chair and
representative on this paper
here.
It says California's are the
most part drawn if it's top
credit price of two hundred
dollars per metric.
So.
Hello do we agree that one
gallon of gas news twenty pounds
CO two.
Chairman representative
I want to address the first
point that you were.
Referenced as far as the price
goes
the.
Our.
Gasol race in California has
separate excise taxes and as we
discussed earlier California has
stayed completely separate
topics street program that adds
additional cost to.
what the California gas prices
those taxes.
Program in California do not
exist here in New Mexico and
what we have seen is that the
There is no correlation between
this particular program
California and price of gasoline
and that is true in the program
that we have data for in order.
Madam chair and.
Experts so we agreed that
they're gonna manufactured gas.
They're going to have to.
Why our carbon credit.
Right.
Madam chair representative only
if they don't meet the
qualifications of reduction of.
Of greenhouse gas emissions.
Production okay madam chair and
of Representative so we're
making thirty guests both the
refinery is making thirty guests
like we're getting right now at
the palm.
And they're going to have to buy
a credit because they're making
if you will thirty guests can we
agree on that.
Madam chair I don't know if we
can agree on you many for the
factories producers there are
making lower carbon intensity
transportation fuels the market
is seeing that way so I don't
know if we can agree on that I
don't believe we can.
Madam chair and representative
in California for the gas so and
for a program that's similar to
this that you're proposing do
they have to buy.
Of carbon credits.
Madam chair representative there
is a very distinct difference
between the cap and trade
carbon market that
Requires
I don't know much about the
California because we do not
have that here in New Mexico
that.
Requires some kind of
transaction that affects the
price of gasoline called.
in New Mexico
that we do not have that
program.
And so it it's hard to answer
that for you just because of the
difference programs and chair of
the this is in that program it
will be a program.
Madam chair representative.
If we're going to sell gas in in
New Mexico.
And it produces CO two.
Is that is that corrected it
produces CO two.
Representative yes.
Okay madam chair and
representative so with produces
CO two.
And of course we have to buy
carbon credits to offset.
The CO two produced by gas.
Is that correct managers and
if the we are referring to is
the consumer I would say that
would be enough.
Madam chair and expert will the
refinery produces.
The gas one that sold in New
Mexico that produces CO two.
Have to buy a card and credit.
Madam chair representative they
will we don't know how much it's
gonna cost if they do not
produce fuels that meet the
standards.
That is listed thank you.
Twenty percent below sea levels
thirty percent of twenty
eighteen level section for a
twenty to twenty percent.
And madam chair representative I
think maybe one of the points
that is a station is that a
carbon credit is a paternal hard
for cap and trade system and
this is not a country system so
Perhaps a reference to a few
will try to if you could call it
fuel.
But madam chair expert just so
we have a correct this fuel to
credit is a carbon offset for
one metric ton.
Of CO two correct.
Madam chair representative on it
is not offset
Which is.
Madam chair representative that
is eight it's a market.
That allows deficit generator to
be able to I from the market of
fuel credits to offset their.
Madam chair and
I think we're now finally
getting that.
The refineries gonna produce
fuel it's going to be sold in
New Mexico.
Because it produces CO two were
we will have the refinery will
have to fight.
This fuel credit.
Are we agreeing on that.
Madam chair representative on I
would see that depends on the
refinery because refiners need
full of different kinds of
products not just products that
might be a deficit in the to be
maintenance program and so it
could be that that refinery for
example that misfortune
discussed also has a beautiful
components that are caution
generating credits fuel credits
in income stream that would
offset their need to buy credits
the fuel market so
Yes okay.
Madam chair and expert that was
go ahead make the refinery does
not take anything but dirty
gasoline unleaded gasoline that
you drive up to the problem that
you fill your car up with.
The refinery them is going to
have to purchase this fuel
correct.
Based on one metric ton of CO
two.
Is that correct.
chair representative
Hypothetically if a refinery
didn't have other state we're
making.
Perhaps they would have the need
to only by fuel credits but no
refinery we're we're only half.
Most refineries have a variety
of products that they produce so
In a hypothetical situation that
might
that might occur and
To the second point it's not a
it's a hard credit responded
carded contents sorry credit
based on the carpet in the
tent city of that for you all
and so that Harding infants
standard has yet to be set so
that if we it's hard to
answer that.
And so I think where I would
what I would say is that we have
a rulemaking process where a lot
of these issues will be
addressed as far as.
Even if you know the oil
producer the industry at the
table wants to go through these
different exercises to try to
understand.
When making would be a great
opportunity for that but it's
hard to
find concrete answers without of
New Mexico design program in
place at this time
I can tell you that as far as
the
this bill just has the approval
for this conversation to take
place in the whole making
process and
you know cause it to cost the
consumers in statute that would
be part of that part of statute
those cost considerations for
all.
Madam chair and expert can you
tell me a refinery.
In the US that supplying fuel
to.
California Oregon Washington
that doesn't have to purchase
fuel credit.
Madam chair representative
engine off top of my head.
C. Madam chair of expert I think
that's the problem this graph
right here shows Oregon and
California and the cost of fuel
pressure from about they're
they're sold all the you know
monthly it's kind of like a real
estate broker they're out on the
market there's someone and it's
ranging from about a hundred
fifty to just over two hundred
dollars per metric ton credit.
And so they're they're gonna
have to go in my nose
When when we look at New Mexico
and it's very rural.
Last year did you
Representative did you have
Madam of justice in India.
The I thought.
Getting ready I was in a room.
Madam chair representative so
we're rural state and I think
that most people drive about
fifteen thousand miles per year.
And so my research was that one
gallon of gas is going to.
Eight twenty pounds of CO two.
Whether you get thirty miles a
gallon whether you get fifteen
months ago.
So if we say that we're gonna
drive.
Of the fifteen thousand miles
per year and we get
Fifteen miles to the gallon.
We're gonna use
For any use of thousand gallons
of gas.
If we have a thousand gallons of
gas at twenty pounds per.
That's twenty thousand pounds or
ten times so at the carbon
credit of two hundred dollars
that's additional fuel costs of
two thousand dollars.
For fifteen thousand miles now
if you go to thirty miles a
gallon.
It's an additional fuel cost of
a thousand.
has that vehicles.
Fifteen miles per hour and has
the vehicles that get thirty
miles ago.
And the problem with that is
this hurts the poor the hardest.
Anyway I don't know Madam chair
representative if you have a
call on.
Chair representative I.
I want to talk about what this
bill does.
Eight it it provides options few
options for for everyone it
provides options around carbon
fuels it once.
More than seventy percent of New
Mexicans want low carbon fuel
options and we talk about your
issues that carbon emissions
were really talking about
missiles carbon intensity of
tools which is how which is how
we're creating the market we're
looking at the infants the
lifecycle of the of the of that
fuel production
that's that's offering that
first movie packages for
of chair representative I would
say that
To echo Representative Ortez is
comments there are
Choices that consumers will have
a tough and this bill and a well
designed program will provide
those choices
also any.
Program designs in New Mexico
will be tailored for New
Mexicans and Mexican one and the
expectations New Mexicans have
that is the guiding statutory
language in each before twenty
six
we are going to be using fax the
science what went into this bill
and that's what will guide we
hosted rulemaking process
getting to some of these issues.
Madam chair of.
We have the fuel refinery in New
Mexico.
On chairman archer I move for
this my understanding that New
Mexico imports most of its fuel.
So madam chair experts.
So the fuel is made outside New
Mexico it's going to be brought
into New Mexico are they going
to dedicate the special section
of their refinery to make only
fuel for New Mexico when we have
more populated states that are
using more fuel than we are.
I chair representative I would
say that
The
There will not be need to create
new fuels for New Mexico
specifically because other
states already have these
programs and actually this bill
what are.
Estimates because it happened
that clean fuel producers will
actually come to Mexico and
create a new clean fuel markets
and produce jobs economic
investments
eyes out on materials yesterday
there are.
thirty over thirty businesses
producing all kinds of.
That are here right to expand
and we in the wings to provide
the jobs and the first time that
will help all New Mexicans and
so that is one of the driving
goals of this program.
Madam chair and representative
but we don't think anyone in
this room or
here in this building don't want
cleaner fuels don't want cars
that get better gas mileage I I
think we can all agree on that.
What I'm trying to point out is
going to be a cost to consumer
if the producer has to increase
his production.
costs by buying twelve it's
going to be placed on to the
gasoline costs it is going to
cost us more at funds that
support and trying.
And and you seem to disagree
with that.
Madam chair representative that
is not the evidence that that
that we've seen from for you in
California that there has been
increased costs the consumer.
However he has higher gas prices
but they always and it's because
a lot of other factors not as a.
That that the reports that you.
At that.
Madam chair and Representative
is California or Oregon
Guests older having to purchase
of fuel credit.
Of Representative but chair
representative consumers do not
purchase your products.
Okay madam chair and the expert
I agree with they don't
purchase.
Does the refinery that produces
the gas sold in California have
to purchase fuel credit.
Chair representative dependence
of most refiners and producers
are producing a variety of of
fuel options biodiesel low
carbon fuels.
Other types of fuels and within
their within their process the
maybe generate credits and
needing credits at the same time
so that's that's the experience
that that refineries are are
having in in California
and Oregon.
Madam chair and
Representative that's not the
reserves are some they're having
to buy fuel credits I mean I
just.
So do this graph and this graph
is the cost of fuel credits the
CO two credits and if the cost
of production goes up.
Then the costs to the consumers
coming.
Increase as well yes
Representative I would say that
we have not seen
the graphic your point but I
will point out that earlier
there was a
miss
our understanding of the cap and
trade program in California and
the low carbon funeral of
program in California
and so without seeing the chart
and understanding what it says
Comment on whether we can see
what I can tell you that the
all.
Instead we have seen all the
reports we have seen California
and Oregon see there's no
discernible costs from a low
carbon fuel program on with the
price of the fall.
Madam chair of the and experts
so.
I mean we just if we go to basic
economics if the production cost
we're talking at the far end.
Of increase the the costs to the
consumers gonna go up that's all
the research that I've seen.
And you know if I if I have to
go by and I was talking about
the service if I have to go by.
A carbon credit.
Then absolutely it's got to be
tacked on to the price.
And I don't see how you can can
the state Falwell they're gonna
make special fuel for New Mexico
and it's not going to occur.
I mean gas is going to produce
CO two areas.
The of the go ahead chair
representative they are already
refiners increases are already.
Yes standards in fact Marathon
Oil move from New Mexico.
This is also making the move to
other states and they're not
here because we don't have the
clean fuel standard here so
they're making but they are
making schools in Utah.
In Texas terms of this is a
chance for New Mexico to become
a leader
and I would say this program
could help.
in the clean market that is
already here already being
developed and we can and it will
help
as part of this program one of
the guy posed is requirement
that transportation of education
infrastructure
receive investment and so
this is already happening in
states that we have this
particular program not the car
then market cap and trade
program
it will not add to fuel costs
late perhaps in California
they're separate how the street
program does it will
allow access to be a leader and
that's already happening
industry that's already
existing that we're seeing
investments being removed from
New Mexico because we don't have
what it takes this bill will
provide what it takes and we
could be a leader here
it's all this conversations
having a national level
we're really excited by the
opportunities increase you also
infrastructure investment and
US investments introspection
transportation electrification
at this bill mandates as part of
the fuel clean fuel program and
that's why we're excited about
this bill and we hope that this
committee the past so that we
can get the story to do that and
start developing the program to
address all these concerns.
Madam chair
Expert was was just stated
today.
So you.
Harm and you get on with a gas.
Then you fill your car up.
And what's assume that they're
not going to change and I was
talking about the producers
refined isn't going to change
the on what it.
Will they have to buy a fuel
credit for the young whether
there's someone to the consumers
in New Mexico.
Madam chair representative if
the producing doesn't meet the
standards they will have to buy
it but I have to tell you it's
not as simple as you're asking
and it's not as simple as I am
trying to make it simple but
it's not it's complex and it
should be petroleum the volume
industry in the economics of it
are extremely complex there's
lots of factors that go into the
price of fuel.
Period is there's training in
production that's happening and
you.
Course that affect the price of
gas we'll all those things play
into you know play into the
price of.
And so it's.
We don't know what to look like
here but we have the opportunity
here to ensure that are that the
most vulnerable the poorest are
not feeling the impacts from the
price of.
Of gasoline it doesn't need the
lower the standards we must act
you must do whatever we can to
provide options and that's
that's what this we get clear
field options we get
electrification options we have
businesses that want to move it
to the state because we have a
clean fuel standard in the home
they can produce of clean fuels
from a variety of products so
that we have options for
everyone so I I'd love to be
able to say yes you're right for
no you're not but it's
complicated we don't know what
we know is that we create a
system that protects our
consumers which is what this
bill does we can create a system
in which folks can buy.
Fuel for their vehicles that are
left the issues that they will
be suffering from fever public
health issues related to
transportation.
Madam chair representative
totally agree with you that the
cross of crude oil is based on
many factors.
I totally agree with that so.
Once we go ahead and we get past
that we're going back to the
gasoline and hard and we and
madam chair in Representative we
do agree that when you burn
gasoline you create CO two.
Yes.
Madam chair and Representative
now that we've created CO two.
We're going to need to get a
fuel credit.
for the refineries gonna need to
advise that the fuel credit and
I agree with you that you agree
that yes they're going to have
to do it if they don't change
the point on at the pump that's
currently there.
Correct.
Matt Madam chair representative
I would say that the land if you
reference that's currently there
is
up to ten percent of the already
and so I think that there are
opportunities to have
Sure.
Cleaner fuel sources are
enhanced by a well designed
programs that will be discussed
in the rulemaking process and
It goes to the point where we're
already seeing this happen.
Let's be a leader for the
southwest region Colorado's
looking at it appears on is
looking at it we can be the
first ones in twenty twenty
right to do it in.
Madam chair and stuff experts
say.
What is the.
Cleaner fuel that they were
selling in California.
Talking about yes.
Chair representative
I'm I don't know if what
California's individual state
program has a carbon intensity
has so I can't answer that
question.
You madam chair in
Representative I think that
unleaded gasoline is kind of
standard across the U. S. you
know there's ten percent
ethanol.
And the manufacturers have said
if you increase the effort all
too high it damages the vehicle.
So I think we're kind of at that
point but Madam chair
representative I would say that
that is true for right now R. D.
but really projecting forward
as you heard yesterday the auto
manufacturers support this bill
investments are being made and
transportation of elector
commission infrastructure
already by utility companies
For our Rosen with very
different very soon as we need
to take of the state in order to
provide clean fuel options so
the folks and this bill is one
of the ways that that will
happen.
Madam chairman Representative
what I heard yesterday from the
manufacturers were that they are
supporting it because the old.
more of elector do it goals in
the future.
And then they see that market
growth and when we look at that
market grows electric vehicles
cost around about seventy
thousand on up.
So they're they're quite
expensive.
Madam chair that that's actually
not sure there's a range are
playing alleged vehicles that
are under thirty thousand
dollars yes is coming out of the
twenty five thousand dollars.
So there's a range of options
and with the credits that that
the presence is the federal
level you can get electric
vehicle for
fifty thousand dollars if you're
looking right so that's what
this is just about.
It really is it's about a range
of options.
It's also about addressing the
real pollution issues we have in
our transportation corridors you
know and if we want to keep you
know
Busher California which I I do.
I come I come from I come from
the most polluted county in the
country.
The mostly county in the country
and there are people dying
because of emissions because of
pollution coming from fees for
vehicles they have to do
California has to deal with all
kinds of non payment issues with
the EPA that I don't want that
for the state I don't want that
for our low income communities
that are that little long
therefore I'm feels like to
bring that back I grew up with.
This is an opportunity for us to
do that and hobby California for
us to the a place that is
innovating and is clean the
dirty air by providing more
options for folks and that is
what New Mexicans want.
Madam chair representative we
have three interstates of that
By sector New Mexico.
And was Korean was take the the
the want to call Senator truck
drivers what they do is say look
at fuel cost.
And so you know they're they're
carrying a lot of fuel they
could fill up in Texas and Dr
all we up you know one forty.
And in the in the Arizona and
then gas up again.
And four eight Bob purchasing
any of our fuel in New Mexico.
And that's something that we see
today you know they're they're
monitoring fuel costs and
they're like any company they
have to keep it down.
So.
To say we're gonna put this in
and we have we're gonna stop yet
the border and you're gonna have
your destiny can get our fuel
you know so that we can make the
standard or reducing emissions
across New Mexico won't work
that's Madam chair
representative that's not how
this works.
Thank you madam chair and
Representative I agree with you
and that's why I point out that
you know you can fill up in
Texas and go all the way there
is no or Arizona and go all the
way to taxes.
And not purchase fuel in New
Mexico
under this program.
Madam chair representative.
I.
And.
Our time understanding how why
that would be the case people
stop in New Mexico a long haul
truck drivers are stopping in
New Mexico for all the reasons
that you need to stop.
Eads suse yes
this.
This bill and the the E. ID
rulemaking process will create
options for people and some of
those and those options will be
lower options.
We have some evidence Madam
chair representative that
transportation is alley
transportation company they
support this bill because they
know that there will be lower
cost.
So right I'm sorry I was having
a hard time figuring out.
Why you wouldn't what would
happen is the state to take a
Iraq.
Hello well Madam chair
representative I agree this and
stop here they're going each
year but doesn't mean that
they're not going to fill up
their fuel in taxes and not
purchase fuel in New Mexico.
you know one of the things that
we heard yesterday was from the
farming industry that are
tractors burning thirty gallons
of diesel for our.
and then a medium size is
fifteen gallons per hour and
when you start looking at the
fuel credit that's going to have
to be on that the soul unless
they can make it totally twenty.
You just increase the cost of
food.
You agree with that that
Sorry and I would add that we're
there's been also street or if
there is no
Data that supports any
discernible price increase by
low carbon fuel standards in the
states have adopted them.
Chairman.
Experts that's not what one
research showed in here the one
I want to
you know the the fact that we
agreed that if the produce the
what are those are the and days
again the refinery is producing.
The on whether that they're
producing today that they're
gonna have to have some way to
some carbon offset.
Evident another production
facility here they go out and
buy it.
So
Price fuel in New Mexico will
increase just as it's increased
in California Oregon and
Washington.
from all the research I did.
Madam chair and Representative
do you have any idea how much
a gas or diesel is sold per year
in New Mexico.
How many gallons.
With
that in mind isn't Madam chair
representative to get that
information.
So madam chair representative is
just so I understand you're
asking for the the number of
gallons sold per year of
unleaded gasoline.
Madam chair representative yes.
Average or a certain.
No this was state last year.
Get up on stage.
Representative.
Who
was always helpful.
Alexi.
Thanks very.
This Chechen Committee.
Yes the news is here too.
Really have twenty twenty
numbers so okay well we'll do
twenty twenty.
Eight point three billion
gallons of gasoline.
That comes from ceci PT.
On.
Freaky but
you know since twenty twenty if
we have to for Edie's to our we
need to eight our our state
sweets so I don't know.
It looks like but it.
This could be us.
Yes I would Madam chair
representative but knows that
twenty twenty was during the
COVID so you know we.
Probably at this driving the you
know but I think that's you know
it's Representative we had eight
billion that gallons of gas that
are sold in New Mexico.
that produce CO two.
That you know if we had that
program into this program and
the fact in twenty twenty they
would have had to purchase
whatever fuel credit.
To offset that.
Sure sure Madam chair
representative
Gasoline that's produced.
That sold in New Mexico already
has F. and all some of that
already has seven on trade so
those producers are.
Would receive.
What will it for producing
gasoline that is of the work the
work that has a lower carbon
emissions so I I just I believe
that this this
the tone of this conversation is
not based on all of the facts I
think we're looking at different
charts I don't know where Madam
we're we're your information's
coming from that the.
The studies and research we have
does not show that there will
be.
Grease and fuel prices because
the low carbon standard as I
just that's that's just where we
are sorry we're looking at
different things I'd love to
understand where you're getting
your information so that we can.
We can compare but that's just
not overseen.
So madam chair I'm getting more
information on Google.
But the.
Madam chair not to.
There.
Google chrome acts.
Madam chair and
Representative so you're saying
because they already have ten
percent.
Yes and all of them they don't
need to go and do any more.
Or will this legislation
requires them to do more.
Madam chair representative this
legislation require anybody to
do anything other than
come together at a table with
different stakeholders to put
together a well designed program
tailored to the needs of New
Mexicans.
That incorporates that all the
concerns that we're talking
about.
And madam chair.
Representative the purpose of
this legislation is to produce.
Fuels for going the direction of
producing fuels that produce
less CO two is that correct.
Chair representative.
It is one of the things that is
programmed to do.
And madam chair and
representative of.
If we can't produce less CO two
former fuels then we have to go
or the the manufacturer has to
produce fuel credits or purchase
fuel credits correct Madam chair
representative it is possible
the most refiners and
manufacturers are producing a
variety of fuels in their
factories in their
manufacturing.
Places they're producing
biodiesel they're saying on the
Kathleen they're producing
with ethanol at various ranges.
They're producing all kinds of
different things and so within
their company and their refinery
they may be producing enough the
low carbon intensity fuels that
standard with the credits and
the producing some fields that
don't in which case they will
be.
At zero and that's speculative
hello there lots of it refiners
are going toward producing
cleaner fuels.
So that we can meet and meet our
our our climate crisis we can
emissions so that we can produce
gasoline and fuels
transportation fuels that are
less polluting and less harmful
to our the.
And madam chair and
Representative I agree the
industry is trying to do that
madam chair representative can
you give me a fuel it is
currently produced.
That would be sold at the palm.
You know for my and whether it
vehicle that.
Is clean and
the manufacturer wouldn't have
to produce our purchase any fuel
credit if all the the woods just
that one fuel Madam chair
representative we don't have a
program here in New Mexico to
apply that hypothetical to and
so we really can't answer that
question but that will be a
concern that is addressed as
part of the rulemaking process
as is required by the.
Texas bills and yet the statute
itself.
Madam chair and expertise can
you tell me a state where they
sell fuel.
That is so clean that they and
and was just soon the the
manufacturer only produces that
one fuel that they don't have to
purchase fuel credit.
Madam chair representative
different states have different
programs and different.
fuel and fuel producers we the
producers have different
Feels that they produce so it's
hard to apply a hypothetical to
generally since all the programs
are different and again we don't
have a.
Program here in New Mexico but
that's one of the considerations
that will go into the rulemaking
process
that will have you to reset the
table that will have oil and gas
at the table we heard yesterday
for them this one with the gas
company oxy is in support of
this bill
we have environmental
organizations in support of this
bill everybody will be at the
table to take these concerns.
Madam chair thanks for Dale can
you point me will sold in any
state that is clean enough that
they would and and again I'm
going back to the manufacturer
and the only manufacturing that
fuel and he wouldn't have to
purchase a fuel credit.
Madam chair representative I
would say that again that is
really a hypothetical under our
field low income fuels could be
anything that is the slide I.
Thank you for office so that has
yet to be determined.
Representative just want to
remind.
Weeks at the table we have three
bills after this and it's now
eleven and we have to be on the
floor and to and next on the
list as Representative block.
Yeah.
Madam chair of aware of that
okay this is a very important
piece of legislation and I think
it needs to be the whole.
And I haven't even gotten into
the bill we're still trying to
decide whether we have to
purchase a fuel credit.
for gasoline in New Mexico and I
think it's clear in a round
about way that we will send that
will increase the cost of
gasoline is I've calculated.
And I think that's not
beneficial
To Mexico and it's going to hurt
the.
The poorest of the poor the most
a
I I totally agree that we want
to have cleaner air and and all.
But
We're we're going around this
rabbit hole lot trying to to get
that we actually do have to for
the the manufacturer is going to
have to produce our purchase of
fuel credit.
madam chair and representative
will scroll the page to the line
eighteen.
And we see fit stock production
and distribution.
I.
Can you.
For page two wine eighteen feet
feedstock production and
distribution.
Is that.
Madam chair representative you
are asking if the stock
production is farming.
For yes or two what does it
mean.
All
of these.
What I would have a spacing
the attacks.
Madam chair representative
It could you please restate your
question.
Madam chair and expert on page
two line eighteen what is the
meaning of feedstock production
and distribution.
Madam chair representative who
some.
A low carbon fuel
on there from from.
Senator Mitchell oil from
vegetables.
And
order to forget those stop.
That leads production.
And then also at that that's an
example where transaction and
cultural which product.
Sources feedstock can also be
for example what happens in New
Mexico to produce biofuels where
this stock is used cooking oil
from the next set.
The madam chair and
Representative when we go down
the page to one twenty one we go
locations specific fuel
characteristics what is that.
Madam chair representative on
this this section the definition
that you're currently in it's
all about fuel life cycle and so
this entire section creating
question you just asked about
patients specific fuel
characteristics takes time to do
everything from the.
Addition to the use so for
example Rio Grande Valley
renewable the final fuels
production will have to come for
which is the restaurant is all
the used cooking oil coming.
Have that the store's location
some of it is from Clovis some
of it is important Gallup some
of it is from Albuquerque those
location specific feedstock on
the carbon the carbon footprint
of moving that from it collected
source to the refineries and
Limpar
this location specific feedstock
it would be hard for in the fuel
by us thank you.
I also add another this is the
example for I feel but feedstock
could also be for example crude
oil feedstock for gasoline
and so of the important things
to know about this definition is
that it is
But technique this gnostic as
far as the kinds of fuel
the differentiating form is the
Carbon intensity standards that
will be set in the rulemaking
process.
So.
The chair and.
Representative.
Work page two.
And will be at one twenty four
we're going.
On site what was way system we
continue on the top page three.
And then also on page three one
thirteen.
Is it residential on site with
with the system.
So.
We what do septic tank.
Senator Representative this is.
This is for the existing.
Definition of what the board to
do more
work already that said this bill
does not change that at all.
Madam chair representative are
there.
Methane and CO two emitted from
C. of normal residential septic
tanks.
Madam chair representative that
that is.
Literally thousands of this bill
does this bill does not have
anything to do with with a
separate cages cervical
basically and adult that is
already something that you guys
the is.
It's under their purview.
Madam chair representative was
what we talk about is we're
looking at.
The foreign one twenty two
carbon intensity means the
quality of fuel lifecycle
missions is methane gas the
fuel.
Madam chair representative.
We're getting into the
rule making process I think that
We can talk about different
kinds of fuels and what they are
this
What we're looking at here is
the definition section of the
environmental improvement act
that is meant to be amended
through issue for twenty six and
A lot of the definition of what
for example carded ten cities
means or that will be part of
the rulemaking process for all
stakeholders come together as
part of an advisory board and
can decide on what
what makes sense for us New
Mexicans as rapists program
manager Representative what
you're asking is not a part of
this bill it is part of existing
law we're not changing at we're
not mandated.
This this already has something
the IV.
Regulates and has.
Madam chair and representative
read with city system wa but
I'll go back to each one one
twenty two carbon intensity
means a quantity of fuel
lifecycle emissions.
Is methane gas.
A few all.
It could be.
It is.
That would chairperson of.
And
Representative that is a fuel.
And so now when we go over to
the existing language.
We're gonna be talking about the
septic tanks as well.
Representative we are not.
Representative is permissible
regulate septic patients or.
Anything we're doing is just.
What.
Legislation.
Madam chair and.
Representative this this bill is
going to be regulating carbon
intensity means the quantity of
fuel lifecycle you missions.
And when we look at a septic
tank the Mets.
Methane gas.
I agree that the the existing
language talks about of septic
tanks.
So.
You know are we going to look at
septic tanks.
Please can stick to that
contact.
Madam chair I am carbon
intensity means would would of
fuel lifecycle Madam chair
representative added that it is
you know.
Community income stream.
You can sell the credit market
I mean there's really we don't
know what the program is
actually going to do because we
have to go through the rule
making process and that's really
going to define the scope of
what can happen under this
program we know that it's going
to reduce air pollution it's
going to create jobs and created
for New Mexicans and it's going
to.
Help us reduce carbon emissions.
Madam chair and experts that is
one of the problems I have with
this we we have no vision of
what it is we don't know what is
going to be we can't predict
what is going to be so we have
no vision of it and I I think
that that is problematic and and
go ahead.
Representative.
Chair representative I I really
we we disagree completely is
there is a vision.
We have.
Some guidelines we have produce
emissions we have a vision of
creating options that are less
expensive for people yes
we have a vision of.
At building businesses that's
our that's our that's our vision
for this so.
Madam chair and Representative
so when we go to page seven and
we got a one fifteen.
And we talk about this committee
that's going to come together we
have no idea of the size of the
committee.
Madam chair representative I
think that's the size of the
committee is to be determined of
the purpose of the advisory
committee is to ensure that we
have.
And that that committee the
advisory committee
representative are.
Unity's represents the
producers.
Those that happens.
I
chair of of all come back to
and speak a little bit later but
I'll go in the past right.
I've been talking.
Our.
At all all of.
Thank you.
Hey.
We have
Representative lost all pass for
now thank you madam chair okay.
Committee members and chairs of
half a second.
Checked and I Lujan sorry.
Distortion impact is going to be
retract that sorry.
This is so we have a motion for
order and to pass okay retract
that but.
Three.
I don't want to.
We already have a motion on the
table and.
By Representative I I share to
pass in the second by.
Representative you are.
But the question.
So.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative and tricks.
So.
We're talking about some other
states that.
These kind of program Madam
chair representative.
Can you tell me how this program
that we would put in New Mexico
would be with her.
Then those health twenty
Washington or Oregon madam
chair.
Chair representative.
I don't know how will be
different but the focus.
This will be on ensuring
consumer protections on reducing
emissions on provide options and
creating incentives for
businesses that are creating low
carbon fuels.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative so.
We talked today about some
programs that have similar
attributes of those that we're
discussing today so we're saying
that they would completely
different from those in
California Oregon and Washington
from the ones we would
potentially have New Mexico
madam chair.
As a representative unless the.
Likely from.
Similarities there will be some
differences that are focused on
Mexico.
Okay.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative so.
We're talking about the folks
who could sell these credits.
Could they be this is the PNM so
credit Madam.
Okay and madam chair
Representative.
Looking at.
Version the line numbers the
definition of transportation who
is in the amended version of
those and I just want to add
that means like to city or
liquid forecasters will that
just landed school supply used
for offer for sale to power
vehicles work with me for on
services provided to make
corrections.
I was looking at the.
The representative thanks for
the information so that
refinery.
With the support we provide both
in the state and then outside of
the state madam chair
representative.
Madam chair representative.
I just need with that market
with a participating in the
market that's correct Sir.
Thanks for.
Orders are of the state.
Thank you Representative so you
know we spoke a little earlier
about half past three programs.
The chair representative.
Would forward Catherine street
program with this bill.
Chair representative not get
injured.
Okay thank you madam chair
representative.
So.
I guess my question would be.
Regarding the producers are
invited to.
To work on this bill and this
graph Madam chair representative
Madam chair representative.
Many cities and will continue to
participate this program.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative please list those
for me Senator.
Madam chair representative
Occidental.
Chevron.
Because of their own gas
producers.
If you.
Here Representative PNM thank
you madam chair thank you
Representative so I mean from
those folks we spoke about
Occidental's than when I
entered.
Actually I find support
Representative the independent
oil producers madam chair they
testified of the day in
opposition that you know why the
yes Representative also
participate in the
Representative.
Lots of oil producers
I don't know chair
representative by the officers.
I will say that they will
participate in the process of
determining what the market
looks like a programs like thank
you madam chair thank you
Representative what if years.
At the folks who could probably
likely afford to buy critical
such as large users are the ones
supporting this where is
independent producers it may not
be as large then this part of
that the at least from the
testimony some.
Representative.
You for that.
Chair representative I'm not to
speculate on why they are yes.
Okay thank you madam chair thank
you Representative so earlier
today we talked about how this
could affect that prices.
Madam chair representative
Can we with absolute certainty
promise the people of New Mexico
today that if this bill passes
madam chair gas prices will not
rise The New Mexico due to this
legislation Madam.
Chair representative I can't
answer that.
Madam chair representative
thank.
Answer that in that way.
Number of times.
Happy to continue to state
and select that you're bound to
ensure that we're protecting the
consumers that is what that is
and then.
Okay thank you madam chair thank
you Representative so.
Yes we're talking about other
states we said that the data
does not prove that.
Raise the price is that correct
Sir in other states that have
similar programs.
Chair representative the data
does not support spaces.
Thank you madam chair
thank you Representative please
find other than that one study
that we saw.
Handed out to their end users
Representative we.
Arsons Representative happy to
send this to this.
Thank you madam chair thank you
representative will I.
And.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative well did we send
data directly from the
department of energy environment
or any state prison yes chair
pardon me for interrupting that
I'm gonna give you about ten
more minutes and then I'm gonna
call the question I think we've
had ample time to think this we
have four other bills that we
need to get through thank you
madam chair I think there's a
there's a lot of us great that.
I'm asking you respectfully
thank you madam chair I
appreciate it follow try to be
very.
So madam chair representative
well I'm looking at data that is
much different from what we've
heard today.
Earlier today is that there's no
data correlating.
After this is with the increase
stand.
Chair representative I did hear
from the Oregon department in
the final.
The department is in its own
annual report madam chair.
Says average cost of clean fuels
per gallon of the tenant just
gas.
The rise point zero five that's
five cents per gallon of gas
madam chair.
Senator.
And then for diesel madam chair
that would authorize I the five
cents per gallon.
Madam chair representative.
Would you like to amend the
previous statement saying that
this would not rise the price
Madam.
To
walk yes.
Is
The report will be sent to this
on talks about potential to rock
to please press that much if all
those that have those providers
to the credit markets in order
to address the with the
reduction because.
It is not based on actual data
is calculated estimates on
potential increase recent
incentives because that is not a
study of what could be some
placed into get looked at
actual.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative so I'm reading
this study right now from work
and.
Environments are not quality
says very plainly average cost
of bills program for down costs.
Five cents per gallon more and I
can give you the link here if
you find that Madam chair but it
says that very plainly on the
page on the website Mr the
potential is is the cost center.
and share clock if you look at
what it says is actually
do have a four needed it most
times one page long is is very
clear that the house based on
how the calculations and may the
assumption is that if all the
credit providers had to go to
the clean fuel market to offset
their costs then then indeed the
price would be as usual however
there's no and.
All writers are having to go to
the clean fuel market and
therefore incurring this cost
and therefore passing this cost
on to consumers for the retail
price of gas.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative.
You know this is not what I'm
reading here this is not
accurate madam chair
representative but I will I will
continue so in Washington the
Washington department of ecology
support from last may madam
chair you see that as well.
Madam chair representative but
it it's stated that it projects
that by twenty thirty one the
low carbon fuel standard will
add nineteen point three cents
to the cost of a gallon of gas
Madam chair representative.
So in Washington they're saying
it's gonna cost nineteen point
three cents by twenty thirty one
Senator.
Doesn't that this proves your
previous statements this that
said that this would not raise
prices yes madam chairman that's
projections and things are
changing constantly with the
markets.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative I'm sure we could
say the same for this
legislation madam chair because
they well it's just a production
it would only raise that sent
and madam chair representative
could potentially raise a thirty
cents we don't know but at least
from where it already is in
place madam chair the department
of ecology from Washington is
saying that it will raise the
price of gas nineteen point
there is not projecting
potentially thank it will madam
chair so I can give you the link
to that as well Madam.
Of.
By here and.
Sturgis
Again.
This is this study looks at what
would happen it's a projection
the best report we had as well
as actually happened in
California that shows that or
that the those that have had to
comply with the clean fuel
standard have taken actions in
that very complex economic state
that oil and gas industry
handled carbon fuel producers
operate in the bottom line what
is actually happening on the
ground in the market that's the
place for over a decade this is
the low carbon fuel standard has
not resulted from the price
impact with the retail gas gas
prices for consumers at the pump
so you know economists do the
best they can when they
projected future when you look
at what's actually happened
that.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative I'm glad you
brought up California so thank
goodness so California madam
chair representative the energy
department of California wrote
on its website.
Filling up the tank of gas in
California also cost more due to
a special guest wing recipe that
reduces air pollution Madam
chair representative so the
state of California itself.
Admitted on its own website and
the department of energy that is
higher costs of fuel currently
because of this claim center
Madam chair representative so if
we're talking about the long
term effects managers Department
energy is saying that itself
madam chair.
Representative we have to repeat
that.
California.
California is has a carpet
capture the program which is
separate from this they also
have the fuel standard which is
very different from eight cap
and trade program health also
has non attainment issues that
they're dealing with because as
the eight eight for edible
amount of tuition fee and ten PM
to four five that is affecting
its residents the so that goes
into the to field costs as well
as that is the program is not
the reason why
the prices are.
Thank you Representative then
why does the department energy
California State the office of
what you just said.
There are easy having to program
in all his years of programs if
they have in their states are
different than
this of program.
Mexico.
Thank you madam chair thank you
actually the state at the cap
and trade program have the facts
madam chair but they also list
alongside that special guests we
recipes.
Environmental Protectobots costs
and taxes madam chair
representative so it is one of
the factors madam chair that
does include the higher cost of
gas in California Madam chair
chair block the Representative
block on this could you if you
it's special special gasoline
recipe the professional services
you get us that is about them
reaching team goals that is not
required I thought a special.
In the land Kerr's and upon so I
don't see anything in the quote
that you just read off the car
views you're interpreting one
set of words to mean something
else thank you madam chair thank
representatives okay your with
your new.
Fuel standards that we would be
putting in New Mexico would we
be regulating the amount of
ethanol and other oil products
within.
A gas Gallup and Jeff we would
be regulated.
Chair.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative okay so for not
regulating what goes into down
Gaston Care then what are we
regulating with this.
On chairman chair representative
we are very intense.
Well carbon intensity high
Curtis.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative seven let's just
say how do we have a low carbon
intensity gallon of gas madam
chair how do we see that.
For the chair representative I
think I know that we spoke.
About this today and.
We'll walk you through it again.
Here Representative block so the
question you're asking is how
does one lower the carbon
intensity of.
Yes
Rider has many options they can
reduce because we talked about
Huntington city is based on fuel
lifecycle emissions they can
reduce the carbon intensity.
We can reduce the cost of
intensity provide the tools to
cover intensive transportation
alright result in the carbon
intensity fuel.
That's how yes the producers
could choose to change their
processes and reduce the carbon.
Thank you madam chair
representative so it would be
during production refinement
and.
And what measures
transportation.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative so how would they
do that.
Given to finish this question
anymore call.
To.
What for example.
Of.
Is.
Our
mission
issue that they can use.
Mechanisms that come direction.
If I could switch to the rules
both cleaner power to to power
in refinery home and they could
also transportation we could use
some low carbon
Of the really nice of us will be
able to access to the US reduce
transportation emissions from
removing the oil and gas from
one place to.
Okay thank you madam chair thank
Representative okay and then so
how to I diesels the fact.
This Madam chair representative
as in all so a.
Palm oil any other kind of
biodiesel how the the affected
by this bill chair.
Chair representative our.
State.
Thank you for this.
Program.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative so they would
with these biodiesel.
Producers they could also buy
credits Madam chair
representative.
Representative Ezzell requests
because they are present your
permanent and see those thank
you madam chair thank you
Representative.
Okay thank you madam chair of so
regarding ethanol.
I've been reading about the non
it's a fax madam chair and
according to Scientific American
says the car right at the onset
of producing twenty percent
savings green has missed nearly
doubles greenhouse emissions
over thirty years increases
greenhouse gases for a hundred
sixty seven years
Representative with us all under
what we know now scientifically
could they actually have to buy
credits because they are
producing these carbon emissions
madam chair representative.
That that is that's a great
question console
Just talk about the party
value of transportation for
field
start to finish okay.
Thank you madam chair so then
they they could potentially have
a credit if they didn't fall
within the.
Benchmarks of yourself madam
chair.
Madam chair representative
Potentially but again it really
has to do with the whole life
cycle of the of the few things
that last.
Okay thank you madam chair thank
you Representative.
All right and so madam chair
representative of how does this
carbon intensity factor
regarding in like at elect chair
representative of a battery for
instance.
How do we measure.
An electric battery on a carbon
intensity since it doesn't
necessarily have a gasoline
madam chair how do we measure
that within this.
Is the system choose to.
By the very are looking at where
the electrons are produced
commissions so she the
production of the.
I'm also looking also includes
the well to.
And how much more energy
efficient most of the.
We are using the electron.
For.
Session two thousand.
The number that.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative well I know the
batteries they require a lot of
cobalt and other precious
minerals that can be toxic
mentor to the environment so
madam chair representative so
there's no provision in this
bill that would affect.
The the the use of those toxic
chemicals in battery meant for
electric use ensure that's the
answer.
Okay thank you madam chair
representative so.
What about.
What about recycling.
These these batteries madam
chair representative since
there's there is a as a cost to
the environment regarding the
batteries can be recycled and if
so does it create any kind of
carbon footprint with the
recycling process for the better
chair representative what is
also of.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative what we did
mention carbon.
Savings through electric
vehicles previously.
And contacts and build Madam
chair representative so.
If we're not talking about this
effects of these batteries.
On the environment.
Now with these electric cars
then how is that not in the
scope of the bill Madam chair
representative just isn't
Mexico.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative.
Okay I think that's something we
may want to look at the future.
To make sure that we are saving.
However costly can and virginal
impacts of those batteries madam
chair members I agree thank you
Mr.
I appreciate it thank you madam
chair thank Representative I
still concerns regarding the
cost of gas I think that.
We've seen at least from the
studies we've spoken about today
from the department of energy.
In Washington.
The department of environment in
Oregon then the department of
energy California all stated
this costs more for these
specific purpose madam chair
representative and we can go
into the semantics madam chair
about well that's a projection
or whatever but this is truly a
cost that would be absorbed
madam chair by the the lowest.
Variable in this equation and
that would be the consumer and
so madam chair representative I
would certainly want to.
A firm that we protect that
individual in the costs so if we
can promise madam chair
representative through this
piece of legislation that we
will not raise the cost of gas.
I love that but we weren't able
prompting madam chair and so I
cannot support thank you.
Thank mentor okay thank you so
we have a vote on the table a
motion by analyze here and the

Madam.
That that man was part of an
agreement with the Sierra Club
and national resource defense
council to ensure that the
environment department maintain
their ability to regulate even
though that regulatory authority
typically is is given by the VA
which is what this bill
addresses more about the bill
itself but that was part of a
compromise
with the introducing and this
year.
Okay do we have a motion to
discuss permanent.
Thank you and the second.
So let's go ahead and
confessions guessing that
amendment committee members who
have comments questions.
yes so thank you very much
representative images mention
talked we did have an amendment.
This is fairly simple but you
said you
The issue that was here called
national.
Resource defense council is that
what is.
I believe it's I think it's
national and I maybe there's the
meeting that support is what I
just said this is the
introducing sure Representative
Chasey but it was the local
there's you have you should have
a letter here Representative
Chasey from the national
associations that support this
piece legislation that was a
issues brought up by the local
chapter that we negotiated on
the next slide amendment was.
On the.
We'll just have questions on
the.
For further discussion on the
amendment seeing none do we have
a.
To adopt the minutes of the
thank you Representative Rehm
enough second you have in the
New Mexico.
let's go to.
Welcome finish presenting your
bill.
Okay just what House Bill reason
I'm the manager.
Refrigerants providing them
solidi financial not prohibit
the use of services for the
installation and listing the
requirement that contain certain
provisions Madam chairman of the
committee what that does is I
think the film lowered by twenty
twenty four as passed in
refrigerant Law and all this
says is that this bill is
account can not the LFC
refrigerants that they can often
and because there's people in
the community.
Their conditions and take these
referred to I'm sure so that's
all of the bill to us if we
don't at this bill with the
federal guidelines many factors
might not be able to ship it in
the refrigerator units to the
state of New Mexico.
I live he garnered one witness
confirm experiences
Mexico with Representative the
air conditioner for treating
hearing institute this is a
built in past and many other
states because of exactly what
the Sanchez said the reaction
from the local codes because the
codes fall about three years
behind with the changes came in
so the federal government has to
twenty twenty the American
innovation and manufacturing at
as a part of that was to get rid
of these very volatile have four
cartons and so this bill will
allow us to have air
conditioning and other systems
come into the state whereas if
we don't pass this bill starting
in twenty twenty four that'll be
all because would be in
violation of federal law and it
doesn't affect the OAG on home
today on any commercial
buildings this is only as a
stopgap measure until local
codes can catch up with what
that federal wilderness and this
is based upon what the EPA's
portion as well yes after.
Thank you so we'll go to the
audience do we have any comments
in support of this bill.
Please just warning was gonna
with the circle after thank you
guys for the amendments of
course
of the State support of this
bill this bill would allow us to
use climate friendly flammable
refrigerants without this bill
we will be able to get the HFC
phase down off the ground
because curry building chemical
and fire codes and some states
prevent the use of anything
will.
Agencies under this legislation
climate friendlier alternatives
other approved by the EPA third
party safety certification
applies I can result in homes
and buildings so we appreciate
the sponsor of making the
changes in the US.
Thank you for their comments in
support of the bill.
And they don't.
This.
Comments in support of house
bill three seven nine.
I don't see any has raised a
committee members.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you for explaining it I wish
there were another way to
accomplish here and without.
Using preemption.
Predictions.
You can have every local
government.
The state in the country so okay
we're making our own decisions.
Seven is there any other way.
Representative.
Here to see unite you have
served for a long time on public
affairs together and you know my
feelings about that so for me it
we we love to work with the
institute trying to find some
other alternatives and share and
so we are we get the problem the
problem is this with with what's
that federal government if you
don't have to mention if you
don't have the ability to to
preempt from the local
governments one entity he would
be out of compliance with what
the federal government is
requiring of us could preclude
these these companies are
sending their equipment in the
state carrier ring those
companies cannot just another
different equipment for New
Mexico and then have different
versions to the other forty nine
states and so we work diligently
to try and find a way to do this
we think this is very good get
to the bottom is different
industries it's good moving
forward and so this is only a
stopgap measure until local
codes can catch up we can do
this for.
So madam chair representative
maybe.
If you have project.
The length of time you need to
put a sense because I might be a
lot happier with this so if
you'll just think about that for
I think it goes toward.
You probably have seen here but
I would be a lot happier if we.
This forever.
Chair of the CCJ.
I can talk to them and see what
this is you know this is not I
think the important thing to
remember here this is not a
single phase.
Change going from the agencies
are for part is that we now use
specifically of one thirty four
a which is obviously if you've
had your condition work on
lately it used to be twenty or
thirty Bucks accounts now in
thousands in certain instances
we're gonna see multi tiered
because the goal here many
factors is to get to a net zero
and so the Cohasset the code
follows behind so this isn't
just a single phase out of the
agencies this is going to be a
multi year phase out as to
improve and use that are less
toxic chemical service this
process.
Representative block.
In terms of the two paths and
the second I have a motion for
it to pass and I have a second
two of the state well.
Representative Lara you.

madam chair if we if.
About preemption now when it
comes to regulating other things
they have no problem whatsoever
with passion so.
These offices.
This is.

For

Decisions on the.
So.
Okay here folks.
Okay on.
The LCS record since.
Israel prepping the amendments
but there tell him that get it
For three seven.
Okay we don't need it by the up
there waiting for me I'm gonna
quit.
Okay thank you madam chair and
senator sitting right now
specifically so we've got.
We need I.
Okay so we just need one person.
I have institutions need Estes
is a retired general counsel for
you and.
And he's been working with
senators on the first two years
on this particular measure it
has made it to the house and
threw Committee spent very late
in the session and didn't get
funded on on the house floor.
And
The press students debate this
bill is the most stable
invention of all time because
there's a little confidentiality
is in included in the Beloff for
the initial applicants for very
high level positions and
rebounded let Mr Estes explained
why he is in favor of the down
by senator Tom.
And representative who sat here
yesterday is is a little under
the weather today so she's not
on
or about the both co sponsors.
Thank you madam chair
representative thank you
I became aware of this issue
when I was doing but I've been
retired for a long time and I
know we speak review of number I
am actually retired lawyers.
Active lawyer anymore I'm just
retired.
But as I notices of a few years
ago that
ATS saw the new school
superintendent.
And had search around the
country and it was twenty
fifteen and they they publish
the names of all the applicants
in response to a request from
the Albuquerque journal
published at age of forty three
applicants and I was just struck
that none of those applicants
was superintendent currently in
another medium size to large
school district there were a few
smaller ones and I make no
representation but the quality
of the people they made the
right people but there's nobody
who was from a place like
Amarillo or friend and receive
the expect Albuquerque tracked
some people who were actually
doing the job and proving that
they could do it and this turns
out to be the problem with this
of the situation we got them in
most other states a great
majority of other states it's
possible for someone to apply
for a job like this and not have
their needs come out publicly at
first in many states if they
become a finalist then there was
public records they have the
right to say whether they want
to be a fine so they can judge
many of the very best candidates
sure that they're happy where
they are it's one of the things
that can do a good job their
life in their communities but
first yeah they have first
perhaps in coming to Los crucis
or Santa Fe New Mexico intrigue
stub and may want to explore but
they will ask will this be
confidential and in New Mexico
we're one of the few states
where people talking have to say
that we will not they.
Anybody can ask for the need for
your name if you say you want to
be can that and I'll say no I'm
sorry I just can't think of
those support systems so in
twenty twenty one Los crucis and
the Santa Fe and Albuquerque all
like would since were seeking a
new school superintendent and
they did not among the all three
did not one single to state
superintendent of all of a large
so
this people just will not I.
The same jobs somewhere else of
they they do not want to lose
their affected swear they are
especially since the best
candidates are pretty happy and
don't have to apply for other
jobs and the fact is that in
most other states if they really
want to make.
They can apply on a confidential
basis and then decide if they
are offered to be a finalist
they can decide to go ahead and
have a or not the and so this
bill provides that kind of
confidentiality for CEO
candidates public sector but
they do have to come up with
three finalists at least I could
have more
and revealed those people put
their names and resumes on their
website which is actually more
than is required by law right
now now it's just give their
**** they all the but so those
names would come out there B.
has to be ten days in advance of
actually hiring somebody so
there's an opportunity to look
into their backgrounds is there
some problem to call the
public's attention the big
argument is always maintenance
this will be to cronyism people
here that in a moment for our
friends.
But the fact that the needs have
to come out it comes paired it
somebody is a relative of
someone the school board or
commission or has some kind of
improper pie or they're just not
all the candidates are qualified
and none of the candidates are
woman or a member of a minority
group or something that's that's
something that the public body
of citizens and the media need
to speak out of state what is
you know you've got here we are
in the most of our state you got
all white males.
Go back and do it over again and
see what you can do a better job
so I support this measure I
think it will it will bring us
into conformity with the law the
great majority of other states I
look at all from and I think it
really improves our chances to
hire excellent people for these
are people who have demonstrated
taxless somewhere else that's
the kind of person you want to
go after so thank you madam
chair and members it is
supported this measures
supported by New Mexico
municipal league Mexico counties
is that Mexico school boards
association.
Mexico coalition of education
leaders and the council of
university presidents and the
back of your hand out to see the
states where there is civil
possible of on effect and with
that are similar to New Mexico
and those were the issues a
little bit on.
So with that and share we're not
trying to be secretive we're
trying to get
the very best highest qualified
applicants thank you thank you
thank you.
Let's go to the audience for
public comment those in support
of the bill raise your hands
please.
Thank you madam chair twice as
an executive director for New
Mexico counties when we first
heard about this issue we
watched it but as of the last
time he ran it we didn't have a
position support in doing that
from our point of the reason why
we're missing the county
managers about this it is a real
issue for them that often if
they apply for something that
ends up in the paper they may
not even be a viable candidates
are not necessarily one of the
finalists but folks in the
position of being at risk for
the current job because all
their elected officials and just
see that they will find some
more so we think it is fair that
if they are finalised clinical
can they know that there's going
to be that disclosure but if
they put their name in the ring
with a large group of other
people we we we feel they should
have some protections thank you.
Thank you let's go to the web
casts I don't see any
volunteers for COVID of those in
opposition to the bill.
Yes.
Of the two thousand nine of well
let me start off vote for this
bill is a vote against democracy
in the fourth state two thousand
nine the use of Farmington Daily
Times sued the city of
Farmington for applications
presented it conducted a private
search that also went on to
District Court and and in favor
one it went on to the court of
appeals in the newspaper one of
the you the city was using the
same argument that they kept it
quiet because private search
is a one of the best outfits in
that lawsuit they could not
prove that that districts and
and of course rules again The
Daily Times favor so
that's a that's an important
question for pieces of this is
that lawsuit create case law and
that's what we live by us is two
thousand nine and even before
that the first lawsuits on the
started in two thousand eighteen
of fort two two thousand and and
I mean nineteen.
But if if what is gone years
your staff the other thing is
that recently of city manager
result.
Was on leave.
During because they are
investigating a the.
Claim that he was talking to
female.
Lloyd is.
During the see what I the
public.
Getting help out the state with
the is this all was in place we
won't wouldn't be able to report
that and so.
We standing is
settled as I'm executive
director for the press for press
association madam chair members
of the committee my name is
Melanie majors executive
director of the New Mexico.
I stand here today in opposition
to this bill.
Yesterday and I found it
extremely interesting when you
talk about democracy and records
representation and debate House
Bill three ninety nine and as
such please remember this bill
would limit access and
transparency the public's right
to know and what's more
important Democracy public's
right to know for more than
thirty years The New Mexico
foundation for open government
has advocated educated and
litigated on behalf of the
public's right to know also
remember couple years ago we did
a survey with all the
legislative officials were
running for office and seventy
two percent of you said yes we
want more transparency in Santa
Fe this bill is the way that you
can prove to me that that
response was not just a campaign
promise but something you really
want to put into action please
do what's best for the public
and do not pass this bill I
appreciate your time today
thank.
Madam chairman members names I
fell on with L. curry publishing
company in general.
Other slot one and fifteen of
federation I do that is not
because I'm a basketball fan
well because ten dollars of when
this bill for the the idea
behind this bill for started if
you are built and they wanted to
not disclose the name of
coaching applicants and then it
became the and that's you bill
and former Rogers testified that
they could not attract a coach's
name and I'm delighted to see
that that now the concern is not
on basketball coaches but on
school superintendents
that the public has a right to
know who has applied for jobs
and if someone is really
interested in a job that they
find attractive challenging
whatever.
The the G. criteria they're
using as I left Albuquerque
twice for other jobs and come
back because I wanted to
somebody truly wants to be here.
There they may help so that the
public knows and use group not
nice there background should be
a problem.
As a result of all those
kingdoms name was he didn't mind
having username early age here's
one of the brightest young
coaches in the country and job
here tractors.
And and that she and the public
knew about and that's why I
think it chipping away at their
for all of which because usually
coaches out superintendents on
is not a good idea and and we
oppose this bill I I hello Mr
education I've dated it back and
forth spent probably nine or ten
years or more
it's just another piece taken
away from the citizens of New
Mexico thank.
Thank you let's go to the
webcast for comments in
opposition.
More H. Smith go ahead.
Thank you I am merry H. Smith
and Albuquerque attorney and a
long time open government
advocates.
I opposed Senate bill sixty
three and its attempt to carve
out yet another exception to the
inspection of public records at
thirty years ago ever was
written to include the
legislature's robust commitment
to transparency.
Stating that it is the central
that all persons are entitled to
the greatest possible
information regarding the
affairs of government SB sixty
three stakes to stop this
transparency door and provides
special rules for people
voluntarily seeking an executive
position in the public sector
employment paid for by
taxpayers.
Do not take the state backwards
and diminish open government and
transparency just to protect the
person who wishes to be a
government executive leave it as
it is an honor the promise made
to us thirty years ago please
vote do not pass on Senate bill
sixty three thank you.
Thank you very thank you we go
back to insert let me Mr Estes
address some of the comments
please madam chair thank you yes
please.
I testified before as my
colleague.
A number of legislative
committees over the years and
the one thing I guess I'm sort
of proud of this is there have
been very good discussions and
that we recognized that public
policy involves trade offs the
there's nothing you guys know
that better than anybody else in
the state.
Up we are I am very much for
transparency and I I think the
the things that have happened
over the recent history of
Washington post New York times
is basically save that country
of but there is a limit to their
various public policy trade offs
and this is sort of like killing
the goose to get the golden egg
at the trade that the cost of
this total transparency that
fall under the German siege is
the cost is to raise the cost of
losing all the candidates I mean
the liver all the candidates who
are actually doing the job some
more as a doing it well and.
Why did their communities and
all those folks simply will not
apply and the cost you know you
trade costs and benefits the
cost here is just too hot now
then on the other side you put
in this provision that requires
that finalists names and resumes
to be disclosed and you know
like this this gentleman who got
in trouble with the sexual
harassment they say well that
would never come out now if you
were selected as one of the
finalists it would most
certainly can help that he was
you know these days they would
be out there it would be clear
that this is a fellow's
under whatever destination for
sexual harassment yes that would
come out and I think that's very
appropriate not every state does
that but I'm proud of this
legislation does include that
and so you could go in the
background make sure that all
the possible people who might
get the job our qualified if
they're not you have to go back
to the well and do it source and
that happens so I think this is
a good compromise actually eight
Colorado this is based on the
law in Colorado and it was a
compromise litter between the
press association there L. and
the of people who want the local
governments in the state so for
so this is a compromise and I
think it's a good.
so very much for your help
chair.
Thank you committee members.
Yes.
Yeah.
Representative will.
Chair representative thank you
Representative Jim.
Of I am curious to see
First thank you for bringing
this bill forward for
consideration second
In this example of a large
number of people applying for
jobs I'm wondering if.
Somewhat familiar with the
hiring process and as the call
goes out for applicants there is
the first list.
A group of alarm generally
speaking a large and then
they're called through after
they've been
At.
It it just it applications have
been that valuation
I am wondering how the.
Whether there's another point
earlier in the process and the
final three for this to take
place have you discussed that at
all
and I ask that because
if in my experience as we told
through the first
For lack of a better description
first where.
Of this will
there will be a.
Depending on the number of
applicants and then it'll be cut
down usually by half if not more
and then there will be top
candidates and eventually they
will come to the finalists that
we have invented and I'm
wondering if.
If the I can see how this would
be a deterrent to some people
who to some applicants who may
not want to divulge.
Benefit and the devils that they
have since that are interested
in leading a company or an
entity that they currently work
for but is there.
And wondering if there's another
place in this process for that
might happen.
and and whether you discussed at
that thank you madam chair.
Representative yes it.
the stresses can.
Madam chair representative it's
a good question
I over the years talk to you and
number of people who are in this
business social have have done
these kinds of things all over
the country they recommend to
read me the number of okay you
can have more and that the the
practical effect of scope having
disclosure for earlier is that
your disposing more names and if
so you might be this close and
says.
A I think that really just
discourages people.
From offline to imagine yourself
if if you have been approached
and you were intrigued by the
possibility of another job
somewhere but and you ask about
confidentiality they said well
it will be confidential but if
you're one of the semifinalists
could be one of in eighty years
I think that your name will have
to come out and awful lot of
people say no that's just that's
too much competition that I have
I I'm not willing to do it
unless I know that really
finalists that shut us and so
that the record experts I spoke
to suggested that three was a
was a good number again it can
be more but that you don't want
to have a bigger than that and I
and one other observation
regarding this it's too hot to
Hartford on the smaller
municipalities school boards and
stuff to have to come up with
more than three or four names it
is a pretty big deal
Your your you is at a smaller
place like playing or something
like that you may not have that
many applicants who really are I
just just the smaller places
there.
And so it's really unethical to
disclose somebody's name if
you're not pretty sure that they
get the job we can be sure that
you want to you don't want to
put the name out there and give
them a false hope that they
might have disclosed their
colleagues wherever they may be
if they're not really qualified
and it's it sounds.
We.
It's difficult really to come up
with it can be difficult to come
up with three or four.
People who are definitely
qualify for that you always get
applicants you know that you say
you've been Representative on
the ball with this process you
get a lot of people but you get
a relative handful of people who
really.
Qualified for for high level as
the CEO positions that there's a
relatively small group and so if
you should say well we have to
disclose more than an awful lot
of people will say can't do it
and some of the this smaller
places just come up with that in
FY in all good conscience also I
dress that just personal
experience Senator for schools
for years and they would have
these.
Mission search.
And we had in the course of that
period time some really good
superintendents were always the
ones who came from within the
system because those searches
did not bring us I'm eight I
remember.
People who were just really
awful superintendents and with
that and that's what came to
mind when is dressed as us to
carry this but because of the
Senators during this if you
could question was would we
consider adding it making five
finalists semi finals I I and I
think you heard that the
stresses of the Jewish state and
it is all.
Our.
I would agree with the.
With the assistance of
assessment of the situation just
to the.
For more people you
The more people.
If you think I was going to be
less people.
If people that there are a lot
of thirty out of state table
take a gamble that this count
three.
If you extend the I.
The the the what people say all
because this is our chances of
the chair of the less of the
lost to agree.
you know I have personal
experience with this.
I for a job in Florida thirty
years and work in Pennsylvania.

That's.
Concludes my remarks to the
moment thank you.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative block.
Thank you thank you madam chair
representative so.
F. I are here for the analysis
here is that the.
This would not apply to nominees
for positions of president of a
public institution of higher as
cabinet secretary or other
political point why is that
chair representative.
Both of the for two of.
I guess this week we had
personal experience.
Thank you Senator madam chair
The reason is it's it's a
different.
Situation when the governor say
we gives the example of the
bill.
A political appointment cabinet
secretaries of whether it's the
president or the governor of
they are entitled when we are on
the board like hiring
superintendent you basically
want the very best.
Person that I use that
experience.
All and their political loyalty
or their loyalty to your program
is.
But.
Of a factor but the governor has
the right to hire someone who is
not only very good at what they
do but this basically boils down
to work as a as a group of
leaders and oils of the
appropriation she's out it's so
I appropriate just to say well
who is the like when you're
hiring somebody for or your job
or someone who's the best is
that it's a very intentional
consideration for political
appointees it's all across the
country political appointees are
not subject to disclosure even
of the finalists this is a
common provision they're just a
different animal.
I hope that.
Nothing is black and white
that's.
What's been shows up is that
don't require disclosures of
All of fortis for disposition.
Thank you madam chair thank you
representative of all you know I
think that that and I need to
add them back in because the the
system madam chair I I would
love to see who applied and in
the name of transparency with
that the.
Warmer sunshine law to allow us
as regular New Mexicans to know
the executive is a point same
kind of chair representative
center expert you know there's
Madam chair representative
there's one other consideration
half of.
Separation of powers is the
power of the and some stations
California.
And all that the governor's some
majority of confidentiality is
carrying out duties and that the
legislature doesn't have the
authority to say you must
disclose the people thinking of.
Avid secretary so I think that's
a that's a consideration here
too it's full of trade offs but
I I I I feel comfortable with
this.
Okay thank you madam chair thank
you Representative so so we
spoke today about political
appointees Madam chair
representative I would see a
superintendent of a school a
political appointee since madam
chair representative if there
would be appointed by the
individual members of the school
board work elect that.
to pre pandemic Madam chair
Representative walking.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative hard enough
Madam.
Hi they're just not.
Madam chair representative of
their they're not the governor
we do this.
Politically appointed madam
chair is that correct because
they vote.
Chair representative they're can
they're appointed by
politicians.
Are they not I will choose for
members as politicians this
public service.
Thank you madam chair
representative will they run
elections something given the
run election to be a member of
school for and Jeff.
Representative law office about
this bill.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative yes it is about
this though because we're
talking about political
appointees these individuals are
appointed by school boards and
staff so.
Going forward here.
Madam chair.
We're only allowing this top
three individuals to be.
Publicly put out there the
correct and chair.
On the server Representative is
a minimum of three it would be
up to three
the hiring entity they want to
do.
Thank you madam chair.
Technically under this bill
let's just say there's ten
applicants madam chair.
And there are.
Six or seven that are very
qualified but a couple of the
folks that were not as qualified
made the final round Madam chair
representative wouldn't be.
In the public's best interest to
know who the other applicants
were just to make sure madam
chair that the top three of the
most qualified Madam chair I
think we have actually provided
that information since the
presentation we have.
Thank you madam chair thank
representative would you please
indulge me Madam chair
Madam I don't need to say that
we need to really do our entire
presentation because the
jealously.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative I appreciate your
response however it is not
adequate and I would love
response to my question chair.
The
The response was on this
particular issue send these
individuals
The minimum of three will be
disclosed because at that point
in time the answer to this doing
the hiring it's really serious.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative.
Okay so then why why is it that
we're seeing the presses against
this bill Madam chair
representative we saw in New
Mexico press association without
Christy journal yes we saw the
Los crucis bulletin wide that
these public news entities are
against this bill.
Chairman thank you would have to
ask them and they do.
Yes right here at the beginning
and what is interesting is that
Mister Estes says that the bill
is strong up here which has is
actually quite large five years
support in in the last session
and the session is based on
Colorado law which was agreed
upon by the press association so
for.
It was a compromise I see thank
you madam chair thank you
Representative so is this so
require classified employees
madam chair are they receiving
the same level of
confidentiality protections as.
For the latest.
Chair representative.
Okay thank you madam chair thank
you Representative would you
consider adding those
individuals to this madam chair.
From the server Mr S. to
students about because he works
for you and I'm not it these are
two different.
Madam chair representative of it
was considered early on in the
Senate committee not the session
but several sessions ago and I
think the we reserve judgment of
that committee that it would be
better to the stark this
responsive switchers the most
important.
It's most important job category
for this purpose.
Okay thank you madam chair thank
you Representative so than CEOs
who falls under CEO with that
county manager city manager
madam chair with the following
that.
Since the with.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative so what about.
The deputy county manager.
Go ahead isn't it of.
Madam chair representative no
would not.
I see.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative so it's just say
this individual.
Who's the county manager.
Retired and the deputy county
manager stepped in as an
interim.
Number.
Chair representative since there
would be a new process that
individual with that have to go
through this same process
outlined in this bill Madam
chair.
Representative I would say not
for his service is a reporter
services interim.
But if wait when they get to the
point of hiring permanent yes.
Just shoot it.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative so would you
agree that the title or the job
description of city manager
account manager is a very public
role were they would have to
interact with the public Madam
chair representative.
Charters quest.
Sure chair representative would
you agree that county manager or
city manager is a public role
serving the public it is so.
Yes please.
I'm trying to clarify your
questions Representative so
thoroughly answer and I'll
appreciated you don't tell me
whether Senator.
You understand program chair I
just.
Block.
Would you please be respectful
in here to quorum yes madam
chair.
Please listen the.
If.
Certainly the
Not not deputy county manager
just coming.
Madam chair the county manager.
Sure.
Individual interacts with the
public likely.
We have the the inspector
director dissociation counties
here she needs to
elaborate on this for us.
Madam chair.
Thank you madam chair and
representative locked so yes the
county managers consider the CEO
for the county and I believe
that the state would be for the
city manager so they would be
subject to this that would mean
that if they were applying they
would have to release the top
three finalist positions as
the expert witness mentioned it
wouldn't apply to the W. if they
stepped up to doing in terms
this would be for any of the
actual hiring process is I agree
with.
Which rejects the concerns of
them having to present
themselves I can.
Convention retail.
Our plan for thank you madam
chair thank you Representative.
Well since we've we've now
proven that this individual is
very much public.
Public individual.
And I think that the most
scrutiny available it's it's a
good thing Madam chair
representative.
So I think that if we could.
Yeah I just don't know about
only three or four limiting it
to three because madam chair we
could potentially only disclose
three and then if we only
disclose three and don't see the
rest of the individuals who
apply madam chair leaving some
good individual table is there
any response that chair
representative madam chair
completely
To this discussion on next
Monday.
Representative given that we've
just lost form again and we have
so many bills out I think the
both at least is going to have
to wait until Monday thank you
yes.
Percent.
The representative in thank you
for the remaining this has never
lived through the.
We will and.
Public discussion and debate
discussion on this bill and then
they just up with street both
move on Monday Jan.
Thank.
In.
And I think the chair for about
to announce for thirty five
hundred and it was roled in the
Sanchez request today so that is
the last bill that we.
for thirty five.
Is probably not going to be on
for Monday
given.
To hear from the sponsor with
state.
Okay.
And that.
