Gentleman from the Raleigh area
as the non speaker it's always a
pleasure for me to kind of a.
address the chamber when it
comes to some you get a County
the state of New Mexico has the
most speaker because my roots.
Kind of going away deep in that
area Madam speaker you know the
status was granted spent the
Mexican and grant.
right around the turn of a the
transition of power from Spain
to New Mexico and I want to say
that grant was issued on
eighteen twenty three or sell
and there was a group by the
most because of people from.
From this on the bottle.
That's where the families
mainly
came from in terms of the first
settlement in two Las Vegas was
from some media that the the
bottom.
And in that group of our
families was my great great
grandpa.
Fund of yours my essay.
And the the that is the most
because the gentleman that led.
The incursion into the the Las
Vegas area to settle it was a
set of aka.
And as the most because of a.
The the the contingency included
the.
Spanish families that also
included in the set of families
as the most Baker.
In use at all as a were.
economically uprooted Spanish
speaking Gonzales size
economically uprooted brought in
an Indians is the most Baker.
And that that group that
secretary of the new settlers
comprised in many instances a
large push portion of the
families that settled.
That were granted the Spanish
and Mexican land grants as the
most because what's more speaker
make a long story short.
Center I'm calling in with his
family's.
Vacated Las Vegas because the
committee one have any part of
any Spanish settlement in that
area so there is to setting and
that a lot as the speaker.
And about four years later they
tried again this time under the
auspices of my that that I went
to my great great grandfather
funded us my essay and they were
able to finally settle that
portion and one was my as it was
known as on.
Kind of a.
Mediator of peacemaker.
In that whole area.
Because of this authority he was
I've got them I Mr is the most
Baker the Las Vegas Land Grant
and I've got in my yard which is
not a regular more tight leader
of the land grant they had
judicial authority to settle
disputes as the most eager.
so that's that's what I wanted
to share with the body that the.
That lasted us with the most
because I wasn't living in that
city school of which I'm also in
their I'd be little messing us.
That's that's my second home you
know from from where presently
in the side and so if ever I
make a move anyone New Mexico
it'll be to to Las Vegas is the
most popular just one last note
about the industry with my great
great grandpa.
Right after a.
The to do it will be I'll go on
then this admission a turtle
government government there were
a lot of these of Ford's a lot
of forts that were established
around the Las Vegas area.
And my great grandpa
Was also the first.
Officials that was sworn in by
the new government.
And that happened in nineteen
forty six when general Kearney
came into Las Vegas on his way
to kind of protocol conquer.
Mexico in the southwest.
And
I was greeted with open arms by
my great great grandpa who was
kind of my lord at that time in
Las Vegas to see more speaker
R. Peroni actually swore in my
great great grandpa as the first
official.
of the dog.
Of the new territory.
And then also proclaimed that
the class and sent and I spent
us that now New Mexico was under
the authority of the United
States.
Territory.
Just last week
General pony didn't do that in
Santa Fe.
The in Los Vegas.
And that is the most because
Shortly after the Americans kind
of establish the fords similar
speaker
there is a lot of abuse by some
of so American soldiers in the
town of Las Vegas.
And and they were also not
making timely payments to the
merchants and there is a point
of right.
And sexual abuse of some of the
native Hispanic women by some of
the soldiers.
And my great grandpa stood up to
them.
And basically
Ordered all the merchants to
stop making to stop orders for
the forwards until they paid in
a timely manner.
And that there is some
consequences.
That followed after that.
But this amounts because that's
a type of our individual my
great great grandfather was and
And that is one one historical
figures in my family and
And I can trace its heritage

special occasion to honor former
colleague at a later time at
this moment I'd like to ask for
a moment of silence in
Recognition honors memory of
John Paul Taylor our state
representative who was probably
the most beloved member of this
body who ever existed he was our
conscience and if we can have a
moment of silence now and then
perhaps we can honor the
gentleman at a later time thank
you Mr speaker please rise for
Melissa's.
Thank you members.
Thank you gently thank you Mr

I move echoed about order
business third reading of
legislation.
To no objection it is so
ordered.
Members are gonna do one item
this morning before breaking
into joint session is a gentle
lady from earlier ready and item
number five.
Is Mr speaker you take me to
that point the record reflect
that election is serve replacing
house bill seventy eight is
amended on final passage has
been taken it is now subject to
amendment debate for
substitution the gentle lady to
explain the bill.
Thank you very much Mr speaker
house bill seventy eight as
amended removes the sunset
sunset date of a distribution of
the gross receipts tax to the
state aviation Fund while also
increasing that same
distribution of the gross
receipts tax with that I stand
for questions there's a big the
generated from going on a trip
to the Ferrari.
See you there is a bit on the
bill the gentleman from someone
resembling.
Thank you Mr chairman does
agility from Bernalillo yield.
Yes my good friend from San Juan
County.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady just a this is a simple
Moving of a date is that correct
since that day.
Mr speaker and gentleman not
just it is elimination of a
since that date and it also
changes the gross receipts tax
distribution to the aviation
fund of the state.
Thank you Mr speaker this one
does away with the with the
sunset all together Mr speaker
gentleman yes it does thank you
Mr speaker and gentle lady why
what was the need for a limiting
that sunset altogether.
Mr speaker gentleman usually
when the Legislature implements
a sunset date to a distribution
it's because we want to be able
to have the legislature come
back and
recognize and take stock of
whether or not that particular
distribution is working if it's
an effective way for New
Mexicans to be spending their
money and if it is should be
continued down the line.
Thank you Mr speaker lady from
Bernalillo so this fund could
you explain the funds the
members we have a lot of new
members in here and and maybe it
would be worth their while to
understand what the fund does
chair Mister speaker gentleman
from San Juan County what this
fund does is there distributions
of the state gross receipts tax
it funds about thirty percent of
all aviation activities in the
state that means aviation safety
that means ample airport
infrastructure that means
increasing of air routes
throughout the state especially
in our our rural parts of the
state so essentially helps fund
aviation throughout New Mexico.
Thank you Mr speaker lady from
Bernalillo so for for rural
counties in rural airports
there's funds in their their
monies in this fund to help
subsidize a little bit
Routes that may not otherwise
exist from some of the rural
counties that correct Mr speaker
John and it's a little more
complicated than that we have
other funding mechanisms to help
expand routes especially I don't
know if you recall the last
couple years we did the rule
error and Hanson Act which
actually did go to expansion of
routes what this particular
money does to the gross receipts
tax distribution is it helps
keep the infrastructure that is
needed for the expansion of some
routes that we keep the trains
and planes running on time so to
speak.
You Mr speaker I do believe this
is probably one of the
Funds that has had a sunset in
the past that
would likely have this was not a
fund that we would want to have
dependent on a sunset so I look
forward to supporting your
legislation thank you Mr speaker
couldn't agree more on to the
debate generated close.
I thank you Mr speaker I now
I now move that house bill
seventy eight as amended do now
pass.
Our final passage of house bill
seventy is amendment of hell's
with limited is amended the vote
is now open.
Let's let's close.

seventy eight as amended has two
thousand house.
