And madam chair I like to hear
this guy speak because balancer

Yeah.
That'd make question chair
members of this as your question
on who we are and and how we got
here today so the ceremonial Act
has been on and off for.
This year's so and most recently
in the of this two thousand is
twelve and then to local board
came in.
We come in as a volunteer basis
slicer as you mentioned earlier
else right across the
southwestern who produce from
February to November so this
summer on the weekends during
the week is the I guess to
volunteer my time to my
community this really was really
struggling what road is it and
always ideas of how we can make
it better admittedly I took over
as president for as long as a
volunteer coordinator in your.
And under the then president
Reggie Christiansen.
They were able to turn.
And for the rodeo it's rodeo
song and dance with one of our
traditional now hold it stemmed
from traditional levels are
movies now for the social
gathering in a contest sort of
event we have the how all that's
with anybody and everybody is
really for this exclusive now
but it it's about local we've
got an award winning
are so with the resources of the
country's past year we're able
to pay a hundred thousand
dollars to a native artisans
which is it's not just that as
we celebrated our centennial
that very special because.
We are afraid.
Some of those have I performance
is that it all goes back we can
trace every minute we have the
back to the very first twenty
two.
Say goodbye to your question I I
it's in the gross a law so the
state would be able to.
Senator Kristin the eight over
after after his stint as
coordinator then for voting him
board member that it's a
precedent for the ship.
And some of the older board
members and served in the past
came back into the team of the
earth by president it's been an
amazing asset to the team as
well so the way that works by
the south other ideas and how we
can grow the of and modernizes.
More people in from outside.
The.
Right to me and says why.
Since that were and then the
once we finally agreeing.
One was supposed to go to school
this is what we need to get out
all rights success okay.
This year dollar operations less
yes.
But that's the work we really
been able to.
Two of a world renown world
class level.
In two thousand thirteen before
I was able to join the event saw
a total of thirty five hundred
participants through the that
and I'm very proud to say in
this past year's budget.
For the centennial a total of
thirty thousand one hundred
eighty of visitors come through
and it's just been able to grow
at random are still we go to the
LFC rodeo my babies are single
coordinating duties of that
event and I believe the biggest
vote really open to anybody and
everybody in there some rodeos
relief for kids movies only for
native Americans are some really
is only members of certain
organizations.
Quarrel with anybody.
And this year you had nine
hundred ninety six this.
Over twenty five thousand
dollars and it's just I think
it's the story of.
Thank you.
Anything right okay there's
another.
I just like to tell you when we
first came on the same with
really struggle
when we.
Very need to at the office over
it's been under state.
And when we took it there was
nothing left there was no files
no records no computers or
anything like I said we had
thirty five hundred people
through the gate.
So we just put our heads
together and and.
My first idea was to take it
back modernizes two different
things here we had to take it
back to what it was in the glory
days that's what people want to
see they want to see the wagons
and and the traditional grant on
the all the old school.
So we started that in its work
in the really work now four
rodeo go ahead step back from
that because I'm not current hi
is correct he sees what happens
every weekend
we keep things Papen however old
school rodeo which was kind of
my baby
went back again to the nineteen
thirties and next thing we get
six seven thousand people in the
stands it takes six hours in the
day but that thing off and
nobody it's great hello ladies.
Very very we again low again
world champions you have over a
million views on Facebook name
right above the logo
It is is it's crazy that thing
is fun but we did try to take it
back traditionally our artists
were constantly working with RT
Indian country
I need help because we need the
help of right not only the older
ones that.
L. look and lower bracelets but
the number one the students
learn future reference in
conseiller stuff at school
graph.
That's we appreciate your help
anything you can do.
The sponsorship levels as
everybody knows is COVID and I
hate to keep bringing that next
word up the.
The struggle for years source
sponsorship levels are are.
Not where they should be we're
out there all the time national
sponsor state sponsor and we
build a good report
but this the money that we're
asking for.
From you guys school sure.
That we can carry on last year
rodeo costs last year ceremonial
costs seven hundred and eighty
thousand dollars.
That's that's pretty building
for account point that out.
The we made it work we've got a
little money in the bank
and we want to carry that offers
as we had over four hundred
dancers just in our parade on
Saturday.
Four hundred from all over the
United States.
There were there it was crazy
right to left are.
So it's it's kind of fun
interactive line dances with the
same thing.
We just like your health.
As the base.
We're not with we've got hate
you know if if if by chance we
get the three under we still got
to come up with another five
hundred are still and like
gossip this board is also on the
there is no we have one paid
office person and she doesn't
make much but that's it
everything else in our community
is all local in my lives are
they do they are they sleeping
there that's why I want to get
it back to the local run
organization and keeping both.
One of the all.
That's all folks thank you.
Thank you Mr madam chair
colleagues I just want to add
that yes this will sure our
local communities and our
families to continue that
traditional and cultural
heritage that we've been
presenting to our communities
and sharing our elders children
want to grow our children.
All.
Practices if and sent to the.
We we don't want to
commercialize.
Keep it at home the elderly are
we know where we come from you
know our relatives are you know
what generation.
We are as.
Since.
Language speakers preservers
agricultural.
And so on thank you.
And madam chair presenters.
So what I'm hearing here is the.
Where it where it was led to it
it was kind of faded failed.
And and you want to reorganize.
Take take control the situation
because you know there's
something
prove.
And.
I'm glad the the gentleman stood
up and talked about act long ago
because I'm that guy.
We
second largest.
Economic.
To the state of New Mexico
agriculture is real important
and the culture of the Ag is
different within the natives if
we take it back and and and till
today if there someone change
someone's there for.
For our kids to learn.
For the people across this
nation to more.
Because I've heard this
testimony in Indiana Committee
before.
And.
It is very heartwarming and and
to see and understand and I've
never had the opportunity I
guess I'll have to make time for
the opportunity Sunday to attend
the ceremonies I think I think I
would love to see that love to
take my grandkids to.
This is not only good.
For your people.
But it's good for the state of
New Mexico.
We talk about tourism we talk
about how the state can prosper.
And here's something that'll
help the state of New Mexico
prosper and move forward.
With with the tourism.
And and get people to see the
people of this land and and how
it was many generations ago and
that we still exists.
And we're so diversified in New
Mexico.
My people are different than
your people madam chair and
that's great to see that we all
live here together in unity and
harmony.
I wish that we have some of the
Hispano culture stuff goes on.
The other but.
I wish we could have things of
this magnitude in the
Hispanicize is it I would really
I think do the people good and
the kids and see their culture
and history their heritage okay
where they came from.
Madam chair I have no more
questions or comments thank you
for bringing this forward.
Appreciate your time.
Thank you
To
her madam chair thank you very
much and I really appreciate
about a colleague's comments and
we heard about this Indian
Affairs to separate in our in
our interim committee the just
listen to all the date it just
reminds me to spend so way too
many years and I needed to the
ceremony so I need to get shares
that so thank you very much on
stand and support thank you
madam coordinator.
Thank you Representative Senator
right of madam chair and chair
of.
Well the culturally this is the
one in Gallup will you have any
interaction with the ceremony
that they have an Albuquerque at
the tingly Coliseum.
The.
We don't and madam chair and
colleagues we don't necessarily
have interactions I guess the
interaction we would have the
may have approved the new
purchase of blues.
And so that the present
ourselves and we showcase and
participate in that manner and
also are.
Children and elders dancers
artisans will participate.
exposition.
Thank you madam chair thank you
representative Representative
lock thank you madam madam
chair.
By.
I don't know how to do that but.
Thank you so I I appreciate you
bringing this forward to get
some and I'm kicking myself but
I've never been before so I need
to go and the manager really
likes what the testimony said
today about not commercializing
said the two often it does get
commercialized madam chair madam
chair I think a you definitely
need to preserve your culture so
that's super important to me to
and so regarding this bill I see
that there's appropriation for
three hundred thousand dollars I
was wondering madam chair and
then chair if that.
If that's appropriate you know
because I see that you said
thirty eight thousand one
hundred eighty eight people came
this this last year we had nine
hundred and ninety six
participants in the rodeo so I
mean it seems like such a mac
like a huge event is there any
way that we could potentially
help you even more madam chair
madam chair I hate to give away
my position here on the.
just we're scared that for too
much guys
Thank you we would like to do we
like more obviously.
But some of those things people
can get lazy.
They don't want to go out cost.
this keeps us like I said we're
all three hundred thousand last
year that keeps building is all
prior kind of yellow street.
Come on the.
And to dress you think about
tourism I made for one moment Mr
moral thankfully please I'm
sorry.
Right to be brief I'm.
Committee and presenters I'm
just a little worried about the
number of people waiting in the
hall and some of them were older
and we don't have enough chairs
so by all means into the
question but if you can't
exercise Italy France Germany we
did two thousand series magazine
Japan.
A long time to figure out the
most I tell you people four
percent Spanish.
I just couldn't figure out what
they wanted but and I'm not
bilingual lady but we figured it
out.
And it also backed use rock
McKinley County Daniels a member
of the commission out had it not
been for McKinley County
stepping up and taking care of
us left here would have.
I just want to think that left
over with so we can always use
more money if you can right
without somebody thank you madam
chair LESC more going to this
and I just have a few other
quick questions I'll keep it
brief but so turning it from the
department of I believe tourism
to finance how would that change
the commission madam chair and
madam chair.
Briefly that does that that
isn't necessarily change the
commission what it does is
installs board members.
Appointed by the county.
All local workers.
The reason.
Okay thank you madam chair and
thank you so Representative
from.
State.
From our local local
thank you madam chair and thank
you madam chair and my question
was what's the difference
between changing it from an
office association that.
Structured anyway madam chair
and.
Changing the I believe the bill
to the from an office to an
association how would that
change the structure of the
organization madam chair as I
believe that sells our duty to
request for these funds created
for.
In our office staff make it one
formal keep records and you know
just.
This.
Meditation I was C. three the
offices.
Got to.
Thank you madam chair the chair
and I I stand strong support.
If you can and I'm going to
throw into question now
Representative chair it's just
pertain to page four line
fourteen it says.
The county.
Eight members of the appointed
by the county just to clarify
because governors one person
County who actually does the
appointee.
There are four to make
recommendations to the county is
where candid and we have a lot
of support.
they may have.
So differences of what we
suggest.
But we don't have to go through
there.
Line a process we know
here we go again there for your
see we know that I heart you so.
We understand this will make
suggestions.
The.
Awfully.
Right now we need to stay within
the point one.
Representative I think my
question was we're talking about
the county commission correct
and that might be it
clarification considers the bill
for.
because the county isn't a
specific person.
So clarify clarified here thank
you some more for a second
question madam chair I'd like to
make an amendment to the bill.
I think if we added one line at
the last page and promise to
promise us that this one but
Johnson while Paul.
Thank you.
We have a lot of support.
Thank you Representative.
The money.
I think that should be floor of.
Representative three of them
chair of the
second we have a due process
motion from reading and the
second from.
Little.
And is there any opposition to
this motion.
Is there any opposition act
three times is there any
opposition it's saying you have
to do panas unanimous those
thank you madam chair members.
And we have believe it will be
doing some little hole in our as
we.

representative of the committee
my name is my.
And half of.
Nonprofit to seek tribal
consultation policy.
Ation and as well as serving as
Davis board president the space
Senator is also economic
environmental justice.
Representative is organized.
Thank you madam chair so health
no one eighty eight is a
culmination of work that we
started back in twenty nineteen
we started and and I appreciated
Representative someone asks
question from earlier in history
of how we get here because I
think this one have a very long
history
in twenty nineteen at the height
of the debate of a lot of our
climate I'm a bills there was a
community effort under way to
lay out a framework for just
transition across the state of
New Mexico this issue for me is
very important because as
somebody I grew up in lake
Arthur which is ten minutes our
parties up a lot of my family
friends are still very much
directly or indirectly impacted
by the the highs and the lows of
the oil and gas industry and so
this work is is very very
important and so and twenty
nineteen we introduced house
bill five forty seven which
created the workforce clean
energy economy study we were
with the legislation didn't pass
but I was able to commission a
study with your money which will
to team up with the department
of workforce solutions and and
the University of New Mexico
that study which is now what I
just tend to call the D. W. as
clean energy study on page you
all could easily agreeable and
and read through was the really
important piece of information
because
one it started at the at the
darkest days of the pandemic the
the the the focus groups and all
of that we had intended to have
that happened face to face but
unfortunately because of the
pandemic we were unable to do
that but we we but the
University of New Mexico was
able to manage this is a very
successful virtual are using
phones to be able to contact and
and have conversations with you.
Well about what a transition
could look like for their
communities and so that was the
glimmer of hope and and for me
anyway during that time that in
the midst of also oil and gas
collapsing it dropped over three
hundred percent thing on at the
same time.
were impacted a lot of New
Mexicans primarily those living
in rural areas on this study
really did exceed a lot of
expectations for for many of us
are the results of that study
then left the hospital to ninety
seven which was the workforce
and economic prosperity Act
which focus on economic
development this is back in
twenty twenty one and it worked
to create the workforce and
prosperity Council and requiring
the development of the statewide
framework utilizing the results
of the DWS study of that that
whole journey twenty twenty one
was also we have to to do a lot
of education in terms of where
it how it would survive it it
was in implemented into the
climate bill at that point and
at the last minute we decided to
pull it we recognize that there
is a lot of energy behind
focusing on workers and and and
and that's when we felt like it
was really important to move
forward I'm that legislation our
goal with the final bill and
then eventually we introduced it
as a standalone and with the
time running out of the
legislative session of two
ninety seven and we were able to
then incorporate into what now
is a sustainable economy task
force which was eventually
signed into law by the governor
and we have been working with
and and really trying to build
up the framework percent so for
the last two years that task
force in the Advisory Council
have meant a discussed issues
related to economic development
and members of the cation
community based organizations
from across the state have also
been working with frontline
communities and those who are
deeply impacted by natural
resources extraction who have
begun to develop plans of what
life could look like if and when
oil and gas is no longer viable
for if there is a downturn like
we've seen historically on in
many of these communities.
Those ideas have now translated
into health bill one eighty
eight which we are I'm talking
about and discussing today the
bill here today creates the
economic transition division
within the department of
economic development it expands
the membership was stable
economy Advisory Council and
enact the economic transition at
and it asks for ten million
dollars appropriation for a
trust fund to support oil and
gas workers in when they need to
tap into workforce development
grants loans things like that
and so I will hand it off to my
experts at this point to share
more in terms of the mechanisms
within the bill and I will I
will let Michael the.
Representative chair members of
the committee of just a little
bit more back on a powerful
Mexico.
It is a statewide coalition
represents indigenous immigrant
worker and community based
organizations state including
the San Juan Hernandez number of
our leaders are present here
this morning and that would be
appropriate to ask them to stand
the reference sure so many.
Gold for these issues receive.
Yes.
Thank you thank you much thank
you all.
Chair members of thank you very
much for your consideration
house bill one eighty eight
economic transition at.
The bill addresses a number of
issues confronting the state
today first we need to diversify
our economy listen on fossil
fuel revenues.
According according to a recent
for PFM group the peak in oil
and gas production New Mexico
could potentially call within
the next.
Second is the drive to
transition to a clean energy
economy.
In twenty eighteen the New
Mexico legislature passed energy
transition that was sent to
renewable energy standard fifty
percent for investor owned
utilities rural electric
cooperatives by twenty thirty
the goal of eighty percent
twenty.
Third is the need to support and
protect workers and communities
through these major economic
transitions other volatility of
natural resource extraction
industries we make need to make
sure that these communities and
workers don't get left behind in
the process force is the store
divestment from committee
depending on natural resource
extraction workers and their
families in the Permian basin
for farmers should not be
lackadaisical perception
Services as they often do a huge
contributions they're making to
the states.
In fifth is a need to bring in
as many resources as possible to
advance the state's workforce
transition strategies New Mexico
has the opportunity right now to
bring in millions of dollars
resources from the federal
legislation.
The state has a number of good
programs and policies that can
help to address these issues and
we provided a list of some of
these relevant programs and
materials we sent earlier two of
the most pressing need to the
general fund in our
conversations with state
agencies community leaders
impacted workers our first
federal one nation state
programs and seconded.
In particular fifty funding to
give agencies flexibility to
support workers and community
based on the this is a long term
process that requires deep
relief and long term investments
in social and physical
infrastructure economic and
workforce development and safety
nets.
H. B. one eighty eight would
establish a new division within
the Mexico economic development
projects as Representative Rubio
said.
Division will provide much
needed administrative and
programmatic support sustainable
con Task Force and sustainable
economy by a committee
established in twenty twenty one
it would expand the sustainable
economy advisory committee to
include worker organizations
representatives of higher
education workforce development
and prevention programs and
service work with the task force
and advisory.
Both comprehensive strategy
coordinate with existing state
programs and identify gaps in
use for.
The bill would also establish
economic transition fund to
support the relief and long term
investments needed to help
families to the transition like
childcare income support will be
trained for the jobs expanded
employment wage differential
support and more.
The fund is meant to be over the
long term.
Because this economic transition
state years doesn't mean we
gave a lot of writing State.
It would also serve as a vehicle
to read receive and distribute
federal funding that will now be
available the solution reduction
at bipartisan infrastructure law
little programs for community
economic development and job
creation disproportionately
impacted communities.
The fund to provide matching
grants and technical assistance
to communities to help them
overcome barriers to receive
federal funds HUAC a full health
is to address the serious that
federal policy does not allow us
to stand needed services to
undocumented workers who make up
roughly half of oil and gas
workforce.
House bill one eighty eight will
build upon the energy transition
act twenty nineteen expanding
the scope of eligible workers
and communities to other regions
dependent on natural resource
extraction.
So we're requesting one million
dollars for staffing startup
costs with version two point
five million dollars to the
state of task forces the state
will come by the committee to
support their work and community
engagement efforts and ten
million dollars to initiate
transaction.
You will also see in order to
hear that we've identified
opportunities Representative
programs inflation reduction
activities I.
I regret greatly appreciate your
support.

all because of the lack of
training and safety standards I
had to leave my job for more
than three months and I had to
find other jobs to do to be able
to survive with my family and so
I was able to feel and and go
back to Saint industry because
my access to give me time to
recuperate that they want to
return and I could not do so I
could not get into North
compensation that's what is very
important that we are the only
has workers since we are in an
industry that is earning money
for somebody orders we are
risking our lives every day in
industry and still not get
value.
The owners are really good at
charging money for for the work
that we do for them I live in
New Mexico I don't and they
don't want to pay even though
he's been around for a Lujan
that that happens it's unfair

were displaced who lost their
homes and loss of livelihoods we
watch as we helplessly see drugs
deepening and lengthening and
face terrifying wildfire threats

Okay Andreas stranding
stranding.
And director.
Andrea Andrea straddling.
Yes I am from Farmington and
thank you for allowing me to
share of the continued
ridiculous management of energy
in America will only continue to
increase the cost of the
consumer always demonizing the
industry driving capital away
from investments increasing
regulatory costs and trying to
do regulate the schedule on
industry death with the green
new deal will only reduce
production reduce inventories
and drive prices up as we have
seen it is ludicrous for the
government to restrict
exploration talk companies to
increase production higher
prices and limited supply
following chair New Mexico
families deserve so much more
reliant medical group in urgent
care provide occupational
medical services to the to
multiple energy agencies and
companies these closures kids
jobs as we have seen with PNM
and someone generating station
and the that how money.
Our clients lose employees we
lose customers and we lose
Forty employees that are it will
be affected and I'm also
involved in the schools in the
region and we need to invest in
jobs that will help us care for
our families not destroy them
our four children are raising
their families and our eleven
grandchildren all their live
here except now due to different
problems with the employment
market I have your time.
But sleeping thank you for your
time.
Thank you as we have Larry we
lay half.
Yes.
My name is Larry Lee health and
climate change isn't anything
new it's always happened in the
engine passed.
And happening now it'll happen
in the future even if people
aren't even here it'll still
happen because the sun is what's
driving the claim not it's not
anthropomorphic is not.
You may.
The World Economic Forum is
behind all these people.
To talk about climate change and
the the only thing that really
that will help
our economy is to keep the oil
and gas industry going the wind
turbines solar panels produce
toxic waste or even worse than
gas and oil.
And in the long run they don't
produce enough energy.
to sustain anyone.
So.
That's the trade off.
Anyway that's that's all thank
you thank you next we have
Alexis Martinez Johnson.
Good morning madam chair and
legislators my name is Alexis
Martinez Johnson one of yes I
can't can't is that we do a
reality check we've heard many
activists and whatnot come on
let's also remember that oil and
natural gas industry is vital to
New Mexico is vital for energy
security not sure if you all are
aware I'm an engineer but I
wanted to tell you that Mexico
is producing more crude the and
then the entire country of
Mexico right now it's important
to keep our lights on know
what's going to happen when we
don't have the lights on are you
do you want to go out and burn
what which is very detrimental
to the environment so let's all
keep in mind a reality check it
provides vast economic benefits
to provide every single thing
that you guys are doing all of
our teachers all of our children
all of the lunches that we

Thank you any further comments
from the public in support of
the bill Madam were open to
question.
Okay committee members.
Representative right.
Thank you madam chair.
In the
members of.
Chair representative there's
testimony that you see in the
future of the oil and gas
industry if you will would be
shut down I would like to know
what time line you said that is.
Thank you madam chair.
So there are there have been
reports that
that that meant for speaking ill
on that
that the industry will see a
complete decline at at some
point in the next ten years
what we want to address here is
not only just the future
challenges that will face with
that but also
as we mentioned March twenty
twenty there was a decline three
hundred percent in oil and gas
this legislation is really to
also think through the of all
the tile is that is the industry
that we are able to address that
in terms of specifics all handed
to Michael on on that timeline
that you're asking.
Think of.
We.
My testimony talked about PFM
group which
Basically took a look at what
the economic projections of
financial projections would be
of the the peak in oil
production and they're
projecting it could be as early
as next to Kate we see those
declines and as a Representative
Rubio says.
Chairman of the committee of the
the the volatility of the
industry it is most auto
industry we have in the state.
We understand that nobody's
denying the contribution
financially economically in this
industry over time that is very
volatile addition to major
cycles just within the last five
to ten years so so it's a we we
also want to account for to make
sure committees.
Thank you madam chair and an
expert I do agree that it goes
up and down and we do need to
the
us kind of card is that Madam
chair
of Representative Rubio let's go
to page four and one four we
talk about forty representatives
of such suggestion of for you to
you get those individuals from
different areas state I think
you are the the on that but you
know of.
Madam chair representative
review I do have a proposed
amendment was go to page seven.
Analysts go to one twelve and
when we look at that that.
I agree to the extraction
industry and in particular the
northwest part of the state you
know if you look at uranium coal
mining and all those happen but
I think you need to add in one
of the group
the preferred that there were
six there's six different power
plants there were closed UNM so
all the employees of that of
those power.
So one sixteen after industry.
I would propose.
For.
The closing of.
And all like right our plan.
And like to know if that serve
from the amendment.
Thank you thank you thank you
madam chair of Representative
what but we were just discussing
is again thank you for for that
proposal
It makes sense to.
Yes.
Yeah I think that's the the from
the amendment in terms of adding
it to the definition for
commuting transition.
Of the thank you madam chair
anyway I would make that motion
give us a more friendly in our
one.
I just have a question on the
amendment.
K. so we're discussing the
minutes of this time.
Correct so of.
Representative.
Madam chair representative.
Two one electric for just
powerful.
What is the flu stream flows
not.
Mexico City Mexico.
Yes
Madam chair
Representative Chasey I thought
about power plant but I I didn't
know if it was specific enough
of so I am an open reserve one
and we're trying to get to the
same one state of New.
I don't know if we need teachers
our plans four point three to be
more specific.
So just.
The size and I'm not the expert
harmful.
But we want we want to make sure
that that's exactly how I.
And Madam chair representative
and I just I want to introduce
representative of this nation's
also sponsor on the bill
We're we're happy I've I've
talked to folks on in in terms
of the community transition we
could add a generic closing of
power plants because that would
apply to to every everything.
Madam chair I have no problem in
the money.
Okay.
And then and then I think
Madam chair representative you
need to make the same change on
page nine fine.
I.
Madam I share the funding others
I've tried to do a quick look
and I thought.
I did not see.
It is the only thought of others
off of the Sanchez.
Chair right well others with the
definition needs to be updated
on that point Representative
lawsuit page six.
Nine fifteen.
Sixteen fifty fifty.
Research expects.
More.
Yes.
Thank.
you madam chair representatives
just just a heads up that any
money in the bill that there's
any discussion about community
transition it'll automatically
whatever amendment we make
should fly any other time that
community transition is an and
we we also just have notice that
so to speak so that it's it's
consistent with statue already
when it comes to issues like
this that it's best to
keep in as of a generation
facility verses power plant.
Madam chair Fund
it's a general rage.
Our.
What project so
that.
Says access
to.
For the next three hundred
fifty.
Yeah.
But.
Thanks.
So.
Okay thank you madam chair to
Representative Rubio yes okay no
it and I'm glad that is firmly
in the trying to address that
thank you.
I got a job.
I have a motion to.
Friendly amendment or would you
like to fix this before the next
committee I think it's part of
the amendment so mentor my
question is do we decide to go
back to just making the
amendment one time on page seven
and so the amendment I believe
there is that anytime there is
mention of community in
transition we would add electric
generating facilities
into okay.
HM.
Okay so we have a motion to
adopt them and.
Is there objection.
Thank you madam chair.
C..
Madam chair and Representative
Rubio if we go to page state and
wanted to
be a insurers health and safety
standards fossil fuel any
emerging industry I'm just
trying to figure out what that
means is are you is are you
gonna be come regulators now or
what what is the meaning of
that.
You madam chair representative
all handed over to my.
Madam chair representative
worrying now
Can answer your question from
the public regulators is
promoting Act the enforcement of
current OSHA standards both in
current industry and also gave
the emergency industry and it is
state.
The reason why that is still in
there is because right now there
are very lax enforcement
relaxing forces.
Of safety protocols that we've
seen in because some folks.
In the industry alright.
Offices are often afraid to come
forward and report those sounded
pretty today but we just want to
make sure that employers may
there is a promotion and then of
course.
Madam chair in thanks for I'm
trying to figure out how you're
going on the if you're not a
regular how you're going to do
the enforcement arm of the.
Madam chair representative Ramon
C. Environment Department which
oversees OSHA.
Is a part of the sustainable
economy task force and so there
is.
Agency that participates force
of the standards that is part of
the sustainable task force that
will be part of the economic
transitions.
Of thank you madam chair and
madam chair and representative.
When we go to page eight we
don't want twenty one this is
white point to lose work.
I feel that is so loose the.
Thank I mean I can go ahead and
say I'm likely to lose work in
the future as well.
Yet only the kind of things that
needs to be tightened up and I'm
not sure about you know
Go ahead and Madam chair
representative the the reason
that we we've added that
language has been mostly because
of the historical issues that
we've seen with natural resource
extraction particularly within
the oil and gas industry that
when we're talking about workers
for example who don't
necessarily equal who don't
qualify for unemployment
benefits
they're likely to lose work in
these industries more often than
any other.
Madam chair representative
overview of what we what we say
it another way.
I'm a wide please to lose work
and I you just simply because of
my age okay so what I'm trying
to do is say I think you need to
put some time on it or some tied
to something and I don't have
the language for that I I think
that it is just I think almost
all of us could make.
Madam chair representative
that's a great point and we can
definitely take that into
consideration.
Madam chair representative group
thank you that's all my
questions thank you.
Thank Representative Chasey.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you Representative Rubio no one
of the folks who testified in
favor of the.
Bill talk about a true safety
standards.
what I'm wondering.
Also.
Of having been injured so.
Do I understand that perhaps
some of these individuals
because they are not U. S.
citizens are not entitled to
workers have or
Unemployment is that is on the
issue Madam chair representative
chair representative that's
absolutely correct.
Yeah Madam chair representative
industry relying these workers.
Industry needs is workers
because they can't get enough
workers otherwise chair
representative yes as mentioned
earlier in our intro almost
close to fifty percent of the
workers in in the oil and gas
industry who are undocumented
for our immigrants you madam
chair they don't hold green
cards
Madam chair representative I
don't know the the number of
that exact number but I think
one of the most important thing
is that
Cool I think within a is a
system in which we find
ourselves when we're working in
institutions like the oil and
gas industry a lot of times full
full goal along without actually
reporting on any injuries and
things like that for fear of I
mean this will be based on fear
and so
it and that comes from both
people who have government
station and and people don't
have documentation so it's very
much of Madam a common thing.
Madam chairman Representative
Rubio Representative Ortez I.
I I do support and that's an
issue we're going on twenty
years now since president George
W. bush tried to get
comprehensive immigration reform
it is just such a failure that
constantly that we don't have it
in here for for agricultural
system needs to have workers
coming in the ability to work
for
Working for field work that
there are not enough people.
Who are already residents of
this state to do and
Is this just it's really a
travesty that we have not done
this at the federal level it
really is is what what I think
is a shame is that instead of
trying to craft a solution that
makes sense it has become a
political football it's just
terrible and.
Maybe it doesn't make any sense
for our overall economy.
Because of these workers are
contributing to the growth of
our our country thank you madam
chair.
Thank you Representative
resident Representative block
thank you madam chair and thank
the representatives and vice
chair of the path it's good to
see you all here today I just
had a few questions here I'm
working on page seven you would
definition disproportionately
impacted communities.
And then I believe on line it
also has a nother definition
that appears that
disproportionately impacted
community and I know the
different sections of it that
way it's repeated or.
Chair representative.
Madam chair representative so I
believe that page seven
definition is from what was
already in statute.
it's it's related to the
economic transition division
itself and then page line is for
new material for the definition
start to the beginning.
Okay thank you madam chair thank
you representatives that that up
for me a little bit and then
going into this definition of
that disproportionately affect
community I see the it says when
we come rural communities and
native people but it also says
in that same sentence the people
of color and I would just ask
what is the difference between
what I need people are people of
color so I'm wondering why it is
repeated madam chair
representative so I'm Madam
chair representative
I mean I I think it's to include
people that are the
representative communities of
color outside of I needed to
communities
Because they are their own
people.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative and I I agree
they are their own people just
want to make sure that
everybody's included in here.
So regarding the individuals
that would be affected by this
if they lost their job what if
that individual I didn't fall
into this particular definitions
such as a let's just say a white
working for and to do their job
are the included in this
definition madam chair
representative chair
representative yes they are
included.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative so going forward
here I think the appropriation
in FY are.
It says the around twelve
thirteen million Madam chair
representative I want to wonder
if systems recurring raise one
time twelve million and then the
eight hundred thousand.
We at one time.
Okay thank you madam chair thank
you eight hundred the eight
hundred thousand in recurring
ask for the division itself but
everything else is is one.
Okay thank you madam chair thank
you Representative so then I see
here in this analysis that we've
it's the F. I. R. and it talks
about how the state has a
division of.
I wrote it down here because I
would have forgotten.
This call.
Under the the justice equity
diversity and inclusion office
and the EDD so that department
says that.
This could potentially be
duplicating the work of the EDD
with the.
Diversity and inclusion office
how would this be different that
madam chair representative Madam
chair representative thank you
for the question so
that is solely an office within
a major department for for
this particular bill I believe
that it's much more aspirational
I feel that this is the a
division that needs to be
prioritized not only because it
is important for economic
development but it also means
that the the state and the
legislature is prioritizing
community from my communities I
don't want it to just be an
office that's sort of just set
aside within a department this
is actually a very meaningful
division that
that will I believe provide a
lot of different opportunities
for frontline communities but
that will expand to really Sir
Senator what we're all trying to
accomplish at a statewide level
thank you madam chair thank you
Representative so would you
think it would be prudent to
maybe disband this office of
justice equity diversity
inclusion to be under your new
Councillor Department Madam
chair representative I don't
believe so so I just wanted to
be very clear that that this
legislation is very very broad
our communities are not
monolithic we are very much
Representative this this
legislation is is here to
represent all communities
genocide which is what is
considered the office and is
that your described that you're
talking about that those are the
that that's the acronym
for any Star Wars fans.
In that.
Jeff participate we work to
address issues related to
black indigenous communities of
color within the issues that the
department is is dealing with
this for us is much broader and
more specific to
us beyond just.
Of.
Yeah.
Thank you madam chair com and
and Madam chair representative
also let Michael.
Hello.
Chair representative yes really
appreciate because we've been
looking at all these questions
as well in terms of current
existing functions and programs
not just the the.
Part of the workforce solutions
reciprocation higher education
and one of the points that the
current thing that kept coming
up was out better coordination
amongst all these programs and
agencies for secretary he said
there's a lot of passion on this
bill would actually do the work
and so
a big function of this division
would actually be to coordinate
generated similar to all these
different programs and that uses
force analogy here but we have
point.
Is basically helping all of
these different agencies and
programs.
Performance just and so this is
the to do an assessment terms of
what's currently being done
across the board our reserves
how do we concentrate those
efforts resources.
It is.
This and you can just ask really
quickly to that I think that's
the beauty of what the
sustainable economy task force
was in the beginning is because
we included so many members from
each agency to participate in
the task force because we
believe that this is an issue
that should be silo just one
department it should be very
much
a collective process within all
departments within the the state
agencies thank you madam chair
and thank you Representative and
that thanks for the question
answered and so I see in the FIR
as well I love these FY and.
But so I see that needs to be a
twenty eight relates to house
the one eighty six and two that
they create office of
entrepreneurship with economic
development department so that
would be under the around the
area that you're trying to.
With these two bills I don't
know if it's in perfect question
two bills with with your
legislative Madam chair
representative thank you for the
question I don't believe that it
will interfere and.
I want to say that based on just
the history that I presented
earlier around how we got here
and and how much of this comes
from community themselves I
think the other legislation
which I I absolutely respect the
sponsors for bringing forward a
lot they are I think are to top
down ideas that we're trying to
come up with with ways in which
we can enrich our communities
except that a lot of what you
recommend that I believe that
communities are that need are
are brought forth by themselves
and that's that laid out here in
this legislation thank you madam
chair the Representative yeah so
this would be very autonomous
and it would really get complete
this other pieces so that's
that's good I think that's
important and I think it would
at actually it adds to those
pieces of legislation okay thank
you madam chair and thank you
Representative and so I'm seeing
this technical issues in the
news and economic development
they say that the money
appropriated with the new
economic transition plan is not
appropriate to the Department
they say that would necessitate
annual legislative
appropriations so they worry
that without authority to expand
funds that the annual
legislative sessions it would be
difficult to administer the
funds to the industry that need
in a timely fashion icon FY are
on page.
Five or six four so I just wanna
make sure with this her.
Getting annual recurring funds
madam chair representative Madam
chair representative thank you I
don't believe that it will I
think that what we're what we're
proposing is something that's
just not traditional it's not
done but it it's not something
that can't happen it just
requires just a little bit more
what's the word I'm trying to
remember the work that they use
but it's
Hey I lost actually one of my
nose so my apologies but that's
where that one word live.
But forget something.
There is a process there is a
mechanism that exists that we
can utilize that it just isn't
something we do traditional but
it's not something that.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you Representative I appreciate
that and hopefully we can find
that lost all all.
Thank you madam chair and so
with this a new task force chair
it says
That it would try to get federal
funds to help these communities
so currently I mean I guess
currently from what it has been
passed to Congress right now
what is the.
All I guess monetarily like what
number of dollars are you
looking to extract the federal
government Madam chair
representative I'm Madam chair
representative that's a great
question so there is quite a bit
of federal funds that
are available to
To this effort there is the
infrastructure bill that was
passed by Congress that would
bring I think it's like three
million dollars and then there's
the other base package that also
included some more millions of
dollars I think once even more
important about this division is
that and this is something that
we have also addressed with
issues related to connectivity
for example with broadband which
represented be at all and I
worked on is that a lot of local
communities particularly rural
communities don't have capacity
to do grant writing for a number
of different programs that are
at the federal level this
division would actually provide
that type of support to local
communities so that when there
is a grant related to workforce
development program that is
related to maybe supporting all
of an individual in a local of a
type of
a different type of job that
this division would be able to
support them and that and that
way those are the types of
federal funds that exists that
are in the millions of dollars
and we definitely and I think
it's in your packet that we
might have given provided you
all a list of what some of those
things those items might have
been but
there's there's a lot of money
out there for these types of
specific ideas that that we're
proposing to.
I'm sure and I can Madam chair
representative all.
Yes
The madam chair representative
yes goal you asked what was the
number.
In the first year of this
process the division would work
with the sustainable economy
task force and the Advisory
Council to do.
Conduct an action develop
actually.
that action plan to.
developed a cost projection
what it's really going to cost
for the long term because this
this is going to be enough forty
million dollars wasn't enough
for the energy transition.
so we really need to know what
those numbers are how many
people you're talking about what
kind of benefits within the time
what kind of investments in
terms of supporting development
workforce development education
all so that's the intent is for
us to to really find out what we
don't really know at this point
figure out what the actual this
okay thank you madam chair and
thank you Representative.
We just brought up a few more
questions for me I apologize to.
madam chair representative so
this action plan I see in the
the analysis that I have it
looks like the.
One of these departments that
you all ask for information for
they said that the timeline on
the bill could be done by think
it's twenty twenty four they
said that that would be
impossible I believe EDD says.
Is it impossible and the if is
there a way that we could
potentially tip that a little
ways in the future maybe six
months to make sure they have
the time to put that together
chair representative Madam chair
representative yes that's
definitely something that we can
discuss with the department on
moving forward we are in
discussions still in relations
to the appropriation so that is
definitely something that we can
bring up we we actually right
that it probably around six.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative so and then going
back to my first my questions
for regarding the funding and
how much we would need so I see
here is the city of Farmington
they had a they had a five
percent ownership stake in the
General land from San Juan
generating station and its that
seventy million dollars is what
they would lose from closer to
as well as the loss of four
hundred fifty jobs so you know I
see seventy million a lot of
money and that's just one plant
I'm wondering what like what
would we need if we were
supposed to transition totally
in the next I think it's ten
years twenty thirty five is what
we're looking for zero zero so I
mean I'm guessing it would be
billions of dollars to the
federal government would be
amicable to such a large
appropriation that we would need
Madam chair representative Madam
chair representative.
I mean part of why the
sustainable economy task force
is so important and the
mechanisms within this bill are
important is because there the
report that you just talked
about that would provide an
initial idea of what the next
decade could look like for us
we do have ability we have
billions of dollars in our in
our revenues right now and we we
in anticipate that there will be
continued
revenues throughout the next I
think forty five years that
I think the legislature house to
make some really big decisions
about providing for frontline
communities in preparation for
that but also the federal
government has to step in and
and thank you.
The same as well and I think
part of the comprehensive plan
that is part of this this this
legislation will help to
provide us the information that
we need moving forward I wish I
could tell you how much that
number is
but but my hope is that by
twenty twenty four when a lot of
this reporting is is do that we
will we will have a very good
idea of that.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you for I don't know if you're
experts have any comments on
that.
I.
From Saint Peter's.
Representative so then talking
about the ETA which this would
build on can you just give me
some of the things that the ETA.
Last I guess in its current form
and that's why we need this task
force Madam chair
representative.
Madam chair representative
so that is I think a very
important question is that this
legislation doesn't replace the
TA what it does is it fills gaps
that the TA wasn't and haven't
been able to fill I think one of
the biggest things is that a lot
of the supports the financial
support that is necessary to be
released almost immediately is
to the folks in the communities
that live in the northwestern
part of the state this
legislation would allow for
funding to get to them almost
immediately whereas
of communities in the Permian
basin basin that's much longer
that is a much more a long term
process but at the what this
legislation does it is the
difference to the team that
actually gets signing off
Twitter to folks in the
northwest part of the state
thank you madam chair thank you
Representative so it would
complement the ETA is that what
I'm getting from the.
And we did find your forms the
economic transition act and the
energy transition act compares
so you'll still see sort of the
purposes there there's a purpose
for each one of them the
beneficiaries time frames the
funds
I think what's really what life
might the the piece that's more
important to me and I wish we
would have asked for more money
on on this was the transition
fund because the transition fund
is the most important piece
that's different from the T.
April twenty nineteen is that we
have a fund that is available to
local communities that will be
there
for as long as as we allow it to
be.
Okay and my hope is that we can
continue to fund it even more
in the future sessions okay
thank you madam chair and thank
you Representative so what do
you think we could figure might
be versus fund I know that you
said you dollars.
But yeah I mean Madam chair
representative I wish I could
tell you the amount of money but
I think there's enough stories
and share to you all today to to
illustrate that there is an
absolute movie there's a long
legacy of communities who have
had to take the brunt of
of of of while the the the state
has thrived economically and
financially through revenues
because of these industries are
communities that have been
that's been done on the backs
communities and so I can't I
don't even think a trillion
dollars could even
really impact what has been done
to communities I don't think
that there is a number and I
think we'll debate that number
for many years to come but my
hope is that this legislation
could at least be the starting
point to having that
conversation that is both
intentional and and necessary
thank you madam chair and thank
you Representative so we're
talking about the people that
are impacted by but it's
extracted in the industry and
you know we heard stories and
you know it's hard finding here
something that happened these
individuals like the gentleman's
hands getting getting to and
that's just really scary so does
OSHA at the federal level does
that.
Does that work alongside that we
have in the state to ensure that
people that are both citizens
and noncitizens are being
protected madam chair and how
with this task force ensure
their security while they
continue to work in these
different places Madam chair
representative Madam chair
representative all often says.
Representative thank you again
for question so I'm sure that we
have a New Mexico should
departments that is tasked with
on a complaint based system and
also in proactive ways insurance
policies chapters of folks not
just this industry hospice for
their after the New Mexico
elements for the single currency
department which is part of the
sustainable economy task force
and so.
In the process of putting this
all together with all of the
different community groups that
are most impacted if there.
There was a need it was clear
there was a need to protect
people now other office jobs to
make sure that as emerging
industry.
Are created has that you don't
see some of the same problems
and lacks.
In lax safety protocols and
lacks training program calls in
other industries and so the New
Mexico environment department's
participation in this broader
efforts through the stable
property task force will be
absolutely necessary.
Stay alive and are able to work
if you were to get districts as
the thank you madam chair and
thank you Representative so on
that talking about that point
with the department department
so we sort of complaint based
with this Task Force continue to
make it complaint based madam
chair representative.
Previous efforts chair
representative Madam chair
representative locked okay.
Yeah it would not this task this
division that was a stable
company task force is not at
this point changing there's no
at this point there's no
contemplation changing currents
enforcement mechanisms it's a
matter of all of the issues
making sure that we're promoting
our nation about workers rights
in this process that also ocean
also works with industry to make
sure that industry is aware of
the different safety protocols
complaint base but also provides
need to work across the board to
help everyone right here
standards for workers in the
industry thank you madam chair
thank you Representative I just
ask that question because I know
that certain communities are
hesitant to file a complaint
with the government you know and
I I know for many years
government has done a lot of
terrible things and I I just
wouldn't want to put a stumbling
block in front of folks from
getting the care and the help
they need if they are damaged by
what was happening in their
industry so I guess comment I
would make would maybe maybe
look at making it a little
easier for these individuals to
yes anonymous or.
Discreet as possible Madam chair
representative.
Thank you and
Look at one hundred more
questions broadcast on.
The another question I have for
you was regarding tribal
governments Madam chair
representative you know I know
that we cannot regulate tribal
nations so how are we working
with the Navajo Nation and other
neighboring states such as Utah
Texas Arizona and Colorado to
make sure that they are also
going the same direction as we
are madam chair regarding
getting these workers protected
Madam chair representative Madam
chair representative of part of
the it does a stable economy
task force includes communities
that represent those communities
and so they that's why we needed
them okay thank you madam chair
and thank you Representative
that would include people from
those outside the state such as
the Navajo Nation it goes all
the way to Arizona and Utah what
we get folks from those
communities as well if they are
impacted by Senator
Madam chair representative for
no they would be all New
Mexicans okay thank you madam
chair representative yeah I
would love for you guys to
coordinate if possible I don't
know maybe an ad hoc basis with
these individuals that might be
useful so that's all the
questions I had chair

frustrate or prevent certain
qualified electors from

compromising sensible security
and administrative practices it
gives New Mexico voters more

Good morning madam chair members
my name is siki McCarty I am
a concerned citizen from PTA's
county as well as the state
director for conservative for
America.
And I am here because I care
deeply about election integrity
and that my folks and the vote
of all eligible New Mexico
voters is protected I oppose H.
B. four
the voting rights protection
businesses leading and
legislation would do the
opposite.
Voter registration provisions in
this deal our problem in so many
ways primarily that someone
interacts with the state agency
would be registered to vote
without their knowledge or
consent.
They are supposed to get a card
telling them that they were
registered it should opt out.
So what we're doing is we.
Crazy because thank you Mr Carty
time.
Madam chair committee my name is
remarkable speaking I'm from Rio
Rancho and I'm here in
opposition of this bill I am a
decline of state I'm in.
Part of the twenty five percent
of this state that chooses not
complied with political parties
but there again we get
discriminated against we ask for
voter rolls they want to limit
the rules why why that's my
question it's okay for the
secretary of state said provided
over rules for third party
vendors Iraq for nonprofits such
as rock with the and then
political parties but the voters
are left out of this why are we
going to be required to have
broke over drop losses when you
already have the United States
postal service that's the
largest drop offs in the country
is not a species already.
There's no way to monitor these
drop boxes in small communities
and our state is role if you
have to really take paid
attention to that thank you
ma'am time.
Madam chair members of the
committee on Carlos on
taxadvantaged better together
New Mexico there are thousands
of New Mexicans that oppose this
bill there's very horrible parts
of this bill when you talk about
automatic voter registration if
you look specifically at page
fifteen paragraph one they are
in the meeting in the state The
in the bill that they understand
that they could be registering
people that are not legal U. S.
is.
Then they're going to send them
a postcard and allow them to opt
out that is absolutely wrong
people want the right to vote
they should go register.
It shouldn't be mandated and it
shouldn't be automatic the same
with the fellas we're all about
second chances a nation.
Manage their sentence to society
and then determine if they want
to vote not be registered and
not be allowed as this bill says
where they will be built near.
This is just all kinds of long
violates our constitution.
Right.
Thank you Mr.
Past.
I am concerned stated that and I
have posted this bill here.
After the voter is required each
county court to making rather is
that over there has to be
updated funds right.
The current photo funds so that
that'd be
that'd Papen seventy thousand.
The move in but only if you know
how he felt about there are no
we plan on permitting activities

I went to school for a time in
Washington state where there is
a total mailings out system and
that has been extremely popular
across the political spectrum

the issue of the mandatory to
ballot boxes our county is
considered a remote County I
have a voter base and my County
twenty five hundred voters right
now I have one box sitting
outside of my administration
building in the last election
cycle I took in a total of
sixteen thousand that box which
we go with the mandatory two
boxes I would actually need to
request to our boxes so that I
don't disenfranchise either the
voters in the north portion of
my County or the south portion
of my County if I put into our
boxes that box up north will be
servicing approximately four
hundred donors if I put the box
down south it will be servicing
approximately eighty two voters
I don't see where that is a good
use of taxpayer dollars in
addition my office only has a
staff of three including the I
am a working clerk if we put in
those additional boxes somebody
would be out of my office.

Hello.

concerned citizen and that it
took me over ten years of hard
work in my U. S. citizenship
right vote so I'm here to speak
strongly oppose it very
for it to be for and nothing to
do this for ten minutes on a
single device I disenfranchised
are wise is to potential Mexico

we're gonna hear everybody's
here to speak today because they
will not be more testimony on
Wednesday.
So I'm gonna strategy.
Madam chair yes thank you very
much can you hear me alright yes
we can okay requiring a photo ID
to vote is a commonsense
safeguards that enjoys broad
support calling found that
eighty percent of voters favor
requiring a photo ID to vote
they're very common in our
society boarding a plane
receiving government benefits
opening a bank account and
purchasing over the counter
drugs so a simple secure
solution to safe and secure of
voting would be to vote in
person and have an ID at the
polls and the transit narrative
is that they don't work as
Georgia in their twenty twenty
election saw that they had a
particularly on the record
turnout in their general
election and especially among
minority communities and
hearings held during the
committee last ministration
commuting last year.
So one of the witnesses
identified
as.
Mr Pablo Martinez.
Okay there and items Pablo
Martinez I'm a member of the
Zuni pueblo native American born
raised here in Gallup Mexico
good morning madam chair and
committee members I oppose this
bill I highly oppose this bill
because of many many reasons one
of them being the lack of
transparency when it comes the
data voter data the CVR data
cast vote records because I know
what that is I had a look at
what it what it is and maybe
actually look at what it'll show
the very bland boring data so
that it is that you cannot do
very much with we need access to
this data to take away from us
the people which we only stayed
actually this produced on
electronic equipment that is
owned by us and by
elected officials that we pay
their salaries for the data is
ours and it should not be
A restricted like it's going to
be with this bill and also it's
it's it's kind of funny to see
all the people who are in favor
this bill they're getting paid
to talk everyone who's close to
the top it is okay Sir thank you
and I want to remind public
testimony this week do not
attack other folks were giving
public testimony moving on to a
poll.
Mr.
Open hearing we can hear you.
So are I'm against age before
you know there's there's too
many things in here that are
that are and open doors for
of election fraud they they're
written with the intention of
sounding like they're enhancing
convenience but the mocs
preserving democracy is not the
same as increasing convenience
so I don't I'm against it and I
think that you know people who
are disabled have enough other
means of of voting like an
absentee ballot so
thank you for your time I'm
against this.
Thank you Mr Olson Annette yes
the.
Chair and members of the
committee my name is that to
steal and I just want to point
out the fact that the post
office is the hugest mailbox
drop box that we have so to add
other drop boxes around
communities school areas it
really doesn't make sense when
we have postal workers who no
ballots as well it just
decreases our security and our
locations which are privileges
and they're not rates they are
privileged to.
the ability to go and we should
treat it as that and honor it
one day of voting date with
paper ballots and new machines
and it and have it have it be a
holiday and celebrated
and not make it convenient for
the kids who are going to tamper
with our elections and have us
elected officials elected and
that's what risk we're seeing
now so thank you so much for
your time.
Thank you Alexis marquise
Johnson thank you for your
patience.
One LCS the act eight thank you
everyone I am in opposition to
this bill as it is right now
specifically on your page twenty
three line seventeen the Human
Services Department still
develop procedures to be
approval secretary state to
ensure each benefit program
administered by the tart
Department
you know lets them know that
they need to vote I think that
this is targeting its redundancy
pressure I need to be very
careful that we're not engaging
electioneering doing that they
already have an ID for getting
services nothing should target
that so this current state I do
not support however I do support
first nation voting Hispanic and
everyone else in New Mexico to
vote thank you thank you Sam.
Can you hear me we can barely
please speak loudly.
Okay sorry that better.
Thank you hi I am opposed to
this bill for the reasons that
people have spoken about but
specifically I am very concerned
about the expanded I automatic
registration two other
agencies.
I I think that the the current
automatic voter registration are
already vulnerable to fraud and
or abuse and the expansion would
make it worse I also believe
that it's kantele invasion of
people's privacy.
but what is particularly
troubling about the the section
that talks about that is it
states that have I'm qualified
voters automatically registered
and then goes ahead and both to
legally the unqualified elector
will not be charged with false
voting because they did
knowingly or willingly
registered to vote so that set
up that's a nice little
workaround they noting this time
Mr Richard right now.
Yes.
Thank you madam chair members my
name is Richard Reynolds Los
crucis I urge you to vote no on
H. B. for voting rights
protections and I have a minute
for you at first background I
was a seasonal many who attended
Dona ana county commission
meetings during twenty twenty
two many of us self described
John F. Kennedy Democrats more
requests every time we appeared
was to advocate for commonsense
reforms such as well ready for
in person it glaring problem and
deficiency in New Mexico
election law.
Destruction parked full
resolution seven four percent of
whites sixty nine percent of
blacks and other minorities
eighty two percent staplers
should be required to show photo
ID to address these issues
reason then this bill Leslie
begin by simply cutting and
pasting HB one ten the questions
the bill which require order I
do by Representative block and
Duncan and place it thank you
for that is time there eight
years they have.
Yes
I'm against H. B. four of four.
The reason for the mention of
the problem and there's no you
no one can up.
What could present a voter ID to
identify themselves and it's a
it's a driver's licenses Wirth I
mean it's the worst thing is
better than nothing because of
the tremendous amount of illegal
aliens for voting in our
elections yeah absentee ballots
permanent absentee ballot list
will increase the fraud this
been going on.
The end of you know this is the
way backward is not a way
forward this provides less
protection doesn't provide more
protection of Nunes we freely
should be going back to paper
ballots.
In use in our eyes eyes eyes and
hands to count coca vote.
That's all thank you thank you
Sir Erin Clements.
Can you hear me we can hear you
okay thank you.
R. I am opposed to spell the the
title voting rights protection
is laughable this is the voter
fraud Bill yes so I should be
ashamed of herself for
supporting this bill and
denigrating other states are
adding.
Relations.
to avoid referring submit tacky
individuals public or private in
your testimony you have thirty
seconds remaining.
Each.
Okay let's go to LA Sante.
Good afternoon madam chair and
members of the committee I'm a
taxpayer from Bernalillo county.
At voter from Bernalillo county.
Part of the better together New
Mexico advocates who care very
much about election integrity
the concept of man of
registering people to vote
without their permission without
their knowledge and then sending
a card to people instructing
them that if they don't qualify
they need to self identify and
you know on register themselves
is ridiculous I care very
greatly about my vote and be
voted every legitimate.
Registered voter in the state
and I encourage you to vote
against house bill four.
Thank you Mr Sunday Mr
Hutchinson.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee my name is Howard
Hutchinson.
I oppose this bill for for the
reasons previously stated by
other opponents.
I believe that.
Sen opening don't fix it.
I never had a problem
registering to vote or voting in
the in the state of New Mexico
and I've done so three different
times when I've moved from
different counties three so
thank you madam chair members of
the committee please oppose.
The house bill.
Thank you Mr Hutchinson Leanne
and there.
Thank you madam chair my name is
Li enteric and I'm speaking I'm
at as a try and if the native
American and Navajo Nation
tribal members specifically from
the two budget city chapter
house I'm also a registered
voter registration agent and
also the mother of prisoners so
what I want to share with you
today is the fact that I oppose
the chapter house portion of
this bill
because I do government chapter
house I'm concerned about the
possibility of mis placed
election material
in the event that it taking
Border agents to the location of
the residence of voters this is
open to the hands on our ballots
I'm also concerned about
community centers open and
tribal eight locations as it
would encourage voter turnout
but is not valid this would send
at non non V. R. A.'s or just
assistance to come out and help
people fill out absentee ballots
thereby influencing and taking
advantage of people that may not
have as yet is one equipment
business C. brown.
Chair an eighty I would like to
say that I have.
For the reasons that most people
have already stated I however it
might be an idea to take out the
data that.
In order to act and but it at
end of the bill.
Thank you Mr.
This.
Senator Browne.
