This is a memorial recognizing
the one hundred fiftieth
anniversary of the establishment
of the Mescalero Apache Indian
reservation.
And with that I'd like to turn
it over to my experts.
Hello my name the little tribal
council for Mexico.
And.
Just like tell you by you know
two hundred fifteen memorial.
Yeah we're gonna have it's.
It's about the tried.
Also for everybody else wrong
inside because.
We the tribe is been like a
melting pot for the actual
people because we have to echo
that came in from Oklahoma and
that the task you from Texas and
we all kind of knocked out the
Mexico and that's what that's
what makes Mexico is the
breeding of all the patient
people.
And then within those.
Hundred fifty years Mexico has
grown to be to work at right now
we we built we build upon what
we have and we have the mountain
understand why no which is to.
Thank the focal point of the of
the reservation but it's also a
focal point of you know like
which rural county thinking
County Chavis county it brings
in a lot of a lot of other
people into the future and.
Right now the school has grown
we've gone through generations
of families and hundred fifty
years is not that long you know
generation Y. just like maybe
five generations and some of
those people are still around

madam chair representative first
of all thank you for giving me
the opportunity to be here today
to speak on behalf of this bill
You know Mr bill touched on the.
Founding areas being able to
celebrate with us but I'd like
to take a little more
traditional route as far as our
people
you know we've been here for a
hundred fifty years it means a
lot to assist people
we read everyday that indigenous
language cultures you know
they're going away
for me this is important
because it brings our people
back together to commemorate a
hundred fifty years to remind us
of who we are as a people.
Come from and how important it
is for us to remember that
and as I said Mr little you know
explain everyone comes together
and we do you know we we are one
of the largest employers in the
southeastern part you know what
Carroll County
and we've all come together
we're very fortunate that Mr
Vincent here has brought this
bill forward but for me like I
said that is it's it's more of
the cultural aspect that so
important for us and so I would
like to thank you for the
opportunity as well and the
support that you will get the.
Thank you madam chair.

I'm here.
More a lot.
All right let's go to the next
available House Bill.
If this
There is.
The public.
My expertise on fields are yes
I'm telling you not.
Yes.
Okay Representative thank you
everyone for having at least a
few for house bill three to
eight the special financing on
it is major but use in house
economic
what is affected does increases
capital for commercial property
owners who are interested in
having G. of fission
building permanent structures
and so would have been closed
adding solar anything else in
the potentially goes from on in
general there are there these
are drugs there is zero dollars
out of pocket in the low cost
financing to allow us to be able
to do this mechanism is that
it's tied to the building itself
not to the property owner so if
they have to go through the
county to have the special
assessment put on to the
property and information for the
life of that.
Thirty years to do that.
The counties involved we work
extensively with the counties to
ensure that this would be
amenable to what they're able to
do which is why we have a
committees of the supposed to
fulfill and I believe that we we
come to an agreement that makes
our top
I it also ensures County it's up
to them hi dollars or if they
want to have a special festive
from your inner hearing so
completely voluntary what I
really enjoy about this is it is
economic development and all the
simple what I've seen before our
own state this community of
quest that had it has a very
unique track on the development
fund and they're able to make
their business park entirely
provincial because of that one
factor they were able to bring
inTaos breaks into their their
community and find jobs there
because of that one thousand.
So as counties as property
owners are advertising trying to
reach you know new clientele
occupied spaces between needs
more commercial station Garcia
and ways for economic
development of you know this
could be a of that.
The other half to really about
possible with those of these
people and I think one of the
arguments these already
described programs are a number
of states including Colorado and
so your eyes were answered
questions mix for ninety refer
to some of those programs as
well on the cell phone line
should be I.
He is the senior vice president
council for public for policy
and programs at hedges partners
and they are one of the funding
for.
From the gauges in this type of
finance and so Michael I know
you all have losses in
regulating three forty want to
add I believe every.
Talk.
Thank you very much chair
representative of your
leadership Michael yaki senior
vice president at risk based
finance also representing the
sea bass Alliance the industry
group that works on C. pace in
the thirty three states we
currently operate we are very
happy with the bill that the
representative has brought to
this committee and we ask for
your support and any questions
on the subsystem this I'd be
glad to
answer over four billion dollars
worth of projects to be done in
these thirty three states your
neighbors in Colorado Texas New
and there is and New Mexico have
been.
Thank you all right let's go to
the audience for.
Public comment those in support
of the bill please reach your
hands all right let's start with
my right.
Please try to make your stay in
one minute.
Absolutely thank you very much
Committee members of the
committee funding to figure that
Representative renewable energy
industry association of New
Mexico processes numbers.
Two thousand four this bill
provides a tax money and options
to developers to to implement
water conservation energy
efficiency renewable energy in
resilience in their projects the
legislation corporations best
practices that have been used
and possibly twenty other
states.
And that basically in the system
legislation was passed in two
thousand nine so what's in those
best practices in addition to
targeting commercial building
structures requires consent or
require certification of
projects including the fives
eligibility.
This long term financing that is

the committee my name is raven
Samuel thank you secretary
director for now but now is a
commercial real estate
development association what it
really means is responsible for
the bill to more we have seniors
and juniors developers
contractors all memberships and
I stand in strong support of
this bill and one of the
sponsors for bringing it forward
so many things about this bill
that I think you should know why
shouldn't pass it is that the
development industry wants to
make buildings more energy
efficient because we recognize
that not only is it good for our
environment but it's good for
our bottom line.
This legislation will help us I
equity.
And developing to attack
recently to convert existing
buildings and it's yet another.
To help us improve our built
environment invest funds to
advance in.
Energy so thank you for your
time today for the
the.
All public comment in support of
the bill.
Please.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee my name is Doris
person I'm the executive
director for New Mexico counties
I want to start by thanking the
sponsors of the advocates of
this bill for working with us
this is been something that we
kind of struggled with we
realize the intense important
but it is put treasures of the
position of having to collect
which often the mortgage
companies are willing to take
second place which is why we're
really not gotten off the ground
but with that said they were
really able to address our
concerns with this bill we think
this is a win win the other
structures no opposition to
support just that it wasn't
before and for that we're very
grateful and appreciate the
support from both the entire
counties as well as the
treasures and the assessors
thank you thank you let's go to
the webcast.

Madam chair members of the
committee my name is Erica yes
I'm going Ana County treasurer
and I am also the legislative
chair twelve treasures of
millions today I'm here to speak
in support of H. B. two twenty
eight as substituted by the
house commerce and economic
development committee originally
we we sat in opposition for the
bill because of the primary
reasons opted out at the tax tax
laws sorry low liability to the
tax bill therefore compromising
the integrity of the tax bill
itself MHRD treasures and to
part of the to private
collectors for our collective
for private entities for these
loans and included the lien
priority as co equal and in
prior legislation to property
tax is out along taxes which
competes with property tax
revenues that we collect and
also lack consumer protections
for residential pace programs
these are primary reasons why
treasures would always oppose
pace what the sponsors have done
though is a work with us to
address these issues and so
we've changed our position to
our support because they're able
to address these issues and and
I am now speaking on behalf of
the Chargers legislative
committee to support the bill
and we appreciate the the
sponsors and their
representatives for working with
us and addressing those concerns

one of.
The appropriate there as well.
Separate.
Twenty one twenty.
Yes.
Well.
My question on the amendment is
Weissman county considered a
local public body fighting this
already covered.
Of Madam chair representative I
also would like to of of asked
that I do have another expert
online music service our local
county attorney is also
available for questions but we.
And I'm sorry.
I have I am chair I just same
question.
And it's only because the way
you can find back so it's just
for the purpose of consistency.
We provide.
will come.
Would be the same but because
they identified as several
I see on page eight.
All political subdivisions
except counties municipalities
and school.
Okay
Chair.
Representative my question would
be I believe it was sent earlier
in the opening this is.
Be allowed to do what we
disabilities are we can but it
looks like on page eight
municipalities are excluded as
well from local public bodies
so.
Where municipalities doing it
when parents can't.
They're excluded on page eight.
Sure we we don't understand
that.
Okay.
Yes come back to the and we're
still on the.
Sorry to interrupt.
Representative Alcon yes madam
chair start.
Yes it is we're amending the
recounting draft also math that
believes that already page one
line twenty three if that.
Hello we fantastic is also
appropriate page
the six six one.
The manager of to.
To close up of over the to the
changes that we have page one
one point three K..
Yes we have I.
Line sixteen.
K. five one twenty one.
Six one to.
For example.
Right.
We have the.
The motion to adopt those
changes would.
The amendment as described the.
All of those.
I twice and six point nine K..
And we have a second what looks

this we have an amended bill
thank you.
The staff to.
And double check the corrections
and now back to committee with
representatives of the thank you
a clarification on page eight
please line twenty four twenty
five.
The the these definitions
I just wanted to make sure that
I'm clear on this madam chair
eight local public body means of
political subdivisions.
We are removing.
Counties.
But we are at the except.
No.
Madam chair representative.
Loses its on that page eight
line twenty five because this
would exclude counties and I
thought we were it was my
understanding we're trying to
achieve parity.
I think we answered in the order
counties and then management.
We did.
So.
Madam chair if we could do for
to Mr Mr Gooding you set the
Frankfort Indiana county.
Perhaps you would have a better
rest.
Mr good and can you hear us.
The local public body therefore
they're not required to go to
the state board of finance and
so by accepting pounds from the
definition of local public
bodies it would remove that
requirement from the town well
and that's what we're.
So that we have that.
So that we are able with the
county this fall the public
property and send back in the in
Mrs power.
for that place.
For.
The change of madam chair and
Representative lot of now that
we have the attorney on the
other line I want to make sure
that we got everything else.
So do you want.
Chair Mister would you
Excuse me do you have any
comments on the on the amendment
says we're making to the bills.
Madam chair representative I
believe that by the the issue is
Senator one of the issues raised
FIR as well for more rapidly FIR
the.
In order that was
not included in the listening
manager only lives both.
The amendment with that.
For about by on.
Last year.
The.
Mmhm.
Working through page five where
we had extensive.
Trying to make sure we're on the
flight changes we don't tend to
tend to.
Legislative determination this
line fifty a written
determination is been made state
agency local public bodies
school district or state
educational institution can sell
or dispose of properties.
Without the word county in
their.
The bodies that cannot.
Are counties and municipalities.
We are putting county and we're
allowing counties we're not
allowing municipalities
municipalities.
Our excluded because of the
definition on page eight.
Is that the intent.
That we're adding counties to be
able to do something.
That municipalities can all.
Representative I would like to
defer to ensure good for the.
Representative.
I will miss the powers are
already over the property now
whether.
Representative probably should
have been listed in the one
we're gonna have the
legislature's and moving with
both of their property I want to
be in there well but I think the
way that is what that work
because they were not defined
the public body do not require
their approval from the board of
finance
What we replies
to majors are we happier is to
take away the requirement of
approval from the board of
finance municipalities are not
local government and because I
can do before on
The log in.
There.
What law the savage Sen water
pool of that.
All the property.
Local public body of mentioned
in their methodology that all
local public bodies so they
don't have that restriction.
I think you're all more about
whether or not on page five
water treatment news weather up
there often by the way the
statues currently right in the
in the fall of the property that
that's a good question
but I think where the
municipalities of what that is
have they're not defined the
local public body they were able
to do that anyway without and
did not require the approval of
the state for signing up.
Madam chair representative
understand that on the page
sixty seven aircraft the.
By the changes we made on page
eight.
The real issue is not requiring
state board of finance approval
for the transactions of more
than five thousand dollars
that's the real kicker.
And.
Municipalities were excluded
from the local public body
definition there on page three
page seven and now we've
excluded counties as well
because what he did on page
eight.
So you have solved the problem
of having to go in front of.
Borderlands right there.
I'm gonna go back and say I
think that solved a problem and
I'm not sure we need county and
all these other places I think
we've done things you did.
Five fifteen county in.
Page six page cry with two
places page one that's doing
other things not.
The code before the finance for
problem that you were trying to.
Madam chair representative I'm
not I'm afraid we change things
you did not want to do.
We have made other disparities
between municipalities and
counties that did not exist now.
Instead of fixing one.
Madam chair representative I
defer to Mister for that as
well.
Access to.
One of the first year of
Representative well I think
what.
Six I tell you the practice of
municipalities of the bay do
this both of of public property.
They do not require the approval
of the board of finance whether
because they currently are not
with their the public body are
from that whether this statute
authorizes their disease both of
us and there may be another
staff people here is about four
well I'm not sure but I know
that if we were to just
she that well public body
While out of we were taken out
of the definition of local
public brought with without
making any other changes for the
telephone it could possibly are
we argue that hello have not
both the public property
the on page five.
We have the quality of the very
few agencies local public body
for the state educational
institution our property for not
giving discounts our ability to
do that because we would no
longer be a public bodies at the
time of your
The definition.
On a so that's why people added
goals work vandalism for.
Because otherwise I have some
unintended consequences for the
health and I I don't know what
municipalities thank you because
of what I will do that right is
saying that they cannot do it
now because our offices listed
or or not but.
By leaving the county without a
will
on page five I think that for
those on the consequences of
this back to Capitol Building
potentially all the property at
all.
Representative Zamora you madam
chair and presenters I wonder if
this needs to go back to the
drafters and the need to look at
it maybe role it Madam anymore
really look at instead of us
doing it on the fly and get
things right would hate to
impose someone municipalities.
To.
We meet tomorrow.
With the would you like to
temporary roles this bill and
work on it I need to right this
Madam will will take a lot of
cases out of thank you for this
really helpful for rural areas
straightforward honest for the
act tomorrow thank you.
We'll go to the house bill
fourteen.
Please.
Right Laura.
Thank you members of the
committee the house bill
fourteen I would
like to total of under the
Google fiber for three.
Activity at well without the use
of provisions or terms act and
of.
To further explain the bill I
would like to my experts in this
to yourself thank you.
Committee members are fake or
futurity
worked on issues related to
problems we had in New Mexico
military activity to and
specifically one is a group that
had gathered on the southern
border stopping.
people crossing the border ends.
Control.
That led to federal prosecutions
not state prosecutions and then
I worked with that districts
turning now to the general for
us having Georgetown Moscow is
constitutional protection.
Medications including Mexico
Civil Guard which had begun
organizing showing up at
protests focus primarily
Bernalillo county
in a manner that Rep Phelps
constitution state constitution
prohibits private to activity
today Mexico doesn't have a law
scalar to effectively preventing
paramilitary groups mobilizing
for acts of intimidation.
this act would address that it
provides we're ready that was
both provided means for
effective prosecution also put
the public on notice on what
happens with fall between

I would accomplish that and
conform to the constitution
warns this is a few point mutual
proposed legislation
from which is critical wide
anyone regardless of ideology
who engages in.
To the outside control
it also
falls within the parameters

Columbia versus Heller case that
recognize the second amendment
is an individual right in that
decision cited in the T. V. six
K. noting that private
paramilitary activity can be
from the states also we're
following within.
The balance between
constitutional rights and
protecting the public statutes
drawn on the model statute
created by the institute for
constitutional protection to to
conform constitution warms but
also.
Thank you let's go to the
audience those in support of the
bill please raise your hand.
Senator.
Madam chair members the
committee wanted to change very
soon chief deputy Attorney
General's office future
general's office supports
abortion advocacy two things
about this will one of the
paramilitary activity is very
dangerous even if there is an
opportunity to page with
protesters I've spoken to many
of the police officers responded
to the scene at the United yes
Albuquerque their job is more
difficult because there are
military members automatic
weapons at this.
The other thing I want to say is
this in the district attorney's
office for the for those at the
time that the issues are.
And we realized that.
Prosecutors built with the to
respond.
In terms of this bill sponsored
report thank you madam chair.
Thank you
further comments in support of
the bill.
C..
Webcast do we have any comments
in support of hospital fourteen.
Will stay on the webcast for
opposing COVID.
Seeing none
in the audience for closing
comments okay committee members
Representative lock thank you
madam chair thank you
Representative for bringing this
forward so.
I have some questions regarding
some of the parts of this bill
on page three right now.
So the bottom here start thing.
Unlawful for a person who part
of a paramilitary organization
behalf of.
Or in furtherance of the
objectives of the parliamentary
organization.
Well armed with a firearm
explosive device or other
dangerous weapon knowingly
publicly Patrol drill or
engaging techniques capable of
causing bodily injury or death
so madam chair representative
I'm just wondering so let's just
say I.
There's three different
individuals who were friends.
They're all armed let's just say
they see some important in
getting a tax across the street.
One guy who I guess to mandate
for leader as well as what is
shown in this bill there's a.
The organization structure
technically what if he says
let's go safely and ends up in
bodily harm or death of that
statement with the individual
could be charged under this law
Madam chair representative of
chair representative of my to
defer to my experts.
If you could just stop if it's
okay with you Madam just ask for
the questions or thank the
to a block
no circumstance the fence
another which is a protected
activity under the law moreover
we look at the definition of
paramilitary organization I
think it would be difficult for
prosecutors proved beyond
reasonable doubt that a group
that just happened to be arms
together set up a command
structure on the fly like that
respond with this is more
tailored for organizations that
are set up for the purpose of
operating as effective military
law enforcement outside civilian
control.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative.
You know I I think that's good I
would like to see that staff to
do you know where in law that is
kind of viruses it fits in
defense of Madam chair
representative block I have to
find a job function on defense
of another but it's an accepted.
For the log principal
Yes well settled in the second
by the jurisdictional map but I
don't think I statute because I
think it's a common law offense
it's just an accepted for for a
long time thank you madam chair
thank you Representative okay
well I just I think of certain
times when people are trying to
defend something right like
let's just say.
I'm.
I can give examples of the
protest for instance what if
someone's trying to attack a
government building for instance
and there comes a few
individuals who are walking by
no there's three of
And there's one guy who's the
leader you could say that's this
bill says there has to be
perfect and these are to defend
the building.
If there is no one else
defending it with that be
protected madam chair
representative if that happened.
Madam chair representative
blocked I'm not sure that would
be protected because defending
the building with deadly force
would be alive it's part of the
goal here is to have the
military law enforcement perform
the functions that we rely on to
perform and not having private
citizens take it upon themselves
to set up organizations.
Adjacent to that as if they are
authorized to do things that we
only allow law enforcement and
military to do so I think that
in the situation of protecting
public building.
You might have somebody across
the lot.
Representative well I'm just
thinking of rural areas I know
it may be a very long time until
police can get there to the
scene and let's just say there's
an insurrection that happens
people start storming a building
and good Samaritans madam chair
representative who may or may
not be the armed are protecting
that building and the public
employees within an Madam chair
representative they if there's
not police that can get their
medially like Lester St five to
ten minutes and they're there to
protect those individuals who
are public servants madam chair
I think that this could
potentially charge them.
When they're just trying to do
is civic duty as Americans to
protect their fellow Americans
madam chair so with the food you
want chair representative Madam
chair representative for sure I
think if you got the
circumstance where there's an
armed attack on building be back
in defense another you also have
the recognize documentary Mexico
law citizens arrest which is an
error Dr it should be allowed to
expand beyond that but if you
observe a felony occurring you
have additional rights under the
law what this is trying to do is
prevent groups from setting up
for the purpose of acting as
though they're taking
practically show up to do what
law enforcement military.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative so does the state
anywhere in here preemptively.
The work is in here about
sorry madam chair representative
block need to jump straight to
the answers
under the definition
paramilitary organization.
Preemptive activities implied in
the census establishing command
structure
for the purpose of functioning
in public or training to
function public is a contact
combat support law enforcement
or security services unit
there's a element of of
organization and planning that
goes into that I think you'd be
hard pressed situation where
people just gather on emergency
basis similar to if there's a
fire if everyone gets together
part of our they're not creating
there are creating a
paramilitary organization of
fighting fire.
And setting it up in that
circumstance so I I would
expect that prosecutors have the
wisdom to not try to stretch the
statute to deal with emergency
circumstances where it's not.
activities defense of people and
property and.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative I think that my
opinion is a lot of questions
that attorney because.
Committee.
The DPRK let's just say there's
three folks that they all.
The some former military.
Police and one of them was the
captain and the rest of them
were under them so madam chair
representative you could
technically say that guys giving
orders there's some kind of
command structure that
previously was there and this
thing does happen I think we're
just giving too much authority
that districts charge based on
that chair representative so
Maybe if you would define
command structure madam chair.
Bill I would be a lot more
comfortable with this
legislation Madam chair
representative would you be open
to that.
I am clients to it's not my
built up to the Representative
but if if I was asked my opinion
on that I would say that that's
no more broad and that the
regular statutes that
prosecutors have to exercise
discretion of funding that is
and there's a check on the
prosecutor in the form of
graduate preliminary injunction
ultimately a jury if there is a
long decision charge checks that
we have in the system which.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative and you you
mentioned a couple instances
where this has happened to the
border and then also in
Albuquerque at some protests
Madam chair representative for
those individuals charters stand
today.
Do they get off on the senator.
What.
Different outcomes in different
circumstances and the southern
border issues.
I'm not happy dollars by federal
law enforcement there's a
secretion they had to prosecute
the leader on related charge
happen to be the spelling
possession of firearm
histories to structure that and
then another member of that
organization start traveling for
impersonating a federal officer
on this item Sir Senator.
Thank you for that the rest of
the group that is down seven
were prosecuted the New Mexico
Civil Guard matter had to be
dealt with civil legal criminal
charges
additional through the junction
is attained through a through
Albuquerque District Court judge
Last year.
So they were enjoined from
further activity but there was
no criminal prosecution.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative and your.
Thank you very.
I wrote it down is.
Thank you madam chair
representative of the questions
I have Representative Chasey in
the Representative Zamora thank
you madam chair moved past
second.
Because our table.
And madam chair so so the
incident in Albuquerque that
you're testifying about.
Was that incident.
Then it turned out to be a self
defense.
Yes Madam chair representative
Zamora what I understood.
The the individual who is
charged with shooting from the
Office statute
set you protest argued self
defense I don't know what
happened.
Spurned his participation that
activity in the New Mexico Civil
Guard involve you to protest
jobs were director.
There were a series of events
leading up to that began by
calling the masters which is
normally should turn to recruit
and set up command structures
and number counties across the
state.
Albuquerque and.
Showing us serial protests but
if you're referring to that
specific issue and we are in
self defense he was not a member
of the Civil Guard and the issue
was that the presence of an
armed organized group dressed in
military our operating systems
law enforcement military
escalated the situation and
added to the tension you can
see.
And things here.
That's not to lay blame only on
one side helpful helpful
provisions of the public debate
over the statue to have.
In the madam chair and senator I
just see some second amendment
rights.
Issues with this bill and and.
I
I just won't be able to support
your bills are for that that
that.
To see some improvements on
second.
So madam chair.
that's all that's all I have to
say thank you I have a motion on
a table for two passed in the
second please take role
Representative on the north yes.
Representative block no Sir
Representative Chasey yes.
Representative Hochman Vigil.
Yes.
Representative little yes.
Representative bring.
Representative Zamora nope.
But the growth yes.
Madam Johnson yes.
Okay pass thank you very.
The next week.
Just to forced.
Madam chair and fellow members
of the.
State government elections
Committee happy that Watson from
the City of Albuquerque even is
the city clerk and
essentially what the purpose
property this.
Try to accommodate other
accommodate other newness of
holidays if they would like to
be included it's totally and
optional for them but the bill
as drafted to allows
municipalities with populations
of over two hundred thousand to
offer from Manhattan for
Turnitin.
In addition to an in person
hearing to contest citations for
news service or Alexion's
the issue.
As excuse me the sense that
raise this issue is this beating
elections that the City of
Albuquerque's trying very hard
to address with this and the
city understands the need to
provide
process that also simplified and
more efficient option for both
the respondents and the newness
of holidays to receive and
provide due process Senate
clarifies that no fees or costs
commute posed and it changes the
recipient of a portion of fines
and fees from the administrative
office of the courts to the
general fund this is consistent
with Representative not and it
is house bill one thirty eight
that the administrative office
of the courts is supporting to a
limited service fees and Mr
Watson is here absolutely
just we're doing Daddy.
Sure thank you madam chair cases
members of the committee on City
of Albuquerque and issuing
citations through the automated
speed enforcement program about
may as of today state issue
around thirty nine thousand
citations
people like structured fast
enough for these we have a rate
of about one about one percent
of those citations result in an
appeal
and each appeal under current
state law requires effectively
in in person forcing hearing you
do not have the option to mail
in or online like your
and there's a lot of staff comes
as members you're more officer
IT officer presentation
attorneys and these hearings can
last between five and thirty
minutes we had a number of
hearings where people been found
not guilty and because their car
was stolen their car was sold
they haven't updated their
registration
and so these this bill really
does tend to address that
because I don't I don't think
they should have to have a
hearing just to prove that to us
if they can submit a online form
saying here's my police report
saying my car was stolen great
like we can just with the
citation and so but the issue is
state law currently requires an
effective little fires in person
hearing and requires an in
person hearing to waive the in
person here sell we just would
like to offer million
alternative and it would be good
for the system script for us
yes.
Stammering questions issue.
Thank you alrighty let's go to
the audience do we have
audience.
In support of the bill.
G..
That serves very much lobbyist
the city residential I just want
to wanted clarification we're
sitting around some of the
city's about one hundred
thousand hello to the talked
about and then just us to
qualify for that millions
that mail in fuel which I.
On in so many words works with
although I think this is a
private citizen and not crazy
that speed cameras because
allegedly I may have gotten the
state as well leaving the
register health department was
not available as of fuel.
On orders of all I actually have
the ability to get to my wife.
Representative father was.
Of these tickets.
Program of the the disease down
for the pop up to twelve miles.
So I don't getting thank you
madam chair.
Chairman and madam chair I was I
was going to say is is that Mr
and is getting the story that I
was pretty sure his daughter's
witnesses.
We were not the same time so I.
Comments.
I have forgotten to say my eight
two seven eight allow our cat
contacted start the other cities
might want to do this so it's
entirely optional but with the
amendment that has been
distributed to the committee
and.
to a two number.
To what.
Once you have it all right okay
all right.
Go ahead please.
Two two five six four seven
point.
And.
This particular
Would allow smaller.
It is hard.
Also.
Avail itself of this option.
Okay.
Discussion on the amendment to
the members
of.
Okay we have a motion to adopt
the amendment.
And we have a second
any opposition seeing none we
have and opted.
The bill.
Representative.
By Representative Zamora amended
bill.
Yes madam chair and thank you
for centers so if somebody.
Yes a speeding ticket when these
automated cameras.
Do they still will they still
right the one in person.
Madam chair representative.
I apologize for thank you yes it
is that's your choice so what
whatever option at least and
City of Albuquerque but overall
if you want.
If they want to pursue it would
still be able to do that it's
just is this does appear to be a
certain subset really don't have
a hearing.
I still change the reserves and
madam chair.
Representative.
Would it be fair for me to ask
the question about how the
cameras work.
And what the limits are when
they get a speeding ticket all
that.
Senator it's kind of beyond the
scope of the failed.
Maybe just a request to.
Some Madam chair representative
I mean I don't.
I'm an expert on the hearings
and not necessarily an expert on
the technical aspects of the
cameras so so so let me
clarifying question madam chair
Senators so
I'm not worried about the
technicality of the cameras but
just so that I can understand it
better like if you're going one
mile over the speed limit you
get together it goes.
Thank the witness said ten miles
over then the new ticket.
We.
Madam chair please experience.
Experience but but also we work
on the legislation several years
ago when senator Sanchez I
should put a hundred dollar cap
and at that time was for the
city of Los crucis so what
happens when you get one of
those tickets madam chair
representative of a license
plate and then it shows the
speed and each individual so you
can make a determination how far
over the speed limit one two
have the ticket unfortunately
Rio Rancho is eleven which is
exactly what my wife was driving
from.
but but they can't set those for
for around and typically chair
representative they will seven
so it's a total reform out over
the state I think the most in
Los crucis use the line ranchers
clearly left.
Clearly see which of course
story spring.
But thank you madam chair and
thank you for that that's all
the questions I can.
Committee members.
Representative a lot thank you
madam chair thank you
Representative.
our madam.
Democratic leader and expert so.
Does this or this increase the
amount of tickets that are
being.
Even out madam chair
representative of.
Madam chair representative block
this is just providing an option
for when someone's already
getting getting ticket gets one
regarding the.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative so with this.
We added in the amendment other
municipalities under hundred so
this we can be an option for
every single municipality I
would I would assume Madam chair
representative.
Madam chair representative
blocked yes it would if it's a
municipality has a speed camera
program they could offer the
option of conducting.
Correct a smaller songs.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you Representative experts so
then.
What are the costs associated
with the hearings now and what
do you project the savings would
be if it we have a lot more
people doing it in the mail
Madam chair representative.
deferred Mr Watson.
Madam chair representative
block.
Hospitalier for the hearings are
fairly significant I have full
time staff person just as the
contract no a full time hearing
officer in this is one of the
types see here's.
I don't know.
These hearings are a little bit
difficult project so I don't
have numbers people would opt
into this I mean I can say that
so thus far we have a four
hundred eighty eight we've had
sixty nine people who were found
not guilty that is two things
like the car not being so on and
so or the car being stolen are
there in the records on it so I
think those.
Right there that's of these
On the third to those hearings
that would not necessarily have
to conduct so tension eight
thirty percent I don't have.
All right thank you madam chair
thank you Representative.
Expert yeah I just.
More share on this bill It all
keep on reading I appreciate it
Madam Representative thank you
thank you Representative little
mentioned with a do pass.
We have a motion for to pass.
In the second do we have any
opposition please take well
Representative on in order yes.
In the block.
No answer.
Representative Chasey yes.

These.
Morning madam chair and
committee members
Read about how I want to start.
The opening on this and mainly
because.
This is.
What well hi.
Well the string of like to see
this bill
in order to get comments from
from all
comments from.
The morning session of that we
are with passing legislation.
And.
Well many times I disagree with
my colleagues I dial back the
you have and in the how we can
make something.
In this case this is a piece of
legislation that.
For for over two years.
And and close enough to to bring
in for that because.
I did like it was right still
much ready to get through it.
Schering from committee members
the reason why.
At this legislation written
etcetera but.
We return law making back to the
legislature's.
What we do right now in my
humble opinion we ride rules we
run off in the for the and the
agency needs promulgate rules.
Then we never really review the
rule to see if
the legislation.
This piece of legislation
required through the long
process and.
At the least one committee if
somebody in the process interim
committee says you know what I
don't think this will needs the
legislature pandemic this is not
why was this legislation for.
And.
There's a hundred and hundred
twelve legislators and many
times I feel like.
We're nothing more than about
that eleven leg cramps to the or
bureaucrats.
You know we get in the way of
them going to do whatever they
want to do and in so many ways
with givens givens such broad
forty two are different agencies
in our major ones thirty one of.
Have have such a broad authority
on on rulemaking.
That.
We can't control that.
There used to be and.
Representative Chasey.
Program your this one
there used to be a sector
revisions.
good shape.
On a.
Okay however often basically
they will go through that and
funds set to severity either
updated the committee had having
director.
One of the bills represent
another committee this morning
took out language so we've been
taking out fills for at least a
two years I've been here.
Place it was a different version
saying the same thing the same
thing in different ways so.
Madam chair and and.
Committee.
I expected.
Thirty one agencies don't have
legislation and I got six.
That.
There is that and and so Senator
or agencies in the that they
don't have the resources foreman
economic stuff.
And that self should tell us.
It bugs us all that we the state
New Mexico.
With our bureaucrat phone again
rules with out of the
termination positive or negative
economic impact to the state.
That's what's happening right
now.
I if you read everyone of these
agency analysis you read this
the school a factor for everyone
said they're saying we don't
have the resources to determine
whether or not our rural
listening in on off.
We're just gonna write.
Free by our.
At the top of the in calendar
twenty twenty two four hundred
ninety two.
Reductive of.
None of the rules.
Provided by.
We didn't get to put impact in
with respect to.
you know during the rulemaking
we didn't get to give our own
and after our own letters to
committee or anything like that
we did as a committee we did
within is a legislative body
moving that.
There's two pieces of our
constitution that that I think
that this really really unpack
several the number of article
forty tells us very specific
references in government right
so one piece of legislation
leads to.
To the executive branch to and
within those departments under
the executive branch right those
rules.
We get the opportunity to go
look and see if those rules
actually nothing that the
legislation.
And that's where my problem
isn't we talked for the last
several years several years.
That
We the legislative body should
should.
Make our decisions based on
that.
The FIR and six agency reports
you have in front of the tell
you that our agencies are doing
that.
So.
Another argument to use the
inside of these reports.
Transaction fusion rules
understanding the guidelines I
funding sources.
In the in my answer to that is
you know.
Eight people state governments
difference in the sense that it
really shouldn't be want to go
governments primary roles as a
supporter of this right we look
so much move that so many
conversations this year about
economic development.
Agencies Senator the agencies
propose this process.
We have a permitting process
business down from six to
eighteen months.
With no regard what that does to
the business for what that does
to the revenue of the state.
And my mother used to say what's
good for the goose is good for
the gap.
My perspective on this is if you
know you have fund these guys.
Then at the end and deadline.
Get the rules of place get get a
process quick enough to where
you need to discuss.
And
I think the the agent
Keeps the in their report.
Tells us that I'm delaying the
adoption of the rules and my
answer is that we should.
We should once again our
agencies need to be reminded
that we the legislators for the
one to have to answer for their
actions.
Thank you to continue on with
whatever they're doing this and
they will we go back to our
districts.
And so this is what happened
with that little.
What were you thinking.
Well guess what the move we work
thinking because we weren't
allowed to do are fronts.
We make the law we're not
allowed to be part of the
process with respect to the
rule.
So with that I think that
there's an accountability for.
And the our agencies are your
parents need to understand
through the report.
At the end of the day they need
to be reminded voters process
and that they need to be
accountable for the roles right
right just like we're held
accountable we go back to our
constituents that gentleman
stand for questions and I really
really truly hope I get great
comments back because only uses
to if.
If the pass of the one that I
think I think but the other side
of that is
I want this work at some point
in time it's all of the positive
comments the negative comments
this is Terrence State this is
why I can't deal with your
legislation right now this can
help you help us.
Sicko thank.
Thank you Representative we will
go to the audience in the room
at this point is here in support
of house bill four oh nine raise
your hand.
There is opposition in the room
to house bill for augmentation
the.
And we will check.
Well to.
This is the soon we have folks
in support of house bill four
hundred nine.
And saying that we have folks in
opposition to house bill for
All right Mr Ortiz.
Just one.
I madam chair can you hear me
yes Mr Ortiz.
Thank you madam chair and
members of the committee for
allowing me to speak my name is
Matthew Ortiz I am the division
director for the administrative
law division of the state
records center and archives we
are the repository for all
administrative rules filed in
the state of New Mexico we are
also the publisher of all
notices of rulemaking and
administrative rules in the New
Mexico register I want to.
Thank the sponsor in the
committee for allowing me to
speak I want to address really
two quick points first as it
relates to notice and
particularly notice to the
legislature there is already a
requirement in law in the state
rules act section fourteen for
two.
Representative seven of
subsection do that requires that
agencies were gonna proposed
rulemaking provide to
Legislative Council and then
Legislative Council provide to
all standing at interim
committees all notice of
rulemaking and proposed rules so
that is already required in law
as it relates to accountability
one of the comments that I want
to raise well well it doesn't
necessarily affect are part of
the rulemaking process my
observation in handling rules
for over ten years is that some
of the requirements that are
being put forward in the
proposed bill particularly as it
relates to having economic
impact studies
vetted by interim committees or
for rulemaking can be rules can
be adopted would greatly
increase the efficiency that
some if not all state agencies
would have to have and I just
want to point out as some of the
committee may know some state
agencies are under federal not
just state mandates and so
departments such as the
department of health Human
Services Department some EMNRD
energy natural resources and
minerals departments all have
federal responsibilities as part
of their rule making that would
be greatly affected if not the
the lady if of this bill was
passed and so with that madam
chair members of the committee I
will close my call.
Thank you Mr or tease.
I'm seeing no other comments
online.
We'll go to the committee for
robust discussion Representative
take our thank you madam chair
and thank you Representative
Pettigrew so.
I and I.
I don't believe that idea for us
to have some sort of indication
of what the fiscal impact of the
rules my fate which you're
asking what you're asking is
going to cost a lot of money
because you're asking for it
affect this cocaine Act study
before there is a rule proposed.
That seems.
Inordinately thirty seven to
This is the state government and
it seems to me also
Representative Pettigrew and I
don't think you and I have been
stage discussion of our.
Whether we need more legislative
Tyler on it but you.
mention Representative that
you're concerned we don't have
enough inflect well we don't
have time for the input that
doesn't even involve rulemaking
right now because we simply
aren't here you know we and I
don't mean here but we two weeks
we could do it at home if we
were doing anything else in our
lives so madam chair it that's
by the fact that if we want to
professionalise legislature
maybe we can do a better job on
all of this and perhaps it might
be
I don't.
There was a time.
And
quite sure where we are now but
I think it's a practice that
when for example there's a new
criminal law proposed that the
bill during the course of the
legislators deliberation I.
often goes to the Appropriations
Committee if it's the kind of
law that will result is a great
deal more incarceration or a
great deal more let's say
litigation so because you have
an effect on the courts the
public defender the district
attorney some potentially county
jails or the corrections
department so you know that's
looking at what what you're
doing is going to cost isn't
about idea but it might be a
little precipitous to doing when
you're not even adopting the
role you're proposing you're
you're you're saying combat
about this role put this out for
public comment you get public
comment everybody the department
request whatever agencies doing
it says on this isn't going to
work and they go to something
else that did you really want to
spend whatever it costs to do
the economics Daddy.
Of that who.
All so I'm not by the.
Thank you madam chair and
representative I appreciate that
and that's the reason why we're
having this conversation is so
as as I've gone back and forth
since November of two thousand
twenty with this bill in my own
head and back and forth
Legislative Council when's the
right time to do that study and
at the telling of it.
Impact on it this is sherry
makes it untenable with
With business.
And by this were were we already
have a written role.
I just got a bad impact with
our.
So in the beginning we know
we're going to be Mexico's rule
because there is legislation
that says we're gonna make role
don't get me wrong we have a.
Small slides many departments
that have.
Complete brought make broad rule
writing authority without even
talking to us.
They do it all day all.
They write rules that there's no
legislation I.
And there's no oversight on that
committee on that rulemaking
that says wait a minute how does
this fit in with statute I'm not
saying there's not a whole bunch
of people were teachers and
they're looking at that.
This is the right legislation
the people that are responsible
for the loss on to be part of
that process.
We also heard.
Chair that that
you know there's no obligation
for them to tell us how many of
y'all get get that I've never
once the size of the this the
department so I specifically
track on my own.
Receive the notice and interim
committee.
The rulemaking.
Mentor to two summers in on
committees so I I appreciate
your college major leader very
much and anything that helps us
make this something were we just
all sit there and say you know
like this is really bad for.
So that they have I think it's a
bad idea and so no that is ready
thank you.
Meeting very yes Representative
little.
Thank you so let me preface this
madam chair with that statement
that I'm one of the newest
provided our here happy to be
here and also a former federal.
Federal.
With.
Earlier I.
He.
that
as a former.
Civil service.
is responsible for the.
Education or taking care of
legislation and rules that are
are developed when laws are
passed
it was it wasn't maybe is my
impression is maybe.
In.
Coming into this I.
Like and I'm gonna do offer some
thoughts uh in the spirit of
making something better I was a
bit surprised that the sponsors
are not part of the rulemaking I
mean the what I'm hearing
described is that there's a
disconnect perhaps between the
time that legislation is
developed and or passed and the
rulemaking process begins so I'm
wondering if what thank you.
Thank you to the gentleman on
the from the archives of for
describing some of that process
but and I appreciate that I'm
wondering is had been part of
the described.
Madam chair
part of following legislation
that has been passed.
is that not coming.
Madam chair representative for.
The experience that I've had
watching the rulemaking process
actually attending some of the
rulemaking meetings.
I've never seen the legislature
the proposed bill to where the
executive now the executive
office somebody from the
attorney's office or somebody
may be there but from a piece of
legislation to control stuff and
I've never seen.
Of the the person sponsor of
that legislation after
rulemaking itself doesn't mean
it didn't happen when I don't.
They're obviously the four
hundred ninety two though right
and two thousand twenty two and
I'm probably one to three.
Thank you and so my second
question and and I just had to
so thank you very much madam
chair that by second question
would be
concerning the timeline for
responses
I'm wondering if perhaps
Although the consideration might
be made to include time frames
for if they're not already
established because I understand
some will be are required to
have timelines
do you in your experience have
you seen.
Anything like timelines being
established for comment by the
sponsor by the Sanchez at to
include them in the loop
because.
And madam chair where I'm coming
from is if I'm being asked to
carry bills I accepted a certain
response a level of
responsibility with this that
well I may not be able to track
everything I am I do have that
responsibility and it's up to
the but I'm just wondering
How do you envision.
Might be that process.
I think you'd be great if the
legislature is.
If the person carried
legislation.
Went through the whole process
was able to find that back to me
that the interview just a moment
I am not an expert and experts
on these topics so I wouldn't
want to delay that process what
I'm describing is or could give
me a interesting madam chair and
representative is that because
I'm not the expert I'm relying
on them but it would be kind of
a Burger King efforts to not
delay hold up progress that need
to be as this is taking shape.
Madam.
I think that that is a great
idea without delaying the
process and yeah I think so many
times we see places that we're
enacting this will the squall.
And
Us in HSD upon the rules but we
don't give a limitations on
what.
from getting the rules so
the maintenance rules to the MVD
to
get rules on a driver's license
and may expand that to include
the license plate.
And so.
The bills about the driver's
license with rules include
something on license plates as
well I'm not saying they do that
I'm just giving you examples
where it could happen because
are always of the place Madam
chair representative also
believes that the if there is a
discussion down and says you got
six months to get this done in
your funding I think that we've
got I pass this process.
But I do think there still is a
piece of that should say Hey by
the way.
Somebody from legislative body
on looking at this as well.
Thank you thank you thank you
madam chair Representative block
in the representative on thank
you madam chair thank you
Representative for bringing this
forward you know I I think this
is a really really good idea in
theory.
I really like it Madam chair
representative because it would
hold us accountable for the
legislation that we pass and
madam chair representative
would.
Make sure that the intent behind
that legislation is carried out
through the process and actually
implemented the way that we're
we're asking about it now madam
chair representative I do see
that comment from the gentleman
from the soon that some of these
agencies are really regulated
Madam chair representative maybe
even putting some exceptions for
those with the federally
regulated.
Departments.
Look at this bill madam chair.
Representative we all this
argument about what we want more
powers which.
To representative I think this
exactly how it is every rule
that we're making it has to be
congruent with our policies here
as the legislature and I think
stopping the process.
You know if my stuff is process
for six months to pass something
that's actually a good piece of
regulatory framework that's a
good step in the right direction
madam chair so desperate for the
points I had and the other for
reducing the next version of
this bill.
Four point two.
Or is thank you madam chair
representative
Mr on that point
Just keeping you can for the
policy
yeah I don't fundamentally
disagree with what you're trying
to do with this bill but I did
noted page six insisted he.
We talk about five hundred
people's and how.
This bill and review the rules
with kind of active versus rule
and says
Subsection be heard looking at
lines twenty one twenty two of
this section shall be in effect
no longer than sixty days but
the current statute in the NMSA
like section fourteen four five
point six that emergency period
the hundred eighty days so for
the sake of confluence I would
think that we want to keep.
In keeping an elegant and
elegant way of saying it but we
want to.
And state of what is the current
statutes because to pass this
would change effectively with
all statute I understand that
correctly and I think it that
could get confusing because we
would have to that is in place
at once with two separate at.
The time frames number that's
really a question but thank you
thank you madam chair
representative madam chair for
permission
If we go to article three and
article four of our constitution
the sixty days is consistent
with that of the statute says.
Different and we probably should
be looking.
Once again that brings us to the
point of this bill if we have
the so we have is and like I
said UCSF Tory revision
committee through make sure that
there were no inconsistencies we
have one lane one in one
document another way another
document that was clarified and
cleaned up to the thank you the
the various.
Alrighty Representative vice
chair.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative bye Sir thank M.
bishop's idea.
Appreciate that
and I think you highlighted the
problems when you talk about we
had in the past as statutory
review interim committee.
And I would suggest that if we
are not keeping on top of our
staff to right now madam chair
representative that's our
starting point of.
The rules just gonna say the top
of of the entire page three
point.
That was NDTV all long
Representative.
About the rules maybe one year
across all departments we're
gonna be in the thousands if not
tens of thousands I know there's
more than one thousand and.
Asian for example.
There are so many.
That thank you
it's we're gonna have that
problem and madam chair
representative I would recommend
one.
More focused idea if we're gonna
try for this that has actually
been trying to educate and we
evaluation review it's also
statutory review.
Business reconciliation to look
at what.
Practicals or super expensive
business rules and regulations
to get rid of yes
Representative.
And maybe that and more.
In which we can start and just
start looking to are at the
right now we have all those
agencies and we have boards and
commissions I think are the
report said six divisions thirty
different board making these
rules.
And only has twelve of us.
I do I think some kind of ticket
target focus his idea if we want
to make it work
and maybe look at constitutional
issues because we make law.
Executive implements well and
we're there was a disconnect
that you do share is supposed to
step in and I would be the actor
so we might have to again nearly
enough that we don't step on
those constitutional division.
Thank you madam chair that's my
only comment.
Thank you.
Yes and check the to move to
table please promotion for the
second have a motion for a table

opposition please table
