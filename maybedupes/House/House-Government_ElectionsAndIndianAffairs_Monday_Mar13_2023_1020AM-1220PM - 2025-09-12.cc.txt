doesn't have an appropriation
but we I that Center on the
house bill two with a centrally
died for recurring general fund
appropriations along with the
responsibilities for which it
was otherwise assigned seat
and then of course there's
additional functions and
business support that that may
not come over one hundred does
this become.
In the next legislative session
for our reserve budget on this
on this part is
Senator question we receive your
approval of the amendment which
just give us some time to kind
of small this movie maker tools
and of course more property get
that budget transition the start
of this.
Thank you we'll go to the
audience now the.
please raise your hand.
What.
Madam supported a bill on one
six zero in opposition and
committee members
Representative.
Yes thank you.
As we move.
Thank you for your a couple of
pieces I see that this is
transferred.
Seems pretty straight forward
there were two pieces that were
brought up for consideration and
I was wondering if those had
been resolved and that involved
the inspectors of the
transportation division and the
regulation of ambulance
services how will this be
factored in.
Sectors of sure.
Thank you madam chair
two things one is we do have a
lot of members from the general
counsel's office from from PRC
fears they could answer some
more questions about to do today
but you may be referring to
madam chair representative about
the FIR recommendations for
those inspectors along with the
I'm sorry oversight functions
need to fit better and other
agencies so we we look at that
and consider that there may be a
green met with other agencies
more Tory vehicle inspections
and an oversight but until I
think we dug deeper into those
functions of capacity what we
have to totally versus what
staff personal resources we have
we're going to make a decision
when we see how you know those
functions play themselves out of
the car you can see where it's
better expertise in that area
than what.
So thank you very much Mr
secretary madam chair Center
so until that time it will
remain as is.
With the PRC is that correct
those two divisions chair
representative everything will
come over right so we would have
the flexibility to injury to the
intergovernmental joint powers
agreement or some sort of
agreement on behalf of the state
they were come over and then we
would execute any other
agreements for of.
Well agency support for thank
you very much thank you to okay
committee members.
Representative they have on the
hill Representative Rehm and
Representative law.
I thank you madam chair hello
Senator nice to see you.
Secretary nice to see you second
time I've heard this bill I love
this bill.
I just want to get it on record
a second time that I think that
this is an issue that needs to
be on the forefront during the
interim I think the
transportation committee should
take the lead and just keeping
in communication with your team
managing the transition making
sure that everything is
happening in a way that you know
smooth and if you need anything
from the legislature the
legislative process you can let
us know just so we can you know
how the smoothest transition
that we can but otherwise funds
I'm very excited about the PRC's
new role and duties I think that
we're kind of cleaning up some
of those.
Distinction having some stations
that were really there before so
thank you for reading thank you.
Representative right.
Madam chairman of.
Dear Tate.
One of the things that the
commission did hello it is
but it went out Representative
the first of the.
Get doubled with the order of
non consensual those.
And I know you won't have
jurisdiction to rule over here
but I'd like for you to work
with the PRC
Members can review that let me
explain and we're talking about.
One eight one eight exported
health workers so if you look in
the phone book.
Sensual tow is about forty five
dollars see my part of the work
that needed to do.
Nonconsensual codes or codes
where you've been involved in
a traffic crash or something
like that.
Nonconsensual toes before the
change that was a hundred
dollars just to get there.
Then they have hookup fees and
all this other stuff.
So they took those fees of basic
non consensual trove from about
two hundred to four hundred.
the person insurance you know
full coverage that goes to the
insurance but you start looking
at individuals we're this is our
only car really.
So
you know I was talking to some
of of record companies to the
record companies and they were
saying you know this is so wrong
we're going to do it.
And and technically the right
violation if they don't.
this is something we need to
correct right right.
The madam chair and senator DOT
who stay in force what the
towing regulations.
Will open until the transfer
date your symptoms what we up
but
and shared Senator in the future
is it going to go to law
enforcement to go in and forces
or you go to reinforce that
house it was going to go chair
representative of we anticipate
will enforce and the the issue
that you're talking specifically
has been fighting for us adding
to some of the costs that listed
this the associated with that
releasing the vehicle from there
you all right to talk about the
P. C. get it there but these are
also going to do something just
to get released on top of all
that closed in flight but
through rural the department
transportation right.
Unfortunately the issue is
license to practice
some of the changes that come to
mind by the in the appeal
Education of some of those
issues rather than floating to a
commission those with this
comment and with the
administrative authority for the
secretary from.
Madam chair and and when we're
done with all the in the hall
and talk to the council of the
issues
I think this is very good what
has happened with PRC is a have
one investigator.
And so or if one time they have
to.
And that was for all of.
R. P. Garcia if they came up
with a violation legislative
towing company they can't even
agree upon a font but they could
let me that fine until we had a
PRC meeting specifically on that
subject.
So consequently nothing ever
happened.
And
yeah which you I have some
passed legislation the one with.
As well.
Anyway madam chair.
Senator yeah this needs to be
done I agree thank you thank
you.
Thank you committee members
Representative blocked madam
chair I move it to pass second
have a motion for the past seven
seconds a I don't see any
opposition opposition the show
all present voting in the
affirmative and senator.
Senator Wirth since his regrets
Mr.
I
you for calling the press
office.
Hey I see this.
Senator Munoz to.
I texted you.
She is.
On our way.
Neil fixin to okay no response
per usual.
Hey Ivey Soto.
Of the staff.
In terms of the committee on
health services clerk
And Senator Ortiz Y. Pino
happens I.
the issue of racially
restrictive covenants in its so
that news did a news article
about two years ago and ensure
that for attendees still have
the iterations language refer
to.
The recording documents they're
not later on those documents and
allowing language to carry for
concessions Senator Ivey Soto
we also noticed that there is a
disk for upcoming comes to of
these documents and gender so
what we see that we were asked
about their single status.
They're not supposed to be asked
of anyone is schools and how
a single status
married or unmarried also forms
need and so this bill not only
is attempting to make sure
there's a disclaimer the people
who have iterations for two
documents can do without it but
also to at to make sure that
mortgage documentation to ensure
they're not as for apple.
Women about their marital status
in patients getting a mortgage.
Senator request.
Okay with the audience do we
have any members of the audience
who would like to speak in
support of the bill.
In opposition.
Okay Sir.
Chair members of the committee
thank you very much.
As far as the Santa Fe county
commission to support this
resolution thanks for the
program.
Okay let's go to the webcast do
we have any comments thank you
for the bill and opposition CNN
committee this.
Senator Zamora.
Representative law and
Representative happen.
Thank you.
Thank.
I'm sorry.
Been here before and Roger named
after class yes.
So miss Clark Senator.
What is the problem with that be
there and why do we have to go
through all this process.
from what I understand there's
been a Supreme Court ruling is
not affecting anybody anywhere
correct and.
Chair so the issue is that when
someone who is the targeted
group so for instance if you
were a Asian descent and will
provide property documents are
presented to you as if the
covenants are not enforceable so
there's no misleading language I
can barely of Science because
first time property to see if
the property provisionally when
the housing was that did not
allow those of Asian American or
African Americans by housing we
have had this court decision for
over seventy years and finer
folks for not putting a
disclaimer on the titles and the
duties when the recording them
for they're actually allowing
the racial comments here.
So the idea is that we can't
change history for that mission
of the house the house is known
for school and in fact the legal
from the cares for investing.
Thank you for that answer chair
and.
Catherine has there been any.
basis for is it has affected the
sale of property or somebody.
Representative madam chair I
know that from brought up so
there's been several news
articles about
Those who are homebuyers the
shock troops that by the
The order in the even on
documentation I think that there
are people who cost.
The record there do not have the
language in the answers.
Santa Fe actually some of the
stand houses are very famous in
Santa Fe because of a government
needs to require language in
order to retain the value of the
home they are in all of those
documents and will do just that
are from the stand houses in
Santa Fe County so while housing
is pretty tight here so I don't.
Necessarily not my home I think
that would be allowed to just
continue out in this world or.
Language that says this is not
for Social continues to be a
problem Madam chair.
So madam chair and.
Catherine so then.
If somebody buys a house.
This is language we right to be
in a they don't take that
long for the day in the process
it depends chair representative
of the time so what we're saying
is that it depends on title
companies practices sometimes
accompanies do for the
disclaimer saying referring back
to oil companies of for the
housing but there are certain
things that housing this non
forcible
other title companies as we saw
from the Larry Barker storey or
the US high country news some
companies are carrying that
language for that committee with
you madam chair.
Madam chair and Catherine what
what will be the process of this
bill.
Takes hold.
And signed by the government.
R. J..
So the process will be that if
there is a iterations from.
Through.
That because then we'll we will
be dropped.
When when the property over the
last.
We are revisions of the.
We do allow property owner once
we record.
Some people are.
Defense of.
Other than otherwise.
these are only those that deal
with.
Forces race religion national
origin.
or other access roads.
There's some long T..
No more than seven James said.
The.
The architecture style for
example the Santa Fe right so
what companies.
This is a useful purpose.
The ones that I'm awful.
Try.
Today and and madam chair and
senator I.
Of the.
I said if I didn't want anybody
no shoes so.
And at the same time send.
Yes.
Okay I I think that concludes my
questions a madam chair.

The so.
Our service is a state to arrive
in.
So this is with the state to
heights Act.
Violation of human rights.
The.
Using the state to Rights Act.
For this purpose in New Mexico.
Senator Sanchez different from
other states.
Is.
The primary purpose of the Human
Rights Act is to seek
conciliation.
So that somebody continually
violates this.
And therefore the direct
commission.
The resolution them.
The.
This eight the loss was work are
you good with that and this is a
yes.
Association doesn't open for.

Los.

is property.
Which is a budget.
Okay thank you madam chair and
senator yes I'm reading this on
online eleven assists Committee
or other instrument of writing
Madam chair Senator what could
this other instruments the.
It could be.
It could be a transfer on death
deed.
Up it could be
As of right decisions related to
property thank you record
stipends the state.
Current thank you madam chair
and senator if so then.
Regarding these deeds do we
know.
The number of.
Localities or number of do that
are out there that may not be in
compliance with this current
language we're trying to update
madam chair Senators so we have
universes.
With our the rest of this
article documents.
But it is not particular work
even the most recent iteration.
The ones as far.
I don't know the exact numbers
of each.
However I have.
Representative madam chair high.
A review of December the report
Bernalillo county clerk's
offices and twenty twenty that
four out of ten of the language
Terry for.
So from yes so there are
in Bernalillo county New Mexico
Albuquerque there are
neighborhoods that are losses in
low light your roots that have a
iterations secretary documents
and those have higher frequency
of the.
The language for.
Madam is.
The house.
After World War two.
At the discretion.
Education.
Campaign to.
Thank you madam chair and
senator so.
Is my understanding that
currently these the.
This antiquated language with a.
Not being findings still madam
chair.
Is there by the defense.
Thank you madam chair but it
wouldn't change the purpose of
the the act is not in compliance
with this new make history.
Okay thank you madam chair and
senator so then this would I
guess what I'm saying is is that
this is kind of like a.
Giving an opportunity for people
if they don't additional life
award in there do to be able to
change that to be in compliance
Or
the work that are included in
this yes occuring actors are.
You madam chair Senator so then.
What are the administrative.
Costs regarding this Madam chan
Senator.
Person and the.
The one that has to pay those
costs madam chair yes
Representative brunch I want to.
Is that because.
But there's no harm it's we
recorded.
Mr cost.
And in fact.
Hi this is out of this line we.
It doesn't.
Just look the same.
It's.
Really very elegant solution
that we worked on that land
taxation.
Thank you madam chair and
senator and then what about
historic documents madam chair
Senator let's just say this is
an old the from eighteen sixty
eight cases that in there but if
it is stored document manager
and.
Those are historical records.
We will not just those.
We will not admit those are all
part of the past.
Thank you madam chair and
senator so Madam chair Senator
to streamline else's here and it
says it prohibits the use of
gender specific references and
he's managed care center what
kind of gender specific
references are we talking about
so often.
Of our state.
Property.
References to.
Right.
This.
Percent by.
However.
What.
This is what happens.
This.
So it should.
The state.
Bill right.
I suspect.
Little house single woman I
suspect.
The state.
The reason is expressing more
merit.
Right.
It
Our.
Okay madam chair.
So the only talking about
minerals that Madam chair with
the gender specific language.
Representative what we're seeing
is that the.
District meeting held DEC
thirteen two these mortgages are
being treated differently is
around the issue merrier on
merry the very close and very
thing access you can't ask about
single status and yet many of
the forms we see in the office
include single female status so
what we're asking for is that
the change that took place
around Meryl status and find
buying property because as you
may know women even with the
same credit scores I call this
the financial information to
get loans the state right.
The service is something we're
trying to make is to see if or
at least try to.
Show light on that there is
still this for outcomes and
disparate treatment particularly
on merry went out to buy a and
so we wanted to change the forms
Representative manager okay
thank you madam chair and
senator and madam clerk so these
forms these templates we're
talking about.
Who is the one that.
That creates them promulgate
them get them out then Senator.
Chair of the law the.
Please.
Storms the is the the the banks
have of course.
And I just need somebody to make
a change.
The law.
Okay thank you madam chair and
senator so they're already like
case law saying that you cannot
discriminate based on these
individual.
Factors chair Senator chair
representative there is.
Based on this but doesn't change
the fact that a the site was so
the carrier forward and be.
The general station is still
out.
Thank you madam chair and
senator so have there been any
lawsuits regarding the lack of
changes in these templates madam
chair some.
Chair representative will have
to have not been we find out the
dice are wrapped.
I'm doing it this way.
Thank you madam chair and
senator so let's just say
there's a template out there
right now.
And they go against K. fun Act
not actual law.
Chair Senator what if an
individual decides to a project
to entering that information due
to the fact that is
discriminatory etcetera etcetera
with the individual then.
Not be able to get a loan or not
be able to get a title matches
in the so.
There's a big staff this
position sign on the way
fortunately.
What's this all right let's us
on that when the state well
that's just stated.
That's the answer.
All yeah I got that when I
bought my house madam chair
Senator and I did not read every
single page so on this the
fortunately Madam chair Senator
so if you would individuals know
that they would be signs that
was not in compliance with.
Whatever the standard is that
we're making.
If Madam chair Senator.
They're like a hundred pages
like we said.
Chair of the office all forms
first.
Through the nineteen seventies.
And honestly not a ton save has
ever since.
Okay thank you madam chair and
the Senator so do we know that
like around the country this has
been a problem I I don't think
there's been lawsuits here in
state Madam chair Senator have
there been problems regarding
this antiquated language in
other states close New Mexico
Representative madam chair so
this is actually something that
what we're seeing in Senator
clear national park
organizations around
Representative report and so
this is a discussion on record
recording officers essentially
all over the country for
bringing this to the
legislature's to talk about the
fact that typically when the
record oculus our job is just to
focus on.
Profit from knowledge you know
ways of saying what is on those
documents are jobs to be the
reporting officer this is a
movie all over the country to
remove language that should have
been removed eighty years ago
and it's also something that is
in discussions around the fact
that we're still seeing women
versus nine how do you
differential treatment when it
comes to applying to workers's
and hope home loans under the
fair credit Act so this is not
you know we are not the first
certainly not the first state
that would be doing this we
would do serve in the the pack
of having these discussions
around the country trying to
resolve the position where the
reporters tend to to do their
job which is.
Probably not document it also
point out the fact that
facetiously since should simply
not be there and their needs to
either be a disclaimer for not
care for the leadership to carry
for and also bring up the fact
that you're still seeing
differential outcomes when it
comes to of treatment of gender
and getting credit for housing
chairperson okay thank you madam
chair thank you Senator and
madam clerk so then my next
question is regarding the Human
Rights Act Madam chair Senator I
know we just amended it in a
bill that's going through the
legislature council two of seven
Senator Senator.
With this in any way.
Chains what if that bill is
doing or with that bill teens
with your goes to any kind of
care center.
Chair representative locked I'm
to others.
Okay thank you madam chair and
senator.
And then regarding the.
The analysis madam chair
Senator.
or the FIR to significant issues
the AG's has racially
discriminated governments
working to legal nationwide by
the passage of the fair housing
act of nineteen sixty eight and
then says madam chair Senator
it's been reported in the media
that many deeds in Albuquerque
for example stepped in recent
restrictive covenants chair
Senators I just want to know the
states that have recently
restrictive covenants are they
anyway.
Let's just say I was a person of
a race that was committed
against in the D. and I I have
the right now.
Chair Senator currently on this
the.
And money breaking any covenants
by owning this T. by figuration
property that is because against
in the self chair representative
Lockyer not the nice thing about
this bill is it would allow you
to then go underground and re
record job gains and remove that
language which I think is a very
important thing to power people
skills do that.
Up there are members of the
state house representatives
whose homes.
Say that they should not live in
the house.
Thank you madam chair thank you
senator and we certainly
wouldn't want that would we and
I appreciate the answers madam
chair senator and clears some
stuff up for me I appreciate.
A lot of complicated legal stuff
but is that something testing.
Representative Hochman Vigil
thank you very much madam chair
and thank you Senator personal
projects for making use.
It makes me feel incredibly
guilty.
So my apologies for that
Madam chair Senator madam clerk
so.
Everybody hates restrictive
covenants.
Everybody agrees that they
should that language is
offensive it should not be there
I think everybody is on the same
page they're not not an issue I
think after reading the bill
several times myself and
speaking to some is that
practice exclusively real estate
law I just talked a lot of
questions as to the process
thank you revision
as as to how this work exactly
so my first question is for you
to
carry forward means like what is
that.
Four.
Is not the.
So it's just simply that this is
language let's see if there's
language that was in the bill
are an additional homes with
those bills.
Seven.
It's been sold six times.
And it also so those are the
property it continues to say no
person of Mexican ancestry or
the Negro race may live on the
property unless it serves our
which is how a lot of these over
the.
So I'm madam chair Senator.
You have your the title
recording process works normally
are there it's their job to
record the deed right I mean
this loss yes so so it does
madam chair senator Kerr do you
envision this bill creating a
our obligation for clerks to
start reviewing these types of
documents to is what will they
have an obligation to report if
they see anything I mean what's
the process there
Representative madam chair so
these were very careful about
that and you said may to make
sure that close to not
necessarily feel obligated to
Lack any restrictive covenants
we're hoping that some people
are finding this out and having
talked at length to the title
companies association that they
will simply American members do
this and you sort of find out
some of the language that
receiving Kerry or most
companies do not do this but
there are certain ones that to
but I don't create some nations
on the on the job for the county
clerk to because of the NMAA
rather than the shop to each
okay.
Thank you thank you madam chair
for for for hearing from me
another so I'm disruption to
specifically involved in the new
material and so you know no
deterrent aspirational basement
if you're part of our workers
County contains covenants
language that meets the
description section and.
Okay right find makes a lot of
sense
but then there but but then you
also state later in paragraph do
you have this optional language
so are you there.
There right now Mr covenants
are.
Regional by Supreme Court law
they may not be used or carry
forward as this language that
you raising.
But based on this process is
it like just don't do it for you
can do it but submit this
language.
With it so madam chair and
representative of the the
service is.
Was that they were gonna have to
go back and review the very
first.
The of every single problem.
So that so so those for those.
So we hackers are those sixty
percent.
Where the language is not
prepared for what it's is
struggling.
Then instead of making them go
do that research I did.
I don't find it there subject to
some kind of liability.
What we did is we
Representative.
What I am This slide.
The brothers labor for the.
Okay Madam chair Senators then I
have that same I actually I'm
married to a very detail
oriented attorney resolved and
he actually did go through every
word and find our house.
Garcia so that we have a certain
covenants and withdraw our
tenants are homeowners
association we have restrictive
covenants and in our governance
and so is it then if I want to I
can go take a copy of my deed I
have it re recorded with that
language can I just I'd have to
put this paragraph I just report
it without the language Here
Representative Hochman Vigil
you.
Okay so the more we giving
wiring in the people that are
I'm sorry madam chair Senator
worriedly options to include
this language we still do it
chair representative on the of.
to help companies process.
A lot of documents.
I really don't know what to do
for the thank.
And.
But but they were
they they didn't want to be in a
position.
Actual research.
The visual the of every single.
But Madam chair Senator
respectfully I think that the
answers my question like what is
the what are they supposed to do
what is the obligation to re
record without language or do
you have this paragraph and then
we would just.
So for the chair representative
after the other certainly if
fate and fate
If indeed.
K. label says we cared for.
That way we should drops.
Okay yes.
That drop.
Right.
Is that we care for the
environment people go look I so
they could extinguish.
Specifically think of this.
Okay I'm madam chair Senator so
I'm I'm a little concerned
knowing what I know about really
about property law in the
recording process and a chain of
title.
Especially as it relates to like
subdivisions with.
Hundreds of houses.
Where are you are you going
today and have because there's
also some language in here that
we'll talk about the second
about anybody can afford to pay
the financial interest and what
that means
are we creating a situation
where me and my husband can just
go.
Without the knowledge of the
rest of our subdivision re
record our deed without that
language and then and then we
are our team will be mismatched
with the rest of the deeds Act
because some also contain those
covenants.
Some will not.
And so you know the also you
have a subdivision with two
hundred houses in it with two
hundred do and say two hundred
different thing.
How I mean that's a problem is.
Madam chair representative
hopefully health to Senator
using that that that will work
the levy is racially restrictive
language.
I have a problem.
Okay thank you madam chair
senator so just as long as it is
related to the fact that it's
this language that everybody
hates.
We don't care that we have two
hundred.
Mismatched beeps.
That's correct okay I want to go
to the last.
Representative T..
Any person within ownership or
financial interest in the
property may at any time we
recorded due to such properties
of the deep conform to the
requirements of this section
what is ownership or financial
interest.
You need.
Chair representative.
I have a mortgage.
Some interest in my house.
One paid off iota.
Okay madam chair Senator so
again that leads me back to my
concern about.
Two hundred different needs
to one thousand two hundred sets
of language which the whole I
thought point of chain of title
was to have uniformity and to
research I think I mean this is
going to make title Madam chair
Senator the title companies will
actually be doing something to
earn their money if we.
And and and me into this is a
lot you know so I I I understand
what you're trying to do like I
said nobody everybody's
restrictive covenants they need
to go Terrel are with.
terrible I experience review
found to come in and and and the
but.
Just a little concerned with the
process might my last question
madam chair Senator more I the
gendered language stuff.
Late I get that too but is
active and that's just caring
for right are we are we also
going to treat gender languages
and we were treating restrict.
So madam chair and
Representative Hochman Vigil.
I am.
I hope you feel that right now
hi.
Well.
Hi I am not aware of.
The.
That indicate that the.
I would say.
That this house state over the
if I may.
Justice.
And so the gender specific
language.
Of
the in covenants or improper
this description.
But instead it tends to appear
elsewhere in language that is
more theoretical and that is
specific to that transaction.
Okay.
madam chair Senator.
Second the last question.
I know we're talking about how
the judges can somehow fact
person's ability to get credit
are on the house I'm kids.
Perhaps you can explain to me.
Representative manager shinning
I'm sorry the language we're
talking about gendered language
and you had said something about
how it may at of how it affects
credit or may affect credit or a
person's ability to purchase the
house and I just kind of wanted
to do thank you
Elucidate that for me
Representative manager so what
we see in the mortgage forms is
that they're asking about Ingle
status.
For a moment you're not allowed
to ask you're single for a lot
to ask if you are merry primary
or with that's it and so we are
seeing forms that essentially
violate what that fair credit
access
so unless we say something it's
just going to keep going and
that is the point of that law
essentially to recognize that
women are being treated
differently madam chair
representative I'm asking to
simply make it persons rather
than women or men so that the.
The by behavior that receive one
they're asking a little bit the
status
We would not continue to see in
the market segments that our
career cross.
The.
Thank you madam chair members
part but this bill has nothing
to do this there's no language
in this bill telling title
companies the language in to
include honor forms right.
It's simply a matter
Representative manager it's
simply that
Instead of dictating specifics.
Just make them gender neutral
essentially the forms that keep
the template forms that we keep
seeing over and over and our
office Representative manager
thank you madam chair I'm sorry
for really bad someone conclude
replicate
but I think that the here's to
madam Kirk I got over it so I'm
like you're listening to.
Madam chair Senator right you
know like I said.
Know what I mean everybody
agrees with you a process needed
to be put together to get rid of
this offensive language hundred
percent agree on not I'm just a
little concerned that we might
be
title are here in the way and
and chain of title and how we
treat that in in the legal world
so I'm I'm gonna vote for the
bill that I would highly
encourage you to think about
that and kind of maybe go
through the bill and clarify
some of those processes this but
maybe in the promulgation of
rules but but yeah I just at
those are just some questions I
have so thank you madam chair.
Madam chair representative.
Portions of this bill that deal
with operation restrictive
covenants.
The land title association.
Work with us on those then they
did approve that process.
Thank you madam chair center
it's good to know thank you
thank you Representative little
and then Representative Zamora
Representative three chair with
the two please okay we have a
motion motion representatives.
Madam chair and senator.
Order elector testimony law
which brought up.
What happens.
If somebody decides.
To build.
A.
I thank the lord gated community
here certain areas.
Or just certain they just want
certain gender to live there.
Madam chair and representative
of our that would be against
federal law the person that
would be able to get mortgage to
be able to look into that that.
Okay so they can put any kind of
language into the.
The governments to to do that
that's because it's federal yes.
Well then that brings us back
full circle.
And the federal law now.
So anybody is allowed to take
out this language if they want
to anyway madam chair listens
more
a
mission to take language out a
no it's not operable image they
don't feel like they can remove.
That's.
Chair Senators of is this gonna
add one more paper that stack of
papers.
Chair and representative of our
well at to.
Four lines to that staff
compared
to what's so madam chair and
senator but it'll be on a
separate page on
Thursday and on the some yes I
will be able to support.
Thank you.
Thank you so.
Right the chair and senator in
and of
Cap on the when we go to the
page.
And
One five and we talked about
that for gender specific
language.
And I didn't quite understand
Sir you're saying.
That they can was it a you know
it's kind of state a person what
would credit goes to an
individual.
So I wonder what we're trying to
fix their.
Chair representative what we're
trying to fix.
Is is the equity that happens
in one place.
There was at go right.
A married man.
But they don't they single
right.
And then they say Alan.
A very will.
Well are you gonna call her out
for being removed another call
you up for the amendment.
Welcome.
Yeah I I think we need to move
on.
Madam part of the school's back
there was a time when a woman
could not buy a house.
By yourself well as a man
countersigned.
For that house.
And this is a vestige of those
days that no longer exists so
let's please go over the line.
Yeah Madam chairman and senator
I was just like I mean I didn't
make the connection about you
still have to go to the bank or.
Company whatever and they know
exactly who you are and they do
exactly what your marital
statuses Jack you know so I was
all of that out anyway I want to
move on in I think that this was
as
of madam chair and senator so
right now you're saying the
county clerks and I went and I
said I wanted to leave this
language on my the they would be
able to do that I have chair
representative right that's
cool.
This is permission to do that
and madam chair and senator.
I and I thought that you could
go into the county clerk and
facing file anything.
That's not true chair
representative right that is
that is true.
Conversation with the modern us
about thirty minutes.
Yes if you're going and just
possibly.
Hello I.
The question is what value would
have would have the status if
you did underground without
this.
Well madam chair and senator I
wanted I took my need and I just
deleted all that language off of
that I would need to do.
I've done what this bill with a
copy issues and I don't even
talk to them I say here's my
date I want to update my deep
here this.
you madam chair Representative
Rehm again the question is what
legal consequences of that
activity.
Going forward.
They issued also though and as
far as you can have one seven
seconds.
But you still have some
chickens.
Well.
Madam chairman and senator we
all know this is the the legal
you know.
By the Supreme Court decision
from the sixties so.
Sixty years of.
I mean I did not want to go
ahead and build a subdivision
with covenants of such as this
and I agree the shift in the you
know was make it clear.
But of.
you know sometimes we have stuff
we're we're kind of like.
In search of a of a problem.
That I think I can go would I
change might be I would and be
done and I mean us the court is
going to challenge what I filed
so.
And no one's gonna come assuming
and go well you can put that
language act spoke anyway we
move on Madam chair of page nine
paragraph the.
So.
This tells you gotta prepare
this instrument what's the if
you don't.
Madam chair representative
right.
The first is the work is part
could reject.
The card is not required to
look.
And in most cases the current
one hundred percent.
Madam chair representative
right.
Up at some point though somebody
could fall complied with the
Human Rights Commission.
So that they could probably
educate the folks he gets
conciliation on that issue.
So madam chair and senator goes
back to my previous question the
clerk didn't know looks we're
going to file it so someone got
soul Rights Commission files one
eight.
What's going to happen them.
Madam chair representative right
this'll the the.
Wishes of our father.
Conversation and if you agree
all the action happens both of
these are they which
conciliation and these are fine.
If not then it becomes more
important.
But but that's the great thing
about the right second we have.
Not like animals.
Where where the goal is
conciliation.
Thank you madam chair and chair
just just what we really just
try to find the least
administratively.
burdens waited to.
And we found we try to find the
the most
The easiest Enforcement process
where we were brandishing
anybody with anything given the
first opportunity to say oh yeah
that's right okay.
That's what we're after.
And madam chair and senator was
served an incident or something
came forward prop this.
Okay maybe I missed that
Senator.
Mr Chairman said Representative
ring yeah I I can I can bring
that up because of the Larry
Barker contacted me and said
you're supposed to be this very
progressive the Human Rights
oriented.
Legislators have you let your
details property and I said well
if I had never look at that is
discredited and it said this
property cannot be sold to
Chinese or or negroes.
And just I had no idea that was
in there and any so what what
are you gonna do this is a you
know the film for what it is.
And I said I am going to contact
Daniel A. Ivey Soto.
It's so that's sort of.
That's how it will turn into it
and he said that this was not
the typical you know three day
then on the subject in the state
and a couple used to figure out
what we can do about this and so
this is the result of that.
Chair Senators I agree I have
not read the.
The staff like that these folks
but you know I would
if I read it myself that I would
be going what.
Is but.
Anyway.
Okay thank you Representative
Chasey madam chair Senators.
I just don't get it in the
science I wonder if we should
call the Larry Parker law.
Shares in senators.
If this passes are the title
companies.
Could it is indeed now have
chair and Representative Chasey
in and all that some of them are
occurring going forward because
it's in the property
description.
And others it's and it's a
separate covenant list of
comments that were originally
with the property.
And so it all depends on how it
was late at.
Madam chairman and senators I am
one of our colleagues is an
expert in this area and he said
that the racial covenants have
appeared to diss over fifty
years.
And
That they are not in the major
cities it seems to me that the.
Title companies ought to be.
Told we've got a change of point
madam chair that Supreme Court
decision.
With this.
It doesn't seem.
This to make sense
Representative Chasey this us.
As you mentioned forms.
And can you.
madam chair and senator sent and
witcher would this be able to
give an example of restrictive
covenants that have been filed
in Santa Fe New Mexico last
twenty by thirty years share all
of all of this one I give you
the second one was on last
year's.
And that is your neighbor for
brought.
And of the the D. two at home.
As their side of the document
sent relations.
Is.
Yes that's it's not is the
majority for what it did so.
Is very personal to a lot of.
I I madam chair and not
defending restrictive covenants
by a long shot but.
I'm.
I'm not sure how it will affect
it seems like the industry is
the title industry and that I am
in a carry the bill for.
Madam chair years ago to remove
To have gender neutral language
in statutes and nobody wanted to
go back and change them all
because that would be
an incredible amount of work but
all the New Orleans.
Are gender neutral and with it
all sections lost being amended
its change right so.
Sure word Madam chair
representative she's just
approach to this.
No
Some people do just a for sale
by owner.
The other people who were
submitting to imported.
This is a process that that that
was very documents.
Who are options the solution of
those comments shop.
We would not be prepared.
Chairman.
Okay.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you senator last last point
station one twenty two no
discrimination and it
because this is the paragraph
that we're stepping on to the
state this this plan the really
the whole intent of this is to
be added to all these documents
as their period forward to state
clearly that that is correct
which is buoyant that's the
super important piece
I think you really should
include what you have at the top
of page nine and what you added
to the Rights Act and
specifically left what kind of
discrimination you're talking
about race religion national
origin protected class because
it doesn't say that and I think
it's important to say that that
you decided that a floor
amendment you want to do madam
chair and senator for ship that.
Thank you with that we have a
motion for to pass the
Representative second by
Representative on.
Hello.
Representative on in order yes

Senate bill two eight six.
Yes please so thanks again I
appreciate bill
what you're trying to do here I
have some real reservations and
heartburn that we are possibly
creating some unintentional bad
public policy so I would very
strapped strongly highly
encourage you to maybe work with
one of us to do to just take
care of a couple of these things
so that we can have a strong.
Thank you very quickly we're
going to go to.
Senate joint resolution thirteen

the Senate joint resolution

legislature's sale of the state

exciting for a lot of us in the
value we want to do is use the
story appears to go to a
that was a handicap for school

As well as extra parking and
can't emphasize enough how big
of a part of the life of my

Senate joint resolution

Sure I make a motion that we
bring Senate bill sixty three
it's kind of what we both bring
it up and make it the next order
of business and I think I have
an amendment that would fix some
of the
opposition to.
Senate bill sixty three seven
Williams is here.
Any other.
The those.
And we have has the.
Is everybody had their.
Yes okay in the two number yes.
It is two two six.

They were moving the amendment

The the amendment.
Thank you.
Committee.
this and does so.
Three things you want to change
the title
to include.
The amendment.
Approved by this committee last
session.
The changes.
Home page one twenty three
changes three I is two of five
finalists.
In the one hundred twenty four.
Changes.
The US and three.
Listen I was if you deem that
could maybe on the floor that
you really want to.
The state is with.
this.
In the sense
to bring and I if you.
I feel that this is only
for.
Session.
So that the the member and chair
we are.
The question
questions on the mend.
Thank you madam chair and
senator did we speak to
stakeholders who are concerns
directly about the tracking this
commitment and.
And what did they say in
response to.
Thank you for the question or
if.
We.
For.
Expert witness.
The office of the.
Of Nikki Estes.
Officials all of your expert
witness
There are a number of
discussions I representatives of
the people in the form.
Representative into your
particular.
Interface with that did not
yield that compromise they would
sign off on those possible.
I tried.
Show sympathy for their concerns
I I will say to that a little
bit different than your question
but that Representative little
in some ways expired this as a
whole.
Okay she raised concerns about
of that we had different kinds
of public entities here we had
some very small going up to APS
very large and how could we
insist that they all come up
necessarily with the state
number of finalists and we
thought about how to deal with
that and wound up with this
asking everybody to.
Sure I but if they're willing to
actually certified I consider
very serious business the store
if I choose to come up with
something that works for the
position of that they could go
with just before they realize
that it's kind of a formal thing
I assumed this over last night
because we only had.
And this over to the people from
the group the government but I
have not heard.
I do have her email said.
Thank you madam chairman Senator
said we speak with the New
Mexico press association if they
had concerns they're sort of all
together the R. E. L. A. I I
spoke of on the phone actually
with the.
Gentleman from the general there
were three of the city here the
lady of the two gentlemen and I
spoke to the one of the general
fund and he was in touch with
the other percent I said I I
didn't he didn't get any email
that I will email to the this
majors for Paul and that's what
I did so I think all in the loop
they currently chose not to come
this.
Well yeah.
Committee chair senator I just
guess I didn't know that the
is beyond the scheduled for this
morning.
Senator Senator I guess we I
don't believe that they probably
at the time and notice to get
here person to what we do as I
chair Senators so.
You know just for that reason I
don't think I could support the
bill I could support the
amendment but I don't think it's
for the families thank you.
Thank you Representative Hochman
Vigil is next thank you Mr chair
thank you senator morning thank
you for the amendment I think
this is
I think you are really trying to
kind of.
Just some of the issues that
were brought about this bill I
was maybe you could just give me
a little more detail of what is
supposed to happen if I
candidates don't appear which in
New Mexico I think would
probably be a common occurrence
for some of these higher
detailed you know higher
requirements professional
positions.
Thank you.
Chair for the questions.
Understand if they don't.
Don't is less than madam chair
Senator if I people don't apply.
What happens.
You
chair representative then all of
those people would be candidates
who would be finalists and have
the rest of these religions now
if any one of those was
determined under this to truly
not be suitable I I consider
that a fairly high R. that if
they you know it's not a
question will need to be like
the man by the vote or something
like that if you're really
saying if you don't come up with
I you're really saying we do not
have I individuals who could
serve in this position in our
opinion and the it looks at the
county commissions they would
have to vote and certified to
that effect on the record of the
minutes of the county we could
not come up with I Wirth
presently suitable and that's a
pretty serious thing but then
you would go with a four three
whoever you had and their names
with the rules okay thank you
madam chair as I said earlier
the.
Representative this million
sensitive you favor the
intentions of our.
It's unethical to bring somebody
in for interactive them the fuel
late madam chair.
can be seen okay is.
And Representative Rehm Madam I
move adoption of the second.
I'm gonna ask a question first
visit their piece of the
amendment that you don't really
need
Madam chair the center if you go
to page to learn to if you I am
concerned candidates for the
position because that is the
minimum qualification so if you
would and I have the minimum
qualification that means to the
viruses you and I are making the
finalists I think you're item
number three on the amendment is
not necessary because I think
it's covered on the two lines
two through five.
If fewer than I am is that the
minimum qualifications that
means they're not suitable for
the position which is what you
have in the amendment three I
think you need that part.
Madam chair members food.
I think you are doing on that
point Representative will.
Is that.
I think that what are three
contains wasn't in previous
amended is the certification.
But body would you say that's
right.
This one centered.
You madam chair center
Representative yes.
That was serious as of.
Mr just to so that's a really
serious so that.
To the public.
Senator.
Madam chair and senator
Representative certification
what to whom and how.
What does that need that means
standing up and saying.
These so we only have three
double for the position.
We only have three finalists.
This is this I think.
The service is good example of
like a county commissions about
so if you just want to
elaborate.
Thank you madam chair.
Seven percent the.
Question you're asking of this
someone who are group
individuals get certified.
No madam chair and senator it's
said is.
The fewer finalist needs and
resumes go publicly available if
it's survivors that it has
concluded that the non disclosed
applicants are not suitable for
the position is actually they're
saying.
We don't have I find this only
three are super.
For the position and I think
that.
Certifying that it has concluded
that there are only three
finalists means standing up and
saying it and.
Of the certified motion
licenses.
The.
Committee made up of.
People who either from the.
Outside or.
Session.
Selected to.
This is the.
Individuals to interview.
Make a formal recommendation to
the.
Free elected by if this is
included we think should.
So madam and today is.
Of the.
Sure my expert witness wants to
add to.
Wesley I just.
I was.
Madam chair.
Reserve the committee
representative I I I would just
say of some of us at the border
like this mortar county
commission free not just the
service by somebody that the
federal government that they've
done certain things to get pods
first thing
and so this is for David
survived to the public the food
on the record of both they would
stand up informally said.
This is we have look into this
committee agreed maybe there's a
committee as policy just as
recommended and given that the
the county commission would have
to say we accept that
recommendation we are only three
and we certify that all stalled
voting for that.
Okay thank you madam chair thank
you senator for the
clarification request we have a
motion to have a draft of the
amendment yes.
and I wanted to see with this
ammendment at I was looking at
the
I didn't receive

the state's name one services
department of the health care
forty.
Thank you for powers and duties.
And provide for transitioning
from for impulsive person money
appropriations record the
purpose of life and public
property if you is is is to get
all of our health care
programs under the state
department information it's a
really I mean there's a lot of
these are one of the main
reasons that we have so we do
have a few that are yes yes the
public schools affect state
worker and all those kind of
insurances and.
Here so it to give them more
power to negotiate lower prices
for.
One of the.
I have respect for the
Representative former
Representative Deborah A.
Armstrong
Awfully I let someone else pay
for.
Madam chair and members of the
committee also have
our acting secretary
Department.
carrier Niko and the secretary
for health he's secretary
Alan.
This really is and madam chair
members of the committee on of
during the session on doing some
contract work and health policy
for the which is fine sitting
here that's important
Establishing a single unified
department responsible for
health care purchasing.
Regulation and.
policy that
will be foundation for more
effective management and
oversight healthcare.
by leveraging that purchasing
power.
and coordination and yes
will lead to more organized
health care system that would
deliver greater integration
better access to care improved
performance.
the health care authority should
it will be the convening agency
I'm getting the major parts of
the system to work together to
deliver something better for New
Mexico.
This is
The bill is I just a framework
for what did what divisions in
other departments as a whole
division would move over to the
new department of Medicaid is
already there behavioural health
is already there slide reading
the Human Services Department.
some modifications and then
during your own will really be
to planning.
Of of one other programs and
what's the phase and would be
what is to move first what all
has to be done it's a big
undertaking
We are.
Government to bring it together
but.
One of the
yes
This is also in bringing the
purchasing of the in fiscal
Easton retirees that is now
working in white collar I acted
in rural interagency
Purchasing is been pretty
ineffective when it was
developed years ago it was part
of the answer for.
Bring together.
To this effort is in power so
they really operate
independently of each other and
have not done.
And there was a LFC report.
or review of the are agencies
yours ago Senate.
Committee for anyone remembers
that I.
Hello where they talked about
the ineffectiveness of are you
using that power.
They concluded LFC concluded
that the best way to address.
Issue of rising healthcare costs
is there consolidation of the
individual agencies into a state
health care purchasing
organization with wide decision
making authority and that's what
this.
And
when we're coming out of turn it
over to the other tax rates of
this method of reorganization
with the this is what we're
going to do these are the big
pieces that are going to move
and others were of other many
discrete programs you're going
to figure out what's going to
come back with a more fully
develop transition plans and any
necessary
provided changes to effectuate
yes.
Is a weight numerous departments
have been created
we don't often create
departments or reorganized but I
think they go for off.
During my time.
Involvement in state government
which is the aging and long term
Services Department the Indian
Affairs Department the cultural
affairs department of Veterans
Affairs program were all created
this way with one this
legislation saying do that come
back.
And then the next year they came
back with a more complete
transition plan and authorizing
statute so that
the model for our for our
putting this together so with
that off.
I.
Okay did you want to make any
comments or to the sure thank
you madam chair and members of
the committee good morning.
I I think you know I just want
to say that I think that
consolidating holes agencies
with Medicaid easy makes a lot
of sense are we covered a
hundred and eighty thousand New
Mexicans in Medicaid right now
we can never pass those costs on
to consumers just isn't really
allow and so we are very
creative about how we control
costs we have a lot of skills in
that area on the other seeing
that I want to say is you know
we find probably the most robust
benefit packages recovering all
of long term care the state very
robust behavioral health would
be able to leverage all of those
indications and budget design
to other populations as well
here in New Mexico so that we
can provide more for New
Mexicans and you know I also
think we can deliver more in
terms of measuring the value of
your investment as legislators
so Medicaid we do a lot of
performance measurement we make
sure that kids are getting their
well child tax they're getting
dental visits we can leverage
all of those all of those
performance measures it bring us
the rest of the market here in
New Mexico to sort of.
Prove that were delivering on
your investment and improving
health outcomes for New
Mexicans.
Thank you thank you madam chair
members St Patrick Allen the
security department of health
just quickly in a word this is
really about leverage it's about
consolidating our purchasing
delivery.
And regulation of health care
for the leverage that we get
from that is often easy to think
of cost as the as the reason to
get that leverage but is not the
only it's an important one that
is not the only reason I think
from examples around the country
of these kinds of consolidations
you can see that we can really
get is better outcomes better
outcomes include cost but they
also include access and quality
thank you better health outcomes
and so this bill is a step for
being able to take advantage of
some of those proven tools they
use that leverage to get better.
Thank you now we'll go to the
audience to have comments in
support of the bill.
Comments in opposition.
Webcast.
we're going to hear comments in
support of SB sixteen.
Jennifer go ahead.
That morning chairman and
members of the committee my name
is Jennifer contentious line the
interim superintendent of
insurance I just wanted to rise
and state that the OSI is
supportive of this plan is it'll
be able to look at capturing
policies and coverages that are
not under the regulation of the
west side and provide the state
with the ability to all their
resources for better or better
costs as well as better
negotiated coverage.
Thank you for.
Take Mason go ahead.
And.
Good morning madam chair members
the committee my name is Dick
Mason I'm chair that a member of
the health care committee of the
league of women voters of New
Mexico regular involved as a New
Mexico to support SB sixteen and
thanks to sponsors for bringing
it forward thank you members of
New Mexico has a number of
positions that call for
effective management.
In cost management coordination
of health care physician result
in health care being provided to
a greater number of New Mexico.
SB sixteen pretty infrastructure
in place to accomplish many of
these goals put forward in the
right position so we stand
strong support of SB sixteen
energy to give it to pass I do
want to mention I was co chair
of the Sandoval county health
council one of the forty three
county and tribal health
councils and it's a Beijing
position to see the lack of
coordination of health care as
it comes down to the county and
track the level and I I think
this will be a great step
forward to eliminate some of the
silos of care coming down to the
county and local level so thank
you.
Do we have any comments in
opposition to the bill CNN
Representative Hochman Vigil
thank you very much venture so
the couple questions to learn
more about the plan and the
transition plan do you guys have
an estimated duration or how are
you gonna have to come back for
further legislative approval
what.
Of madam chair and
representative of we will have
to come back for transfer of
budgets and so forth and DFA
will help I put that together
authorizing language
of very statutes will have to
amend amend that as we go
forward.
It's probably going to take I
would assume a couple of years
to fully actually it's a big
deal to move people offices is
not necessarily moved it to the
person budget I. T.
Office space and so forth
people don't necessarily to have
still have to do all that
and when we did aging.
we came back.
With of fully self plan is here
another important factor of my
guess is the.
Four.
Thank you madam chair.
Representative Chasey thank you
madam chair and Wells secretary
knowledge the governor was
really have to.
Into from parties.
Yes.
So I was thinking that would be
helpful is to have a schematic
it shows what what's in HSD now
what's it is G. O. H. and how
it's going to look and another
tire with clear on what the
alternate number of departments
are and what the
The components are divisions
within those departments will be
I was my first.
contact with the states of their
with the state and its
departments was when I'm
directed to community program
and we had a contract with them
health and environment.
So I mean it was.
And with those health
environment separated.
That need.
Very good sense to be and I I
have also developed over the
years madam chair that it's it's
confusing to work with some of
the functions of the department
of health when so many of the
people they serve are on
Medicaid and Medicaid was in the
state so I and I all for taking
this but it might be nice to
have a schematic to look at some
point thank.
More and Representative I think
that's the intent to come back
during the interim as we offer
plans that we have to reflect
the interim committees and have
a full plan before the next
session that would have
identified on that
and an organizational chart kind
of schematic will definitely
help.
You representative
Representative thank you madam
chair
I actually had.
Have had it as some experience
in the through the
administration of federal and
federal and to tribal level of
organizing and consolidating in
this manner it is quite involved
and
I have been quite involved but
the budget I saw that came from
that over a period of time
Benefit the patients the
clientele much much more so is
that the intent of this and not
just administrative changes
I've heard about the contract to
Eighties I I think it is
economies of scale as well
What.
Yes that is my question and I
appreciate my colleagues
previous questions because those
were.
So that I can answers to thank
you.
So my question was will this in
the end.
At the how will it benefit
patients and clients.
Chair and
Representative Eli as a
secretary Allen said that's one
of the points of doing that if
you can make Health Care the
system more cohesive for
coordinated and more effective
both administratively is
functioning functionally and
cost wise it will be easier and
better serve
the people of New Mexico.
one of just a little sample
welcome examples
for public employees.
The I. about their insurance
coverage has gone up and up and
up significantly every year so
that many people are dropping
out of that coverage to see it
on their own.
Because they can't afford what
the state or or the public
bodies are offering
and we think we can very much
more in line
it's more affordable and more
effective
Target better outcomes by having
more control another example is
the developmental disabilities
Division exit Department health
has always been out of state
runs the Medicaid waiver for TV
had always been kind of out of
sync with Medicaid funding and
on the rates that are needed and
the outcomes are needed because
one department has the purpose
of the other part Department
page pays for and and it's not
been quite in the state of yes
and so this this.
We've alternately is to get
better service to the.
The people listening co chair
for me one more example of
outcomes from Oregon chair
representative
at UETN are in the sixty percent
of kids are on Medicaid lower
rates in here but a meaningful
number and if you go back a
number of years Senator years
ago according to a terrible job
of screening kids by age two for
developmental delays.
Part of the way the the Medicaid
system that pays for Care is
have a five percent of of that
compensation at risk for quality
this season so one of the
quality measures came screaming
kids by age two and over about
four years that rate went from
about seventeen percent of kids
over eighty percent of kids who
were successfully screen but the
other fifty percent of kids also
benefited because the
practitioner isn't in the in the
exam room paying attention to
the state so they change the
system for all other patients
and so because of that incentive
compensation Medicaid to care
for all kids was approved and if
you think about multiplying that
across the different payers
streams that we would move
together in one place you're
able to take that kind of a
benefit for outcomes for kids
and and expand that across all
of your systems I think I think
it's a good example of the kind
of thing is not necessarily cost
it helps show how things become
better for New Mexico thank you
very much thank you.
Thank you Representative block
thank you madam chair and thank
you Representative how the great
experts we have today like a
room full of efforts so I
appreciate that there so Madam
chair representative I'm just
wondering.
We heard we can leverage better
things like that as the benefit
to changing this and this
agencies name chair Senator I'm
sorry Representative rather.
I'm currently not leveraging.
What we need in this department
to ensure that we can get these
better rates madam chair
representative here
Representative.
there are attempts to do it but
we when you have the email
hundred fifty thousand insured
here two hundred in different
programs to put it all together
I mean there's power in numbers
essentially and so some of that
is happening but we think there
could be more.
Okay thank you madam chair and
thank you Representative.
And then this is given this
builds this given the governor
whoever that person is the
ability to further
reorganization executive order
Madam chair representative.
chair representative the
governor already has a story to
reorganize within the department
Hoyde frosted permanence takes
coming back to the legislature
and so the authority that the
governor would have I in this
bill is to put together the plan
have to come back
to the legislature to finalize
on.
Of all that but this puts a
framework in the intent of our.
Okay thank you madam chair thank
you Representative and former
representative so madam chair.
This would give the governor
more authority not to have to
come back the legislature every
time they want to make changes
through.
From department to department
Madam chair representative it
would just give her the ability
to.
For him where the governor is
the ability to utilize the
executive branch to change the
department.
However statutorily allowed
chair madam chair and
representative some departments
are pretty specific about
certain programs or components
within that department is in
statute.
Others aren't really in statute
and they're just in in in
practice and in the budget goes
and so forth but the governor
already has a story it so long
as there is a statute that
specifies otherwise to organize
with in the department.
most of the programs that we
were with that we would be
moving have statutory authority
of some sort that says what they
are so that'll have to be
changed to the firm where
itself.
Okay thank you madam chair and
the last question so oversight
Weiss Madam chair
representative.
What the legislature still of
the oversight at the already on
this madam chair or would this
be just given to the Department
and there would be oversight
mechanisms created to roll madam
chair.
you madam chair and
representative
of just to make sure I have your
question why oversight of the
process of putting this together
or ultimately of the department
Madam chair representative I
would say both also during the
process of consolidating this
new agency and then the
implementation of the goals that
we've implemented Madam chair
representative former presented
with this be overseen through
the legislature or how we make
sure that the goals are being
established and set manager
madam chair and representative
the government always says I
filled in and statutes and
oversight of these the HSD is
that are tasked the executive
the legislature always have
authority and for creation and
monitoring LFC establish has
there analysts and throughout
the year reporting to on
legislative finance committee in
developing budget proposals and
