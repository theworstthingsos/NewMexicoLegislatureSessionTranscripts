over long periods of time or
conversely.

structures that are not able to
hand handle eight at a fixed
amount of weight over a period
of time.
Madam chair and so.
Madam chair of the committee and
representative will as I
mentioned that these these
oversize overweight loads of
of Bill purposes and they're not
the process of their route plan
that's developed and.
The drivers and the company

Roadway sections however we will
put that and still it out
clearly on.
Our disaster of the corporation

Okay.
Okay I thank you for okay.
Okay.
Good morning parenting thank.
Well as fast.
The.
I'm
sorry go back from House cation
and
Thank you I don't know if.
Madam chair and members of the
committee of and here is that
house bill three.
And I.
Her testimony.
Appropriations acts of war.
There are several committees at
all from that were governmental
committees that stated that
there was a lot of work being
done and.
The time.
The committee that I heard was
roled.
It was stunning to.
Members of the parole for
donating a lot of their personal
time to review parole board
basis.
And sliding up that they were
not getting any kind of
compensation this all donated
time so I suggest that maybe we
should compensate them
for the work that they do I.
It's worth getting worked and
because people do a lot of free
work as you all know just what I
wanted to do was make sure that
this at least through this
particular capacity people who.
Who have the lives of people.
Legislative these.
Given the compensation for doing
their due diligence.
Sure.
The people were reading about
this is about have.
Some patients so that they could
get their work done
in that military branch of of.
First of all.
Six point and then my.
This if you don't mind madam
chair please thank you madam
chair I.
Support this channel because the
parole board deals with the
extremely challenging
circumstances committee really
have quite a lot of time and
energy into making these
decisions
that are that are very difficult
decisions and so the time is
involved and also ensuring that
the commission is always the
board is always able to maintain
a forum and have people present
it really representative cross
section of New Mexico.
for those reasons I think this
bill is.
Thank you thank you madam chair
I'd like to introduce my
Mexico my expert witness is here
to a presenter for.
Madam chair members of the
committee my name is brandy and
I'm going to qualify executive
director and I did get a chance
to present to the house
appropriations and finance
committee on the budget request
along with the executive request
the tax not made it into House
Bill to at this time but it was
original compensation to provide
administrative and pre hearing
compensation to the parole board
members they currently are
compensated as you all are on
and volunteers under deferred
diem and mileage.
And that only applies to the
name here for hearings and when
J. travel so they are not on
page compensated for any
effectively hearing work or
closed hearing worker any
administrative or meetings with
family members are or anything
outside of their normal preset.
that for the need for staff as
well so.
For you all to know there are
about three thousand hearings
that the full four years every
single year under New Mexico
statutes every single family
except for the ones that is
sentenced to life without the
possibility of parole goes
before the full board prior to
the release on the border also
hear sex offender and medication
hearings which are outside of
the normal three release
hearings that they have also
every year they're hearing about
three thousand hearings which I
estimated is about fifty per
working day and three they have
two minutes important for fifty
two the files for each offender
contains criminal social history
educator incarcerated and
includes information about the
victims police report that in
the sentences and so they're
reviewing stacks and stacks of
documents prepared to he's
hearing from and then there is
post work that so as well
We we believe that you know four
work is challenging and that you
know it has the the opportunity
and the special duty to balance
the liberty insurance of
incarcerated or supervised
individuals with public safety
and victims rights and so
they're really doing the work of
a of a three judge panel every
day day in and day out
throughout the year and so we're
asking for them to be
compensated for the actual
service performed by the school
board members we tied this to
the
Current secretary structures.
For the interactive work up to
four hours a day they can of
actual service they can house
forty five dollars and up to
eight hours of the
that ninety nine dollars a day
here asking that the board
recognized the history or that
the number of recognized history
of the federal.
Was enacted in nineteen seventy
five thank you for three full
time staff members in and it
says that they shall devote
their working days to the full
that changed in nineteen ninety
nine when the parole board's
expanded and they made them all
volunteer board and so the
statue has not changed that
requires a program members to do
sufficient educated and have the
training that's appropriate to
hear these these lines but they
do no longer receive that salary
under the state employment
structure so we're just asking
for an additional opportunity
for them to be paid actual
service to change their sexual
offer that and stand for any
question thank you to send this
thank you let's go to the
audience is in support of the
bill featuring your hands.
Those in opposition to the bill.
I see none webcast.
Those in support of the bill.
Three eighty.
An opposition.
Committee members.
Representative little
Representative on the interview
Representative Rehm and then
Representative.
Thank you madam chair thank you
for bringing this forward
I have
the
board member service support for
many for.
And it is really challenging.
I'm sure many of my colleagues
here at service well.
Is a volunteer is very rewarding
we decide who we want to which
organizations to assist and it
is and it can be very rewarding
it can also be really
challenging chairperson of many
volunteer boards I've noticed
this wealth.
That will
board members may want to be
there the present it is
challenging with their rate jobs
and the responsibilities and I
have.
But I can't help but besides
looking at their willingness to
serve it's the respect that I
believe.
We just boards begin to consider
point bringing in volunteers and
recognizing the professionalism
that they bring to the sports.
And so with that
statement I'm wondering I do
support the idea of course I was
actually very surprised to find
that and number of of boards and
commissions were not paid by the
state that are established by
the state I was a bit surprised.
But it's a it wasn't so
surprising to me to find that
there are a number of vacancies
that occur and number of
unfilled positions on boards so
I'm gonna get to a a technical
rather technical question or
process is.
what message would be used to
record time I see there's two
ideas in here either.
By the time if I understood I
read this right it was by the
time by the amount of time that
the actually are working.
on duty toward.
at a I also saw so how would
under the first scenario madam
chair and representative how
hello what process would be in
place to establish a record of
time legislative thank you madam
chair and thank you
Representative little defer to
my experts this as she is the.
Thank you.
Madam chair representative
little there is a process is
basically are ready.
You required for members to sell
out the believe it is the
department of finance authority
and it's the per diem structure
with they have to say which
hearing they just handed or what
their travel was that is
reviewed on three different ways
it is I I finance coordinator is
use I need and if needed as we
reflect the parole board
chairman and so this bill allows
the full board chair to approve
individuals to to be able to to
mark this is actual service
outside of the hearing or
outside well so there is going
to be every our review and we
already have that in place that
the bill references that she
approved by the full board
chair.
And just to follow up question
madam chair so
Representative and speaking
so.
If it were if the.
If this bill passes there would
be another form to complete or
you will it still be pretty
important that will be used to
record.
The
chair of the question I do think
we would have a separate form
projects are with the outside of
that per diem and David yes
extraction okay it'll be very
simple.
Thank you Representative.
Thank you madam chair and
representative so I am curious
about the current compensation
structure for this for what is
in place at present.
We have a very fascinating.
Chart here that we might expect
us for explaining to.
We.
He can give that markets
Mexico is going to be getting
per person annually if we pass
this bill Madam chair of the
board makes.
Madam chair representative law.
Have the number exactly
Representative for member but I
am aware that are executive
request for funds was at one
seventy five thousand to cover
fifteen board members working up
to Max eight hours a day for
each of those hearing that
they're signed to require
members are required to set with
to form for each Cherry.
I think the ones I apologize
it's not extracted the exactly
permanent versus what you're not
that hundreds of the birth of
the stuffed full iterations so
so madam chair and and the
presenters.
To give you an a he was this is
my Madam chair representative so
why this is that chairman and
members I and he told me that
last year is his earnings or his
compensation as a volunteer
number was ten thousand Mr chair
he has one.
And madam chair in the.
And the this Begay was at ten
thousand the per diem money that
we're talking about that's
correct that's all that's left
nine okay okay so the the so so
then if this bill passes.
This particular person would be
getting the ten thousand dollars
per diem per se for playing this
throughout the ten dollars ten
thousand dollars per diem plus
these wages on top right Madam
chair representative more than
not wages they were just or
additional compensation practice
run offering them under state
employment sector fast
and
that would be up to an
additional sixteen thousand a
year per members but I can get
you those numbers and Senator
official madam chair presenter
will keep them from starving to
death and keep
that
thank you thank you for the
thank you madam chair thank yous
have a motion to pass in the
second is there any opposition
distortion.
Finance please show all.

currently many of our records
are actually on either in hard
copy or operations teams so.
These records at this bill will
do is allow for entities like
track records to be an official.
I am and I'm very honored to
have my co sponsor
representative since the radio
with me as well as Chief Justice
of the New Mexico Supreme Court
if.
More not that you've just called
to confirm.
Thank you.
every year every year for
questions.
Thank you good morning.
The audience do we have the
audience who are in support of.
In opposition.
Think of the webcast.
We are hearing house bill one
eighty.
And supported the bill.
Comments in opposition.
I think that committee member
service Representative Zamora
Representative.
Madam chair and presenters.
I'm not an I. T. group by
millions of I was born and
raised on a farm in farming I
worked with him.
But but what happens.
Was cybersecurity.
And then if we lose information
for.
How.
Enlarge image of what you're
gonna tell me is we have systems
of backups.
But I'd like to hear that.
Yes no chair thank you have a
excuse.
From you know of Representative.
Madam chair of
the funding of our of our plans
if it worked in taxation by the
way long time ago and.
Fish and.
Yes he's we did have secure
rooms and I I have to be honest
with you I think that next year
hopefully will be coming back to
you with digital because I I
believe that you know this is a
step in the right direction but
we need to go beyond this at
some point in time.
And madam chair presenters what
about when information is taken
hostage maybe I'm not using the
referred terminology and stuff
but you know I know the City of
Santa Rosa the information got
kidnapped or whatever and and
and then they have to call with
around some and I know there was
a case where I believe the feds.
figured out the ring and in the.
You know that was doing that.
I wish that.
Madam chair representative very
good very good questions
The judiciary certainly is well
suited to protect himself we
currently operate.
A few sentences.
And thank you.
Files up slightly over the
documents.
so there's a number of security
protocols set is required by our
operations as soon I expect this
to.
I'm gonna just to see if she has
to have our our IT department
the judiciary chief she's the
work of the executive she can
perhaps be able to give you just
have to.
Thank you madam chair
representative.
We currently have a problem with
our systems and we work very
hard across the state to protect
the data project access to the
company's as you suggested in
different geographic areas.
Today I would argue that
independent electronic records
actually gives us a great deal
more freedom and ability to
accurately measure to send for
testing meeting records each
topic which would be in one
place and the subject water and
fire another dimension we
actually do have to go back to
of wildfires turtle last summer.
Evacuate Papen interactive
features from out of state a
sister for House which is
actually not all the time
because we're since the store
online in our case management
systems of the state has to act
protector of the.
Thank you thank you for that
madam chair thank you present
thank you Representative little
yes thank you my question
actually follows
Representative Zamora.
I was curious and curious about
how.
what competitions will be made
for this stated to be migrated
as as different the time.
Forms of.
Of records madam chair are
developed
how how will.
We've had you describe
microfiche and now they've been
moved out of whatever is next
how.
Those next stages health will
those be incorporated Madam
chair representative.
Engine divergence in.
Madam chair representative very
good question something we
consider when we set up our.
Let the system which is prove
that their number one we only
talk sure contracts that there
are options.
and that there is in the
contracted protocol for how
those documents can.
Transfers should we and the
relationship with the a lot of
that is sort of the loss of you
have to talk about this
we are very specific in regards
to the way the flowers capped
so that is a file in which
multiple vendors if we were to
transfer from one to the other
one to the other that transfer
could be made so passing the
awesome at thank you madam chair
members of the committee I would
only add that as IT
professionals and and your team
of IT professionals working with
any in C. stores that is our job
to honestly make sure that the
kids reliable safe at extensible
system that will last into the
future of the tape you for we
actions to ensure that that is
true just technology.
Thank you.
Yes
Chasey.
Shares and I think you've
already been to the committee
pardon me so this is your last
committee and I don't know if
you have a copy of the
democratic analysis that
thing that came out for me was.
Thank you have a cell phone food
sitting there with you and that
is trying to make certain that
what ever the storage of these
records make it possible for us
to be non compliant with the New
Mexico will so that.
And so.
For a new.
These kinds of contractually
refurbishments and.
I think probably Representative
right does.
But.
The the under of the whatever
method to the methods that you
use.
Apparently have to provide the
state with the ability to
continue to access to records
and verify their packets and so
I'm just wondering.
If I just told us that the.
Thank you for.
Love that try to questions.
For two reasons one.
Some of my early this is.
Rules of evidence.
Lots of we used to do it right
here we go the state for you
don't have the clerk's office
and verify it.
Hopefully at the time.
We had to leave it there seven.
And you take it back and then it
offers presented so that we go
back to right and then you would
this large volume.
The currently under hopefully
this system the state
electronically would be
electronic from the verified and
through a rule that it's safe to
be considered
as a dedicated for that purpose
in order to be reduced for other
reasons the authenticated this
official record I would.
take save time from work going
to parks office from the paper
being handed back toward and
then when the record electronic
record is actually maybe it's
much more efficient to come up
to the Apollo levels so built in
a lot of efficiencies just part
of the consideration Madam chair
representative.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you Representative.
All.
There.
Thank you I have Representative
green.
Thank you madam chair and
representative have you looked
at the hi are.
Yes I.
Madam chair and Representative.
Judge I'm sure the the contract
of filled the requirements on
the second page I I thank you
for.
The table in
that you meet those standards.
I would just add clarity to it.
Representative Ferrary.
Referred to the requirements
Representative trusted
professionals that is that what
you representative madam chair
representative yes I I think if
you reference one of those
standards or both in our no I
don't know what those standards
are that I think that that would
just help colorful.
For the floor.
Madam.
That would be considered a
friendly amendments.
Definitely.
That seems.
Representative right.
To.
I can do it on the fly.
I think that would be better to
have Legislative Council draft
out and just bring it for the
for.
Madam chair representative.
The work with the judiciary.
That.
You don't see any which we could
insert of turnover that really.
I really think justice from
since going to be the one to see
whether.
Yeah at this point it's
necessary because as I
understand Representative radio
this is going to lead to other
kinds of safeguards that we're
going to need to find
Representative.
Is that right.
Yes so this.
We could further let me step
one.
It is not going to thank you
just more interested in
complying with the rules of
evidence
Representative.
Next year thank you madam chair
representative some reading my
analysis and since it was posted
is that but it was held.
Was a disaster State madam
chair.
I.
Representative pass us packed
six zero.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative so real quick and
some key points questions
Commission public records state
records center and archives well
they need to enact new training
requirements for them to be able
to use these new digital records
madam chair representative.
Chair representative in the HSD
analysis we have from that date
I have stated.
No direct impact on their on
their agency.
And cracks that reduce the.
All the some forms of records
Madam chair representative
that's.
Okay thank you madam chair thank
you representative madam with I
apologize I demoted give their
section so
Will they need
So like I don't I don't know how
you do it now how many records
you you save but do you have
multiple digital records in
different places that you will
save because sometimes the file
can be corrupted for instance
what would you do to deal with
that Madam chair representative
madam chair defer to my experts
just as.
Sure Madam chair representative
very very good question
so currently what we're
encouraging a large bankers box
would go down to our house
and then they would take little
pictures of it and put it on my
page the US each agency for it
has what's called the schedule
for you
so we have a plan in place
Representative readers questions
well we have a plan in place in
which we designate how the
records of Capt how copies of
the records of that and what the
protocols are
with regard to keeping those
records in those are generally
left to the agency in
consultation with our office to
be administrative code I I agree
with Representative that process
should not to.
So it would be similar to
process which stated the little
pictures put on artificially
would just create a protocol for
the electronics.
Okay thank you madam chair thank
you Representative so would that
have multiple copies of that
equivalent of the microfiche or.
It sure is what they would have
I can speak.
I believe that I'm sorry chair
representative.
Yes okay thank you madam chair
thank representative and would
this include cloud based storage
Madam chair representative.
Madam chair representative yes.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative would that be
even the judicial branch because
I know those are very sensitive
records and I don't lord knows
what kinds of cloud based
software there are but I don't
know how you can increase that
property manager Madam chair
representative.
After the.
Madam chair representative yes
the possibilities.
It was going to if they
certainly can be this is your
currently you have raised
concerns.
But refers to the public to have
storage into separate geographic
areas or in this would allow
teachers in the department.
Sufficiently secure losses.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative so my last
question was regarding the fees
to obtain records since the
committee would now be digital
would we be waving a lot of the
fees for printing and certain
things like that Madam chair
representative madam chair and I
need to for ages systems and.
Madam chair representative
very good question we are in the
process of
Search
the limited the question was the
what costs would be for
accessing electronic records and
we collateral you're working for
process continuously make those
records.
Okay thank you madam chair thank
you Representative and regarding
that.
I know I've done it for a
request before that they gave me
like a CD in the mail or flash
drive in the mail or the email
that through a Dropbox link or
something would it be going only
to drop out funds that would be
also including the U. S. B.
tracks and things that would be
additional costs to the
Department Madam chair
representative.
Thank you for.
Here Representative fail fast
like it overseas.
You have the matter.
In which the record is
distributed to personal crossing
record it could be.
Electronically stated the place
and prop ox rafters to secure on
CD or that
Matter which is given to the
person crossing the record would
change.
Thank you for this service Madam
chair representative I concur
with this is something that we
currently Jerry manages our
records electronically this
would allow us to stop
and consider Act Representative
securely stored and managed to.
The record the matter machine
provide them to publicly not
sure okay great thank you madam
chair thank you Representative
and then what and Mr justice
former Judas.
By two.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative thank you for
money to to us is.
I I think my questions more
broad looking at page one line
to the team any public officer
we've been focusing heavily on
this year and our discussion
this morning with this doesn't
apply to other state agencies is
that correct.
Madam chair representative that
is for okay then my question
more broadly for the team to.
Considerations of madam chair
uniformity and integration we've
seen bills we already had
integration and the prophecies
to protect what needs to be
protected part office here what
can be shared for fish and sea
of prostate.
And reduce.
So has there been any discussion
of the house.
That is a nation or uniformity
across state agencies as we move
into the twenty first century.
Madam chair representative I
hope that that conversation will
occur I know that it is
occurring across on state
agencies of this bill is limited
only to the format of the
storage also it is I think that
very first.
Process to to get to that goal
to the organization.
Madam chair representative.
Madam chair and and
Representative is it is that
person necessary step but if
we're all doing it and we're all
doing it differently it's going
to lead to chaos in the address
please but after the four
hundred.
Madam chair the former.
Earlier representative asked me
questions about babies.
And the foreman as technology
changes records need to be
kept and maintained and how the
migrated through various systems
and this this relates
uniformity and migration across
agencies is crucially important
so madam chair and
representative recognized this
bill doesn't deal with it but it
starts down.
So I would like to.
Ask Madam chair representative
please consider that next piece
of legislation you can make it
current if you can so that we
don't feel systems we have.
Methil care.
I just want to give you guys I
used to work in this particular
rel it will say when a long time
ago
in taxation and revenue police
of microfiche the H. P. R. T.
and reset it sure then we would
put into little strips that
would go into a jacket and then
from there they would go into
storage I
I think what this does is it
takes is for the next phase
which is the did digital and
probably some of Bender would
have to come take pictures of
all of that information.
And then eventually hopefully
move into the cloud of the clout
with the secure and there are
vendors that that have that
security that those that would
have to go through an RFP
process
at.
With the state in order to that
that next round.
Still not clear I hope this
you know I think there's a lot
of the now that
are considered secure but.
As we all know that goes into
telecommunication for math which
you know it has to be secured.
So as we move forward and as the
station for it I think it's
really important that especially
when we have.
Records like of our justice
records of those in most every
record nowadays yes please.
So I hope that gives you some
sort of indication where where
this is going
Representative Zamora my
question was answered madam
chair
committee members.
Center do that thank you madam
or you pass and I have the
second do we have any opposition
to the motion.
Show present permanent
Representative you have to pass
thank.
Yes.
You're retired.
The.
All right Representative.
House Bill.
Care workers.
I.
Okay.
We are we do feel we have with
COVID so now here we go.
Thank you madam.
I want to just go ahead.
To go.
Okay the options okay.
So do you want to give us a
review yes I'm here so this is
the provision on I
Nine basically is
the staff with
public that I would like to do
with with raising the tax rate
for my career this is
one of the values that we
brought into this bill we don't
have to continue your visit the
plant count every single time
I want to raise or lower the
plants for the large my program
so rather than place in order
to.
Thousand just early in the bill
do you like to make it relative
to the amount of plants that are
large producers are allowed to
cultivate so this basically
percentage of Santa Fe says
whatever the large producers can
do the legislature's.
So whether that plane County
goes up or down the micro
growers I have that flexibility
to also be able to parity by ten
percent with the with the large
producers that way you don't
have to consistently come back
and say you know reserve lowered
that counts so that's that's
Basically makes it easier for
for our that the care.
Okay.
Representative.
For discussion.
Production motion for adoption
because the already book that
yes.
Previous.
We have a motion to adopt the
amendment.
On second.
The.
To have any opposition to that
motion.
See none.
The amended bill.
Chair and threw it possible.
Yes.
Representative blancs.
You madam chair thank you
Representative.
so.
This changes the number of.
Micro businesses can get what
they need to from the previous
two current Major.
Here Representative law
Currently the.
The services are captive.
And rather than have the orderly
first what we learned in the
past this is.
April twenty twenty two and
recreational recreational
programs why is it two hundred
classes really off economically
challenging for our program in
order for them to flourish
and and be economically viable.
They need to be able to
cultivate more
based on the financial
investment and everything else
that they put into it so we knew
we wanted to come back and
revisit that we were doing that
here in this bill Madam chair
representative by creating an
incentive based on whatever the
large producers can grow thank
you for ten percent of that
right now the large producers
the road forty thousand plants
in which case they would be able
to grow.
and so that makes sense that the
program on the basis of a lot
more
successful.
Alright representative on and
this is the fact that we got
from the industry in.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative so you know for
the bill I don't know which page
it says pip but can you tell me
what the difference between like
a plant is verses like the
budget on the plant does it
change anything regarding how
much you can grow.
plant like would you cut up all
but it's it's still planned
that's pretty much what I'm
trying to pass Madam chair
representative for.
Right.
Representative walked so we have
different plans essentially two
stages to ensure and mature
cannabis plants when we begin to
flower as shurikens and that's
when it counts towards the plant
County once in the interface we
know that students can die so we
don't count that towards the old
I.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative seven this would
be than that.
mature plant would have to be a
thousand now that's the calf ten
percent would be two thousand
two thousand okay thank you
madam chair thank you
Representative concluded a
little for me I appreciate that
and so then going on to my
analysis here.
Yes Representative is in within
the cannabis control is our
opening can you give me a little
some.
We would be doing.
You madam chair representative
so again for the value of what
we come out of the commission on
Saturday
who have who is the chair of
that commission to answer
questions if he's online if
there is any clarity provide on
if necessary actually what this
looks that we look at the
overall at the counter program
this equity position look at how
in which we can create the
flexibility within the industry
and with the department to
invite and industry that looks
and is basically New Mexico be
able to have the equity is about
nontraditional businesses that
would be able to answer.
This is one of the things that
are in this sector off on that
hi Laurie how to be able to meet
the mechanisms to create equity
within the overall industry and
they have sophistication
themselves have basically come
up with that plan and Services
office position would be within
our of these that are within the
Canseco divisions Fund eight
that action on.
Of the.
Madam chair representative of
social equity was one of the
hallmarks of the regional campus
the legislation and it's not
just the.
As a representative responsible
state it's this is broader than
a lot of that a lot of people
that would want to use to rural
people to rural economic
development we have a tremendous
response from people who know
how to grow things especially in
southern New Mexico central New
Mexico is so we're just trying
to look at and the vote the
sources and to provide holding
you know sort of and economic
opportunities for everybody in
New Mexico so that position
really focus in on Lori barriers
to entry you have to make sure
to get the regulations as rights
don't over regulate for under
regulation we're not
disenfranchise anybody from
future.
Thank you madam chair I just
wanted to say that I read a
great story about your County we
come the napa valley now this
and if you're on the map.
I again that type of business.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative I would be
totally open in the napa valley
from.
Madam chair and that so okay so
we're talking about rural folks
how can we be specifically
helping them with economic
development regarding this
equity council with the
marketing the some kind of other
facilitated force that we put
forward would be.
Madam chair representative
exactly one of the things that
we realized it through this
process that a lot of these.
Or really.
Recent economic development
support as a result of
being able to connect them to
the tools and resources that are
C. economic development
provides as well as perhaps
local economic development
opportunities and just creating
that those creating that network
opportunity is really this is
looking at and the.
Madam chair representative knows
this that it one of the the
feedbacks after delimitation was
the the our licensees wanted
more education on how to run the
cannabis Business the tax
implications about cannabis
which are very complex of
financial tools having to do
with and think of what comes
into this is he still has not
been and there's a bill stalled
in Congress right now to try to
clean up some things up for
right now the the small of your
in flight out of my know how to
grow things very well is having
to navigate the maze of
bureaucratic and financial
barriers and so one of the ideas
about this is devoting some
resources to helping people stay
afloat and have this model and
working with economic
development in the program okay
thank you madam chair thank you
Representative and I think
that's super important for any
business I know are all the city
commission meetings back home
and there's always someone that
wants the building resumes for
cannabis stop or something like
that so I certainly think that
it's important be more business
friendly for sure so Madam chair
representative I know that can
assist a lot of water.
And so how would we be helping
these rural businesses and
managing how much water they
have to get and I know I I have
no idea how much one plant takes
but I certainly would want that
also to be included is that also
included in this plan madam
chair representative so we don't
have an this bill at all of the
original bill and the standard
right now is that of those who
are seeking a license have to
show all right
as far as you know another
potential opportunity acting on
equity program and some of the
business building is being able
to share that to show
conservation plan already how to
do that successfully I think
would be a great asset for this
program to have thank you for
bringing that but it's not the
substance of of water does not
fix.
Okay thank you madam chair
representative so I appreciate
that and certainly going back to
the bill you strutting your
amendment with nursery.
Page four.
Is there any difference between
that and micro businesses thirty
in the statute madam chair Madam
chair representative I think you
were here on Saturday when we
heard the bill that we need it
right at the back from the
members of the audience on the
confusion that this provision
because in which case district
and for precisely through
clarity and the fact that we can
actually already do this and be
able to
create a mechanism for this
through without complicated
confusing that thank you to the
folks on the.
For providing a.
Okay thank you madam chair thank
you Representative so that I'm
seeing in the FIR it says a this
immense the cooperative
association act to allow
nonprofits organize for medical
cannabis licensure under the
Lynn and Erin compassionate use
act to resolve and incorporate
as a for profit corporation
sufficient provisions of the
statute Madam chair
representative with this changed
a lot for these nonprofits would
give them options that would
force them to be.
Cooperated if they do you have
that kind of business manager
okay I had level and I'll.
but madam chair representative
so currently the legacy
producers are providers of
cannabis are still under the the
phone number of the department
of health so there is an office
in the basically haven't been
able to move out of that creases
kind of gray area only for the
canisters full revisions the
overseas that recreational
Senator.
Verifies with that role is for
Candace control and insurers
referred by canal the under the
guise of.
That's my high level.
Representative in and I think
just to clarify under the old
medical program you have to be a
nonprofit the license and so now
we move to of both adult use and
medical and we have the those
legacy providers want the option
to go to a for profit models yes
that there's some of the most a
nonprofit this is a mechanism
of.
To
convert to a for profit staff
okay thank you madam chair thank
you Representative and so how
would that affect businesses
such as I have friends that the
cannabis businesses but they're
not selling cannabis so they're
just selling like drugs
regarding.
The medicinal qualities with
this affect those businesses
Madam chair for that one at all.
The.
Representative.
I think you guys answered my
questions that I might have one
that's stragglers so I might
come back thank you madam chair
representative Representative
Rehm thank you madam chair and
representative of you know I
remember when we were yes I with
the bill was presented on the
floor and richly past one of the
things that was discussed was
the the each marijuana plant
will be no mature ones use I
guess.
so I think that's a huge
consideration racing this crop
but madam chair and
representative do you have
anything that you're
contemplating is this
legislation to address the
driving I know in my district
the first day that recreational
marijuana was legalized we have
the fatal traffic crash of from
the.
Drug impaired marijuana drug
impaired driver.
Madam chair representative I
think it would be a great the
session for the next bill with
just three fifteen were sitting
at funds for specific to
substance abuse and prevention
So this bill.
Madam chair representative I am
gone through this bill
originally just I think I sort
of the another amendment.
Is that amendment also around
here for is to been what's that
not submitted or what.
Madam chair representative which
weapons.
And the analysis it has some
different language on the
amendment is our and I see this
one is a point.
Was there a point one that was
offered and if so where is it
and then through the point one
version only have a ten percent
increase the point to version
where I the portion of the
nonprofit law Representative
Lara yes this is about the
nursery license that we
completely removed
from the bill sieve so that is
basically it was just in
addition to the point one
version.
and madam chair in
Representative so now we no
longer.
Have a cannabis nursery or can
they be.
Under the producer they can be
able to serve what it is
what we have thought we needed
to fire I was the ability to
sell plants on in like a nursery
like setting
Madam chair representative what
we heard from feedback on
Saturday during public comment
today which we are even if the
bill is to basically stop the
confusion on whether or not
these plants would be how they
would be regulated sectors so
we're we're not even touching on
the nursery license whatsoever
he removed that provision
currently if you sell seeds or
plants themselves you can
actually do that with in a
licensed facility already in
which case we don't take we
don't change that.
Madam chair representative on
page five on the.
One twenty four you change the
one thousand to one to.
Of the total what what does that
actually work out today Madam
chair representative is two
thousand.
Madam chair representative can
you describe what the real
problem is why we have the if
you will double.
yes Madam chair representative
so are we when we went program
that is being as of April of
last year we we get
understanding that the economics
of only allowing for that many
plans for my business then.
so going back to the small
business support everything else
that we've been discussing and
the need to help these be
successful that limitation on at
that low level essentially you
could put them out of business
would because it's just too well
an offer for them to be
acknowledged revivals so what
we've done and that is basically
make sure that if we raise the
plan cap or lower the plants
count for the large businesses
that they would be able to grow
more for the relatively lax to
the large producers here.
madam chair and
Representative does this now
apply this same applied to the
medical marijuana growers.
Madam chair representative this
is only the micro businesses off
under the the
Just control division the for
the for profit services.
Full of Madam chair
representative a marker
producers and grow for medical
patients or use kind of up to
them to decide what that
percentage is it
Though if they do to be exposed
decided these medical we do have
their licensure discount but as
of now most of our major
producers of medical and adult
use products.
Madam chair and Representative
what I heard a lot of.
Negative comment was from the
medical marijuana producers not
being able to grow enough so I'm
I guess my question is more how
this is legislation to address
that problem.
Madam chair representative we
see again of those but
that most of the medical
providers that we're license and
the only are some of the biggest
providers you know in the state
and so they went in so the if
they go to a for profit more.
They are but that was one of our
concerns as well we usually want
to have enough production so
that it didn't affect the
medical market and I think the
legislature did a pretty good
job of scoping out.
Since April first we have not
seen of the of
of of supply and demand for the
vet and so we're not seeing
shortages on the medical side so
where we have it's sort of a
benchmark we did basically plant
came out too sure that the
medical side of the state and we
still see a very vibrant medical
of the provision of other states
sometimes you see.
We have medical uses though he's
you sometimes see
you then we'll go down but I
think there's certain of
modifications and and structural
things that have for you the the
medical.
Market we haven't seen the in
the real date of supply problems
with the medical market.
And madam chair for
representative.
Do you see this well let me ask
it this way how much does I
don't know one gram marijuana
cost current lease.
Well it's very and so we're
we're going to sorry sure.
Okay Representative
in Santa and we're that the
division we we do a lot of
background we use our C.
additional system to try to
track certain thing but we're
also going to do the surveys of
the licensees I can see just
generally that the poll the
retail price her grant is about
eleven dollars program and and
the wholesale price that
sometimes of the cultivators
will sell to retailers these
maybe for five dollars on the
wholesale market but again we'll
try to get you better numbers
once we do the the survey of
licenses.
And madam chair and of
are all the you see this S.
warring that price what I'm
hearing from a lot of people is
it so expensive.
Madam chair I think what we're
seeing of these the statement is
to create a more equitable of
market across the board I think
you'll start seeing the in
supply and demand if we.
Please the the the price per
gram passed on down the
surrounding states of Colorado
used to be eleven dollars ram is
probably closer to eight dollars
a gram retail senior staff
California Morgan they've all
seen the prices come down of on
that and that's very important
because it needs to I know
something that you're very aware
of is of we want to be the
illicit market right so this is
Margie can undercut the
legitimate market on pricing but
it's also dangerous right this
is not yes it is not it's it's
this was a project so has the
price comes down you see that
that's a very good tool to sort
of the first the regulated
market and undercut Phillis
itself.
You expected to start coming
down gradually over the next few
years.
Madam chair and representative
we go to page nine and we go to
our.
For the immature cannabis plants
so we're gonna leave the
definition of all on
although we got rid of the
nursery correct correct.
And madam chair and.
Top.
Representative I soon the.
That they are selling immature
plants to private individuals is
that occurring for or is it a
sale between distributors.
Madam chair of.
Madam chair representative so we
do see so that certain people if
it's an immature plants they can
sell it to somebody else you can
still see that that are
considered mature plants you do
keep track of when we do
require staking the the
cultivator put that into the sea
the sale system you know so we
can track your friends so we
have account.
And but it's also.
It's the way to put it is
cultivators will we'll
typically this is how how they
do they have of the home other
plants and so the the mother
plants are sort of space of the
different strains that they will
sell and our call today and then
the go and clones of the plan to
instead of putting seeds in the
clone the plant by few of Cody
and then that will be immature
plants as it starts to grow and
then ultimately once it starts
flowering and count that as a
mature plant in so it's a
Senator of it's the best farming
way of sort of keeping your here
your.
The process.
Madam chair and Representative I
I assume that that really cuts
down on the growth time.
is.
Okay.
Chair of.
Representative.
So if we wanted a mature plant.
How on.
How long does it grow to the
point right before it has
flowers Services bugs and then
how many well all I ask is that
going.
Chair representative thank you
eight it kind of depends on the
the setting whether it's an
indoor grower and outdoor growth
of plants officers responsive to
light so essentially an indoor
grows you can trick the plants
into thinking that it's spring
or summer so depending on the
facility that hang on the size
of space of research may have
they may within a year have
anywhere from three to five
cycles of of harvests.
Trying to write some of the
staff just later and the
outdoor.
What do you think on that Madam
chair representative the outdoor
cycle what do you think you
receive their.
Madam chair representative
anywhere from one to two
typically want to book.
Sure those also this is current
law so.
I don't know read this we're
happy to talk about the industry
and health plans work that's
we're not changing anything
okay.
And madam chair Representative
there's no plant limit on image
for.
Madam chair representative now.
C..
And so that's the real
leverages have is because of.
If if if you're gonna hold our
license I think the common lines
very quickly but madam chair and
in our own
fact if I remember correctly on
the liquor it's up to ten
thousand dollars Representative
madam chair representative that
is correct ten thousand of this
is just a subsection for making
materials material false
The ignition or a search on your
application and so that was
subject to a thousand dollar
fine or that your license your
application will not be known as
well.
Madam chair and of
Representative if each twenty
five lines one through five
we're talking about here the
closer to the three hundred feet
from the school well.
We at St Paul better course need
marijuana schedule but
we have a state law that mirrors
federal law and you probably
ought to look at the federal law
because federal laws of thousand
feet.
Representative we're not
changing current law in this for
that that will Madam chair
representative the feds can come
in and take that business.
Because it violates federal law.
So you may want to consider
that.
Madam chair of.
Representative this go to page
thirty.
And what we were looking at
lines one and two.
Hi to enforce the provisions of
the canons of regulation Act the
division is authorized to
examine.
And what I think we need to add
their.
It is something like at any time
during normal business hours.
So it's very clear that you can
go into a business north during
normal business hours and look
at records inspect the location.
Please provide future feeding
from we I'm sorry page thirty
lines
three and four to enforce the
provisions and I think you need
to put in there at any time
during normal business hours.
Madam chair representative of
again I think the global
practice in using the liquor
control act as a as an example
are for the past since you know
since prohibition ended
they have the ability to go in
and check records in and in
depth on this is really
important piece of trying to
curtail the illicit market we've
had have reports of license
people that have a license from
us the accusation of the
allegation is there sort of.
Participate in illicit market
Candace and so we want to be
able to go in there check
records to source the financial
to see where they got these
friends how their process these
plants in just sort of have a
trail of evidence to go back in
there so we would never ask the
the tire time I've been around
lately control act we never and
you Psy.D whatever forms in as
always on the during business
hours because that's what you
want to get the documents is he
going after hours.
They would be open so.
Madam chairman of oral the are
you I agree with exactly what
you're talking about I mean
I see down here that we're gonna
talk about subpoenas and I think
when you hear the other section
of what I think you need to do
thank you we'll see how the tied
together you know clearly you
could get a search warrant based
on probable cause the subpoenas
the easy route give some time to
go ahead and do that but when we
go down to line seven and eight
sort person to testify under
oath concerning concerning the
subject matter of the Enquirer
talked about a subpoena.
to make hi a permanent record.
And.
C..
and then
permanent record of the
proceedings and then I think you
need a new B..
If we refuse to inspect during
the normal business hours of
license shall be suspended and
this is subpoenas Shelby saw.
Madam chair representative goes
down to the I think that fair I
just
requesting a subpoena for
and getting their act for on the
importance of the subpoena so
Madam chair representative I
think that if this is again
here's current alcohol law is
and how we best to gate so.
Madam chair representative I
don't think I think just that
I'm understanding provides the
where with all to to do what
you're saying I think we need to
do.
Madam chair and R. L. the so
what is the normal time to
respond how many days to respond
to the subpoena.
Well Madam chair representative
yes the way we do about policies
that a lot of times it's this
power is is vested with the
division of turn and so the
attorney will just I you will
call in to our attorney and say
I need to pay no for Jack's
lounge.
I want to the the security
camera footage and in and the
receipts for example right to
make sure that they're doing in
the station we can turn around
that subpoena typically day I
signed off on as division
director and we get back into
the hands of law enforcement and
they serve the subpoena
typically
I think it's I.
Chairman exactly I think we do
have on like three days to
respond to the subpoena I
believe but don't quote me on
that chair representative so on
pages Pueblo no more than five
days so within that time frame.
This is what we do the system is
up that point is that they
refuse to you know get paid at
the District Court judge of two
eighty in the speech so the
District Court.
Madam chair representative
that's why I think you need that
language up there that when we
came in we said we're here we
want this and they say no that
their licenses suspended and
that you're going to get a
subpoena because if you but I
did have of liquidation of
Business.
Madam chair representative if
there's another provision in
here which were after requesting
of the legislature to ensure
that we can.
That suspension mechanism in
this thirty seven section
fourteen so
if we are lucky for you to do
that what you're saying in that
case that languages further
along but it's precisely along
the lines of what you're saying
okay.
I'll have to read that section
the euro is and see if that
takes requiring concern.
Here Representative this is
going on in the future that's
and so any suggestions will take
a hard look at that time the
forgets the officers of the we
can address some of
state that's the that's the
mutual intent here is to create
the.
S. economy but we also active
forces.
The issue It for powers to
enforce that.
And madam chair and are of the
and you know I've got no problem
copy this page showing you my
notes or or whatever but I think
you could type in that section
of will the
you know if I I agree exactly
what you're trying to do and
with that that's all my
questions for me no.
That was featured said recent.
Thank you Representative Senator
thank you for that meant by
chair.
So I appreciate them
Representative and witnesses
that
Representative rams question was
respond to that regarding.
Regarding what happens
the state I question I
understand.
Of what could happen what you're
trying to avoid by in these
micro growers with these Michael
Kors.
what and correct me if I'm wrong
what happens if it's not in fact
I heard that it will help in
addition to the economic
Considerations
to the growers it will it did I
understand correctly that it
there's also an opportunity to
under illicit sale.
Absolutely Madam chair
representative more regulated
cannabis we have on the market
the more under costs not only
sales that lowers the price
because of the house of
Why so that's what we hope to
see this more than anything is
better response from my
programmers already that are
struggling city that the
economic demands of being able
to grow sufficient amount to
stay in business in which case
this really helps
Have that sounds sort of bottom
line interest thank you
appreciate Representative Ms
questions earlier all my other
question for risk.
Thank you thank you
representative Representative
Chasey thank you madam chair
just just one quick comment.
Is that our you're not putting a
hard and fast number in statute
I'm always trying to suggest
that we have some way of
indexing building so that.
We have to come back and change
the statute either annually or
or every five years or ten years
thank you.
Thank you representative
Representative love.
madam chair can I have him go
first because the is next
question.
You may see here Terry present.
You thank you madam chair and
the presenters bringing this
bill forward.
So so we're.
We are changing.
On the regulation part of we're
taking out let's see which.
We're removing the cannabis
control division of regular of
ours RLD.
From the provision and they
creating another.
Office right.
Thank you.
Well.
From the title.
So so just go back to the title
here in front of your bill.
Relating created a cannabis
nursery license changing the
plan County
log read an online fourteen
removing cannabis control
division.
Program
the uniforms you madam chair
Madam chair representative so so
regionally the campus bill was
had course every administrative
regulation has sent the process
for licensing right so the
uniform licensing act was used
as.
For this reason but looking back
the in form was enacted really
for those kind of professional
boards that are at for the
commissions that are of the
farmers doctors osteopaths
things like that identically
because they are virgins boards
in so we don't have a canvas for
for example they will vote on on
administrative by the nursing
board of pharmacy board is that
these if we suited for those
professional teachers so what
we're trying to do correct in
this ammendment and this program
is to make it more of the
overuse regulatory market which
is more of a citation model so
that when we do inspections the
something wrong site you and
that is the process comes right
and then appealed to this court
so it's just replacing one due
process with one that's better
suited for and all.
Thank you thank you for that
answer madam chair and and the
presenters
And then we're deleting the
application and renewal fees for
vertically integrated cannabis
establishments you kind of go
into that for me and.
Sure so so
So the way we.
Last year was set up was that we
the legislature created a lot of
different types of licenses to
allow different people to get
into different segments of the
cannabis con there are some
states that taken the hive here
there's some states that limited
to just thirty providers and
they do all the retail growing
and it's a monopoly right this
is the opposite of that this is
sort of a pop open opportunity
the state.
But one of the things that we
have the regional fill with if
you got enough thank you so did
you have a renewal fee for your
license and then if you're being
told you have to have planned
for the five dollars per mature
plants and then you also have to
pay for premise so if you have
multiple problems and so most
people as they go along a all
those fees but it gets cap if
you get beaten up at a hundred
twenty five thousand dollars and
so we just thought that the
affair often virus and not to
create any anti trust issues we
wanted to remove the cap so that
people can grow bigger but they
just have to pay for their
plants and their premises fees
as they get.
So madam chair and.
Give me your name I.
And
So Andrew.
At.
At a hundred twenty five
thousand dollars.
Recapping the fees so it's seven
hundred twenty five thousand you
can go any amount of plans.
And and so as much cannabis is
the one.
Representative that's the case
that's what we're trying to
revise.
Basically every provider track
is there more shares no cap.
So so what we're doing here is
eliminating the can.
So so now the state will well
the.
Representative mostly make more
money.
From from the we have center
Representative.
More so their share provision.
Shares of this has been talked.
So so on page fourteen.
line eight use the it reads the
division chill.
Filiation license to cannabis
retailer applicant at a discount
if the applicant provides
documentation agreement to
accept cannabis products on
consignment from cannabis
producer Michael business and
integrated cannabis micro
business license percent yes so
so.
What what is this in here what
where else can they go to get
their cannabis to so.
Representative that's current
law so we're not changing at
all.
So they have to buy from
licensed producers right.
Everyone in the state if you
have an access to the seats just
summon as.
And then and then we go to page
fifteen.
lines twenty three twenty five.
So are there premises that have
more than one license and by
will.
Madam chair representative what
that we're trying to do with
that so the only area where
we're actually making machines
is to basically clarify that for
those who currently possess
state of.
Whole aces and account of his
license and they happen to be
the same person on process you
know I I have I got a call from
the chief procurement well this
down okay.
This own the whole building
just like a strip mall down
there right so this is a message
that that if you happen to own
multiple businesses nearby other
long as you're following the
zoning regulation Act you can
still possessed to licenses so
long as there's a there's no
properly so this just clarifies
that what we did for performance
prohibit that from happening it
was a very our church Division
didn't know that we were seeing
this conflict in in reality so
this just means that those who
occupy those those areas are co
locating they can still be
licensed Senator okay so they're
not running to Madam chair
representative they're not run
into cannabis businesses.
Two different points more so we
didn't want alcohol being
sold in the countesses.
Patient.
That was originally which we
needed to clarify that you could
still be licensed in two
separate locations.
Okay and then we go to page
sixteen.
On the line ten.
It says a.
Designated smoking areas in
order.
Area or in a standalone building
from which smoke does not
infiltrate other indoor
workplaces or other the indoor
public places.
Where where smoking is otherwise
prohibited so I know we had a
situation in fort Sumner.
We had a growth we have a grower
over there and.
Madam chair representative and.
They were in a standalone
building.
But yet.
Their exhaust was getting into
the other buildings and causing
people to have headaches and
this and that the other.
Does this is this gonna fix that
problem or is it we still stand
alone buildings and once the the
small goes out of their you have
to deal with
the current law states that if
you are reading of your
violation so in fact that for
situation and you brought up
that should not be happening on
in which case we can you know
the remedy that based on current
law which that would be a
violation of the jobs and
or act and madam chair
representative so I didn't go in
that building that it wasn't.
There have been in it only tend
to go into it that much smoke
inhalation from that.
What are they doing in these
buildings that would cause that
much.
Exhaust of of smoke.
That I don't believe they were
smoking it I believe they were
doing something else chemically
or something in.
All.
Madam chair representative so
the the line that you pointed
out a specific to cannabis
consumption area because there
is a risk that they would be
smoking at work right the next
for producers retailers that
standalone building requirement
is in place but just what we
heard from industry is that
there are filters that you can
buy there was a kind of mitigate
that that smell
But they should if they're just
producing nation the.
Consuming and in nineteen.
And madam chair and
representative one up.
I'm trying to remember what I
heard from one of the locals
that they thought that they
were.
Infusing something into the dry
plants or something in
National so so there's nothing.
mentored Representative is there
anything that they do with these
with the the cannabis that could
cause something like this Madam
chair representative without
specific you know understanding
of what was going on there it's
really hard for us to sort of
wrap our hands around but we do
recommend as with any of the
acts that is currently in force
and and we recommend folks
reporting these types of
incidents so that we can
investigate and perhaps we're
ready any of those situations
that might the meeting adverse
into situations and and madam
chair and representative maybe
under can enter this on this
what what your response times
something like that.
Madam chair representative of we
have a pool we're trying very
active with the complaints to
try to follow up on complaints
because we don't want to get
state right so we have we will
hear something that happened we
try to go with with the spas.
Hi evidence or someone that now
most of what you you're done up
at the Johnson clean indoor air
act is mostly regulated by the
local municipality is so they're
very very quick.
To go mitigate any nuisance and
so and they're very responsive
as well the to the neighbors
because again you know Candice's
the rules provide both with
starts interfering with other
people's businesses or something
like that that's a concern of
all stocks.
And madam chair and
representative.
And what we are trying to
protect the the medical cannabis
industry on this bill as far
shortages and and how we deal
with the chair.
And madam chair representative
how to how to customers.
to the customers to going to
cannabis shop and and there
wasn't any medical cannabis
important.
Is there any notifications of
that building or anything that
or they're telling them where
to.
Place a complainer for FY.
Madam chair representative we
haven't had to encounter that at
this point to set any food
industry interest so you know we
would be a little regulator
over.
Producing any sort of worried
that you know we the industry as
well as the SEC has done an
immense amount of jobs it
response to questions they have
a very robust website
to be able to look at any
complaints any concerns anything
very industry and public facing
but they can basically address
right away they have that so
they believe they have had to.
Contemplate that issue but
You know there there is very
very clear about responding to
the needs of the public and the
food industry and and madam
chair and representative it if
that's the case while on the
page eighteen the it's just a.
We start off on line six is as
required license a licensee who
are licensed to produce cannabis
to produce a specific quote a
mature cannabis plants to be
designated for medical cannabis
so then it goes to the the on
the four of section eight.
The division may require a
license to devote no more than
twenty five percent why is that
not a show.
Madam chair representative
that's current law again
refusing apple so.
madam chairman and
Representative all rephrase my
question is if we're going to
support the medical cannabis in
green and and put some.
Guidelines by it I mean this
isn't really doing anything
important am I correct madam
chair and representative Madam
chair representative that
provision is precisely and there
in order to if there was a
shortage that the CCTV creating
commented forced a mechanism to
make sure that we Metcalfe the
medical cannabis around again
for not changing at all current
law.
Hey madam chairman and
Representative an online
fourteen there's also a million
in the division may require
specific training tracking of
cannabis plants but then there's
really no enforcement there.
If it's not a show.
The more you get current law we
don't we we unless you're
shortage situations provides the
opportunity that we don't want
to do that without.
And madam chair and
representative on page nineteen.
Okay line seven it's a person
who is a member of the New
Mexico senator New Mexico house
of representatives on the
effective date of.
Shall not apply.
Or be granted a license to
engage in commercial cannabis
why is that.
Madam chair representative
wanted to billions of together
cross sorry
Representative Friday from the
work that they being done by
this body to reject insure that
this is completely objective
from any of our insurance
interests provided
representatives we have a roll
call will be excused for a
little while but just wanted to.
Given that notice.
Madam chair would you wish to
overhaul the bill is.
Now we can.
Finishes started the federal we
don't have a quorum so we're
continuing thank you thank you
madam chair just just thought
I'd ask.
Madam chair you threw me off.
Thank.
So madam chair and
Representative there's.
There's legislators and all
kinds of businesses that we
legislate on.
I'm surprised that that there's
restrictions on that just a
quick comment and Madam chair
representative
On the next page on page twenty
line fifteen.
It says that the on behalf of
the state
shall be remitted to the state
treasurer for deposit and
current school funds.
Do you have any idea how much
more.
Cannabis money is going to
current school funds now Madam
chair representative this is
current law it's not cheating
just.
Okay and so madam chair
representative so we don't have
any idea how much money
I just thought you might have
that information so they can
help us legislate on this on
this
Help us on this legislation
that's okay
I think some of these have been
answered already.
Okay madam chair and
representative on page twenty
three on on C. Nibert.
It says a license may may
increase the number of mature
plants licensed at the time of
renewal.
And one other time per year in
increments of five hundred
plants
fees maybe for pro rated for the
remainder of the license so
madam chair and and
Maybe this is a question for and
Representative is.
How is it structured so that so
the.
Growers don't just get out of
compliance and then you're
looking you go back and say well
this is okay you're gonna be
allowed to increase anyone.
How is this one point at.
Does this play out what one does
this if this guy this is grower.
Is not.
Following the rules and and then
you go over there and inspect of
a find that the as more plans
and that are you just going to
give them.
The permit to to increases
houses for Madam chair
representative we're not
changing any of this current
law.
madam and representative maybe
Andrew can go into that it's a
so we can kind of feel
comfortable about how this is
playing them Madam chair
representative we went through
this in the interim relief and
we're not possibly changing that
will Madam chair representative
We're here to debate these bills
madam chair and and.
We're not getting an answer on
that I'd like to build.
How section C..
Is it plays out.
In the actual world for these
rules have to be followed
I understand I just wanted but
we also have to focus on current
bill that is being sent.
And we're asking questions about
what is already in okay.
Representative Madam chair point
of order
unfortunately whenever you open
up a bill you can change in the
wind bill so.
we get to debate the whole
saying certain if we wanted to
strike you to make a motion to
strike section see some
Representative Madam chair
representative but the reality
is that you're asking questions
about current law that doesn't
change the substance of what's
happening in which case we were
not prepared to responsive
numerous questions of what we're
not changing or changing in this
section on chair representative
is about making sure we don't
have a cap on regulating our our
large producers so that's what
we're we're changing this
version of law chair
representative the information
that you're requesting is
superfluous to taxes.
This.
Representative.
Top of the list Madam chair of
of trying to go over that and
and try to rephrase my question.
Madam chair I'll try one more
time to refer a lot of
questions.
Madam chair and representative
at what point.
Can a person apply for that
increase.
Madam chair representative when
any person comes to the front of
the cannabis industry they must
apply for I have they must go
through the application process
with the and this vision what

the chair representative why
this right.
Madam chair representative that
was languages put any regional
cost confusion to the licensee
because we have a legal
interpretation that said that
you have to get a manufacturer's
license package so we're taking
that out of manufacturing so
that so that if you are.

package it comes inception or
your cultivation.
Okay thank you madam chair thank
you Representative and then the
page twenty three.

cannabis.
Establishments.
Why Madam chair representative
as we discuss with
Representative Zamora others
this is basically ensuring that
those who were not having to do
more than a hundred twenty five
thousand dollars worth of
license licensing.
The other plants address that
basically we have more plants
that costs more than a hundred
twenty five thousand dollars and
you pay those fees to the state
there's no incentive program
there's no longer cap.
Okay thank you madam chair thank
representatives of them
regarding the enforcement but if
you accidentally have an extra
plants maybe maybe your cap is
three thousand plants you three
thousand one plants.
what you would pay for that
additional funds chair
representative madam okay.

Madam chair representative very
briefly this is the
a is the size of cannabinoid

complex and uses a lot of
aerosoles and lots of of
alcohols it's a very volatile
