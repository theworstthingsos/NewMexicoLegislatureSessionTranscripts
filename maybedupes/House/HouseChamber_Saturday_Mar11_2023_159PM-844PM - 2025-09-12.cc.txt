We have a problem in New Mexico.

We cause that problem.
And.
The issue is not going to go
away.
Asking them to pay even more
personal income tax than ever
before.
Mr speaker.
but I I sincerely believe that
it's an issue that will cause us
to be back here if we don't fix
it.
The people in New Mexico think
we're paying playing provided
leave quite frankly we should.
Not expect them to do anything
different than the leave and go
to where they can find a better
living with better working

been a couple of bills of that

issues going on in my own County
San Juan County we have an
outpatient facility that does
great work its own sixty percent
by private docks forty percent
written that that facility is
going to have to close because
it's eventually going to be
kicked out of the PCF.
And so what happens whenever we
have these outpatient facilities
sold to large corporations.
Which are these huge medical
conglomerates which I submit is
not good for patients and New
Mexicans in the long run.
would really or just to re look
at how we're defining those
outpatient care facilities I
think that's extremely important
it's important my community it
is going to have a real
half an hour from where I live
so our docks can go up there and
practice all they want and it's
New Mexicans who end up
suffering so I just encourage

and it is a bandaid it it all it
does is say that
that is that lawyers cannot
venue shop when it comes to
county where the claim has been
filed Mr speaker once again it's
it's a bandaid this is nowhere
near what we need to do and like
what it is it's we raise the
rates on.
We raise the amount that doctors
can be sued and then instead of
making it reasonable for these
going to do that and I think
what we need to do is just lower
the medical malpractice
insurance rates back down to
where they were and let's just
put a fund together to pay the
trial lawyers directly Mr
people need their doctors.

unable to take this seriously

a three hour debate and then get

that we do in our committee
process that I think we can all
agree has yielded some strong
results and is put us on a solid

public US capitalism school.

throughout the the stated for
your ties them there's a list

There are some kind of out.
Some of this goes to water

Of some of it goes to hello this

goes to the governor and to the
legislature for capital outlay
What is a little bit different
about this process this year is
we are not bonding again service
tax dollars we are using general
fund money.
this year.
And I'm sure many of you were
asked when you came before you
come up here what to sink
question spend that money on.
Many of us said we should be
spending is on one time.
what's going on right now this
this bill is about while who
roughly one point one billion
dollars and it is our structure
And then the other thing that
that does is it allows those
severance tax dollars instead of
bonding against them they can
flow directly into the severance

dollar and fusion the tourism
huge help to that funded alive
so continues to contribute to
our general fund every year so
Okay so that's that's how it
works that's how to to pass the
time is a little bit different
this time.
Now I want to talk a little bit
about the process this year.
so.
together and negotiate when a I
had the privilege of being the
chair of the tax committee you
know it was a the the gentleman
from Santa Fe Representative
Trujillo who is the ranking
hazard for the Senator for the
house.
We'll go back in time and look
at how it's actually been split
up.
That really really happens that
way when I was the chair we did
but it's been done many times is
that has split half of it goes
to just statewide projects.
you know government buildings
Martinez how was under governor
Richardson so that's kind of
what we really traditionally
seen.
and so.
it's and what the governor had
asked for was.
We need bigger it was like
seventy percent for.
Yes it was really high.
And of course being the fiscal
conservative I would like to
assure the pie size down so that
all fit together but that's not
what happened and we have you
know in the the fiscal situation
all match properly and so when
we first started Mr speaker and
gentleman it was going to be
roughly one point seven million
dollars per member that we're
expecting to get towards the end
for that that change we are
spending a little bit more than
I would have liked but that's
still part of compromise and how
this works.
Hundred and fifty million
dollars and that includes ten
million dollars for
for tribal projects.
In the other side of that pie is
Worked out.
there was one other very
interesting thing that I just
want to mention that I think is
a great development.
And that is for the first time.
When I was in a five million
dollar share.
And that has never happened in
the past I've I've been aware
of.
You know worked so well I don't
let's partner together to do
some big things ensuring that
was before the bill was paid
that is huge so I will give
kudos to the governor and other
Okay so I I want to.
Thanks for the people and and
and ensure part in order
so first off of this bill really
has a dozen or two dozen
projects in there it is a real
challenge to put this together I
don't think many of us really
understand how hard it is to put
together so I really want to
thank.
help us but the work all through
the year they don't deserve all
of the different state
facilities throughout the year
and the help rank and
prioritize.
them when I was chair of got my
eyes opened and it really is a
big deal for small asset I
resent this just incredible that
In in this bill and it's similar
to the governor's portion which
I appreciate those great the
time she put in her portion
threatens ten million dollars
just for that that one reason
and I just want to make sure
everyone hear understood that
that was why everything else was
in the process is amazing
just take where capital outlay.
Laughter this is a great joke I
I hope that's not the case here
not required to involved ranking
member but you all did.
And

as it was when
We were looking at school
districts not too long ago and
and I don't remember anybody
jumping up and down and and
making comments about that but I
do need to say Mr speaker from
my my point of view that had
formula together and was
completely
Unfair for the school districts
that I represent so one of I
want to point that out so it is
not only when it comes to
know how many and at what
amount do we have an outstanding
capital outlay projects at this
time.
currently we have an outstanding
balance of over three billion
dollars so my my question is is
what's the re authorization
timeline for these projects in
this bill.
Okay so Mister chairman
gentlemen it would be the same
structures we do was severance
tax bonds.
Mr speaker and gentle lady yes
ma'am.
to once this bill is signed into

gentleman to those run through
ninety five million did run
through that process and about
fifty million did not to the
local and the the fifty million
with the local share.
Okay so Mister speaker of
Mr speaker gentleman do you know
what portion of the governor's
tribal funds went to McKinley
County.
minute to look at their info I
think that's important Mr
speaker gentleman
The governor's always had a
portion of the capital outlay of
funding.
curious then they're looking for
it now.
How much of that actually of the
governor's tribal money went
into McKinley County because as
I've looked at these projects a
desperately need to get capital
outlay into the hospital Mr
speaker gentleman I've also seen
that
Put money into things like the
domestic violence shelter and
Mr speaker and gentle lady that
wanted yes ma'am.
So Mister speaker of the members
these projects have gone through
money actually went into tribal
projects in McKinley county.
Mr speaker and gentle lady there
working on that right now and
we.

to put the members at ease then
if we could subtract that twenty

I think is it is a better

I don't believe.
That one governor one party.

equity acequia statewide so then
I really got to look in Mr

And
Over here under the Interstate

it was kinda startling to me
because under the office of the
state into new year's budget or
nine section ten thirty million
dollars to acquire land.
And water rights to plan design
construct and equip
have concern about that but then
I also turned over here to where
the Interstate Stream Commission
is Mr chairman and gentleman and
that all starts on let me see if
there is to funding mechanisms
for sake is on page one thirty
three there's eight of them
eight projects on page one
thirty four there's a projects
seven eight more projects page
one thirty eight seven more
projects and this does include

It's also including the five

Mr chairman I mean Mr speaker

that shows up in here I want to
know why Mr speaker.
Mr speaker and gently those are
great questions and all the
identified are exclusively

that list.
Mr speaker that's one heck of a
lot of money this gonna be spent
in there and yes I do get it but

there's a big discrepancy in
what is being described in this
And then the flooding that came
after that it literally washed
out one huge section road up
there and the amount of damage
that it did downstream was
but I saw first hand the damage
that was done there is there's
no relief in this bill for this
for the town of rid of so or the
special appropriations related
to those areas affected by the
fires throughout the state of
New Mexico and then
so hopefully that that helps Mr

No.

Mr speaker Representative that's
correct.
Mr speaker I really yield to the

sorry that I think I must have
missed heard the the last
if you force the employee to
read it.
Mr speaker joy from Bernalillo.
Can I look into can appointed

Mr speaker Representative
sentiment email does not violate
Bernalillo so I'm just free to
send an email.
Communicate all the political
speech.

Bernalillo so okay maybe can you
help me to understand what
what's the purpose of this bill
because I'm frankly I'm a little
confused right now.

Mr speaker Representative I
would think so.
But yet somehow it's okay if I
don't.
Feel compelled to open the
email.
does make a lot of sense to me
noticed that there's some things
that are left out for example
you don't you don't include a
limited liability company so it
seems like if I own an LLC that
incorrect that would be
considered a corporation LLC is
considered a corporation Mr
speaker generated from earlier
years aware there's a separate
set of statutes that give
authority for Lynn like kids
LLC is the same as a
corporation.
Mr speaker Representative the
word cope Corporation
If this state had not passed
those statutes to authorize the
formation of a limited liability
company then businesses could
not organize as an LLC they are
Mr speaker generated from
Bernalillo of so.
Can you explain to me how a
corporation in the polls and is
Mr speaker gentle and from
Bernalillo I would encourage you
to actually look at the statute
to limited liability company.
Mr speaker Representative our
position is that it's the same
thing.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo and.
So I I'm concerned about frankly
my ability to run a campaign if
this bill goes through and I
think every member of this body
should pay attention to this
point.
meeting where I'm gonna explain
to them.
in my view on politics.
Mr speaker Representative we did
terms of being part of a
political campaign so this would
not apply to them Mr speaker
gentle lady from Bernalillo so
let's let's use the same example
so I hired twenty door knockers.
issue comes up this is exactly
how you want to respond to that
line of questioning Mr speaker
gentle lady from Bernalillo is
that am I allowed to force those
employees to attend that
meeting.
go to page three section do.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo and and what within
section do.
is necessary for such employees
to perform.
Their job duties so Mister
speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo so this I think is
for example how to operate a
particular door knocking app.
It would be this is what you
need to be dressed this is how
employees is this is what you
shall say.
In response to questions I'm now
directing what your speeches I'm
not talking about the necessary
Mr speaker Representative is
that it doesn't affect of the
situation that you're talking
about.
Mr speaker generated from
Bernalillo so I again I look at
Representative can you could
repeat the question Mr speaker
gentle lady from Bernalillo does
this apply to the employees
speech.
to does it does it affect the
employee's ability to engage in
speech.
tell me what what is the.
What is the short title of this
bill.
Employed Mr speaker
Representative employee free
The employee free speech act but
it doesn't affect the employee's
speech is that what you're
saying.
this piece of legislation
protects employees from speech
that they do not want to hear.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
I do not believe that a court is
going to look at this language
and say it does not apply to
to attend a meeting.
But I'm not prohibited from
regulating their speech and I
find that very hard to believe
in light of the fact that the
business.
Except for maybe all season and
we should all formal cease but
what this bill is going to do to
business.
And each of our own campaign
representative Nibert.
Thank you Mr speaker will gentle
lady from Bernalillo county
yield Mister speaker I will be
able to the representative.
correctly is not to deal with
the issue of what if the
employee's job description is to
If the employee.
Can decide not to.
Perform that task.
Can not decide that.
Mister speaker July Mr Mr
speaker Representative I wasn't
on I'm sorry let me let me just
consult with my expert witness
again.
Mr speaker gentle lady could you
point me to the page and maybe
lines that provide for that
exception.
Mr speaker Representative it's
the same expert the exception
from communicating to its
employees any information that
is necessary for such employee
to perform their job duties.
So Mister speaker and gentle
That the employer could could
require that employee.
To attend the meetings and to
communicate those political of
Mr speaker and gentle lady I'm
not sure I read paragraphs do as
as providing that to come for
maybe as broadly as you I'm
by having in their employee
employees or a team of employees
who are supposed to advance
Most employers and thank the
gentleman from San Juan pointed
out there are some exceptions
but the many employers from
answers but I cannot support
your legislation thanks for the
debate the gentleman from
Bernalillo Representative Rehm.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentle lady from Bernalillo
then I want to give you a
scenario and I think you'll
understand of money
means matters relating to and
we're on page two of long for.
So those relate to rule or
regulation change proposals.
communicate the employers up you
concerning political matters.
And Mister speaker.
Gentlelady from Bernalillo I
And the employer said if we if
house bill whatever passes I am
Mr speaker Representative it
would only be a retaliatory
action if someone refused to go
to the meeting.
If they Mr speaker
Representative if they.
Okay Mr speaker and gentle lady
I take you up to
Wanted page two one and
Fourteen.
Mr speaker gentle lady I think
that is clear when I read this
the political matters means
matters relating to a rule or
opinion concerning a political
matter and he says if this
legislation passes I'm gonna
have to cut everyone's our hours
supported in in the committee
you agreed with me but I guess
that is change thank you madam
speaker R. Mr speaker gentle
lady as for the debate over from
I'm just giving him a couple
minutes to walk in the room.
Welcome representative Duncan.
email from my you stored.
Talking about political things.
Mr speaker Representative it
doesn't apply.
Okay.
You take a one step further than
let's say I own ABC company and
we are you shop and I send out
Mr speaker Representative it
would apply he forced the
employees to read that email if
you made it mandatory.
Mr speaker Representative I
don't understand the question Mr
speaker
Mr speaker Representative that's
the function of their
employment.
So the bottom of Mr speaker the
bottom of that email I state
what I'm stating politically.
force the employees read the
bottom of the email you
discipline them for not reading
the bottom of the email that
applies.
Mr speaker Representative only
if you discipline them for
refusing to read the bottom part
of that email.
We support a candidate that the
union support.
Mr speaker Representative you
can't force them to do them.
Ms Mr speaker Representative
it's hard to answer your
question because it's difficult
to know exactly what you're
talking about.
forget that we're going to meet
at X. the officer we're going to
visit with Canada someone so
he's running for office.
Mr speaker delay but this is not
about going to meetings this is
about opening an email.
cannot force an employee to go
to a mandatory meeting that is
political or ideological in
nature.
Thank you Mr speaker then so I'm
not in trouble for the email.
Mr speaker gentle lady I'm I'm a
little confused on.
How do I how do we tell them not
Mr speaker delayed it I have an
amendment but I don't think I'm
going to.
Representative because I don't
think this bill is I think this
We will probably be the third
challenge thank you Mr speaker
thank you gentlemen there is a
request to remove our coats
gentle lady from Bernalillo
county please yield.
I will yield to the
representative actually read
that all the way across it was
And let's say it was for staff
and legislators and they felt
that microaggression was
political.
Can the staff for the
legislative skip the meeting
Okay that leads me to the
question was going to ask at the
very end how do we define
political matters because it
falls under so many some
are defined in on page two
section see political matters.
Okay Mister speaker gentle lady
so it I guess that then that
But matter we could skip that is
that correct Mr speaker dealing.
No Mr speaker Representative
only that meets the definition
of political matters.
Mr speaker Representative what I
read that section.
Section see on page two starting
with line for political matters
the decision to join or support
a political party or political
organizations civic organization
committee organization fraternal
organization or club
organization.
training to influence.
Then it becomes a political
matter is that correct Mr
speaker delayed.
Mr speaker Representative can
Okay so let's say for example Mr
speaker gentle lady I am told I
Definition of their party and
uses it to influences that mean
if I don't have that same belief
system because of my political
beliefs that it becomes a
political matter and I would not
delay as my belief system my
core belief system or what I
feel is political and what is
not Mr speaker Representative
the law does not apply to
with the staff of the staff
members here and they believe
that certain training and their
to them as a political matter
because it's one party uses that
as political leverage or
Speaker Representative it
doesn't relate to political
party.
Mr speaker gentle lady can you
read the definition of
influence legislation rule or
regulation change proposals and
the decision to join or support
a political party or a political
ask you a hypothetical question
sorry.
What a for a somehow let's say
we just passed a bill in this
house that every staff member
beliefs on that Mr speaker and
gentle lady.
Mr speaker Representative I just
want to get some clarification
so your question is if this if
With the with the B. if they did
not attend what I'm trying to
get a Mr speaker gentle lady if
somebody feels that something is
own political believes can they
decline and not have any
retaliation Mr speaker dealing.
trying to the to say is it comes
down to view point right if if
we were subject to go to
something that is politicized on
one party or the other it
their view is it's political and
it became a political matter and
now they're being forced to
attend a something with
retaliation so Mister speaker
purely political.
And let's say they had to go to
a training to teach them you
must wear a mask because X. Y.
and Z. and they're saying no I
political matter Mr speaker
gentle lady Mr speaker
Representative wearing a mask
was probably
Necessary for their job.
mass I didn't really wear a mask
and wear mask it till they see
my face right through it because
to me it's politicized so are
you saying then if I was a staff
member and I did that I didn't
not relative to this language
here.
This law I'm sorry right and Mr
speaker gentle lady here lies
the problem.
we're learning a lot about the
mask mandates which doesn't
work.
And I feel it's political that I
feel I have the right to not
attend a training as a
no this is a political economic.
It also goes a vaccinations goes
to everything else so my problem
is it's your perspective in your
point of view if you happen to
because it's your view versus my
view and that's where it lays
into being completely unfair and
unconstitutional so for those
reasons I cannot support this
bill thank you Mr speaker
Mr speaker the gentle lady
please yield.
Mr speaker I will yield to the
representative.
Mr speaker gentle lady who got
Generally the
I think the problem with the
bill.
It is an actual before start the

Mr speaker Representative labor

gentle lady and so to me this is
who wrote this bill but if data

Mr speaker gentle lady what

speaker Representative H. B. two
forty five provides employees
the option of opting out of

political or ideological in

You know how many things Mr
speaker gentle lady.
Are seen as political matters in

And so we just actually Mr
speaker gentle lady we just saw
something that for some of us
earlier.
the last couple years Madam

have we have people that come

speaker gentle lady.
meeting I need to explain to you
whether it's a hospital whether
it's the money that I work near
whether it's even at the funeral
home Mr speaker gentle lady
care what which one what sector
you're in.
Mr speaker gentle lady
What I'm trying to say is.
Mr speaker gentle lady did you
no idea about the thank you Mr
speaker gentle lady and there
was some stuff in there and I'm
not trying to change the this is
just this is to a point speaker
gentle lady some of the
legislation that came out was
called a mandatory meeting so
they can understand this some of
those people Mr speaker gentle
lady could see that maybe they
agreed with the legislation is
which was not in burial but
leaving them to go to decompose
it's called composting body
composting Mr speaker gentle
lady what I'm trying to say is
impossible for any of us to be
able to keep from this violation
so Mister speaker the only
connects plan to me.
what would the consequences be
for that business by requiring a
simple meeting to express maybe
legislation that is going to
giving examples of what could be
seen as political I'll just go
ahead and throw the mask in
their will through the shots in
there and I can keep going on
all night but I don't want to do
about what we just did what
would the consequences to that
business be.
Mr speaker Representative you
gave the example of having a
meeting with the with employees
attempting to influence the
legislation.
Mr speaker gentle lady I may
have to because it may destroy
my business Mr speaker gentle
lady.
attending your meeting were you
are attempting to influence
legislation so Mister speaker
gentle lady.
I don't know many people and
businesses here in our army
business whether you're the
owner or an employee everyone is
generally supposed to profit and
leave that business and it's by
working together Mr speaker
to be profitable.
So that we an effective
efficient and respectful to
other to other employees and so
and they find that that's a
politically charged issue.
And I say well if you don't show
up this is this work this
pertains this could almost be
for someone to to protect my
employees.
And it can be just as simple as
a mask that is absolutely not
rules to protect yourself in the
health of your of the rest of

a political way that their
again the question is are you
attempting to influence
legislation could we would miss
this I'm gonna give you the same
Mr speaker gentle lady alleges
same vague answers yes ma'am it
writing them up and giving them
a warning that this is important
for them to stay healthy in our
business and it was but the
order is political and now I'm
liability you from getting hurt
and get your thing eat the
sentence so we can get uses it
so vague that particular person
have to show up to these
meetings.
Mr.
Thank I don't mean to cut you
off Mr speaker Representative.
Mr speaker Representative so we
Mr speaker also the written
warning that you describe Mr
speaker Representative the
written warning would not be
employees not showing up to the
meeting Mr speaker gentle lady
now.
Of all my employees are single
building show up Mr speaker
need to look at the language in
section C. at the definition of
political matters at the meeting
that you're forcing your
employees to go to this under
that definition then yes it
all of us to come together and
and.
And and.
Protect their interests as much
as the company's because if
there are I can think of that
the I was thinking about this Mr
speaker gently so a person comes
into my it to my office and
with something political on and
they don't like it and they
don't meet the dress code the
speakers only and I have to
reprimand that that particular
here but.
I think.
I can see how this would
adversely affect
the money.
function that's is them
they have meetings that I think.
that they need to to explain to
meeting and I'm telling him how
to vote or how to this or that
but giving them the issues.
I could see this as a violation
here that we can we can go back
me what would the consequences
to business that to.
That violated this what what
those consequences be.
violation of this then they can
read be returned back to work.
Mr speaker gentle lady so if I
hire someone.

that the Senate has passed a
Senate Judiciary Committee
substitute for Senate bill

Senate bill one twenty four as
be entered gentlelady from
Bernalillo Representative
Chasey.
Mr speaker I move the go to that
order this is third reading of
legislation no objection it is
consent of the house of the
rules be suspended and the
record show that all action
necessary for placing House
Judiciary Committee substitute
house bill three one seven on
but it's much simpler than it
looks this bill essentially does
three things on the first part
it harmonizes New Mexico's
treatment of medical subrogation
that all service providers be
treated the same way that we
treat hospitals and doctors it
provides them the right to file
a lien against the plaintiffs
award of damages and makes them
equally subject to the common
motorist insurance and it also
protects people who follow the
law from financial ruin and
under insured subrogation suit
this bill requires that
insurance companies to prove
punished for not having enough
insurance if the damages of an
accident exceed your coverage
ultimately this bill will
gentleman from Chavis
representative Nibert to.
Thank you Mr speaker does the
gentle lady from Bernalillo
county yield.
Mr speaker I yield to the
minority whip from Travis
to to the real chase if.
A person has the minimal amount
Insurance companies.
That are involved they can go
against that person's insurance
company and collect those
though they're insured would
have sustained injuries over and
above the amount of insurance if
I understand the bill correctly
is that correct.
Insured has.
Mr speaker and gentle lady the
only person that could seek
recovery of those additional
Mr speaker and gentleman yes the
injured party could then file
suit against.
The port fees are in that
that would allow them to step in
that.
Injured party shoes is that
correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
damages over and above the
insurance women's.
This would prevent them from
having a contractual
relationship with their
amount of damages over and above
the amounts of the insurance of
the tort freezer.
Mr speaker gentleman the
Whatever.
For your delay I think they to
raise our rates for premiums
person who was at fault for
those injuries.
Yes Mr speaker and gentleman
they would be able to do that
little different than maybe
maybe I didn't ask the question
quite clearly in in Committee
but but so there's nothing in
damage party to pursue damages
over and above that.
Mr speaker and gentleman I'm
understanding your question
correctly the answer is yes they
can elects to reject the
Mr speaker generally that they
would have to reject the the
insurance claim money's so what
what I heard you say.
Mr speaker there's further
debate the gentleman from
catching granted in the local
representative that us us.
Mr speaker gentle lady
please sealed.
Mr speaker I yield to the
gentleman from the
aforementioned counties thank
you Mr speaker gently yes the
ominous alone the house lost my
place sorry.
more so
I had we had like four accidents
been unable more fault so I
would like to see how this would
witnesses David ring is a trial
attorney practices in
Albuquerque.
And to answer your question Mr
speaker Representative.
This bill will help expedite the
reduce by the proportional
amount that a lawyer reduces by.
And like the same way we treat
doctors hospitals and insurance
go to court to record damages
for your car accident your
lawyer will charge you usually
to traditionally it's about a
third.
Bill expands the definition of
third of service providers treat
them all the same and says that
all service providers who
provided you with service after
your if your lawyer reduces
charges one fourth Sen here
service providers would reduce
their coverage our side would
Speaker gentle lady how I'm
sorry I got distracted the
speaker gentle lady so how does
the injured person benefit from
this.
Mr speaker and gentleman the
result some service providers
not all most service providers
are very good about
About following the common funds
but this just puts it in writing
treat you all the same you all
must reduce and so it just it
expedites the case really
canisters dollars in real quick.
Can you just defined service
providers to make sure I'm on
twenty five service providers
are twenty one to twenty five
the service provider means a
natural person corporation
company trust partnership
incorporated or unincorporated
and so the definition of service
Frederick does go on to say that
the service provider.
Shall be licensed to provide
that care when a license is
you get in an accident to go out
and end up going to the hospital
and I had that happen in my one
of my kids with speaker gentle
lady where you know you get
you've got I mean I don't know
what it and I.
To memorize your your definition
of service provider but we'll
see the wrecking company will
party who provides you with
services of our day that sees me
as a direct result of the
accident Mr speaker
Representative so Mister speaker
gentle lady that means even the
sorry and says Care in the bill.
So.
Provides care to that patient so
I Mr speaker Representative I
don't I actually don't think
for not keeping up with the bill
and and so you're saying all
medical providers and so they
would automatically Mr speaker
gentle lady twenty six settle
the bill the if if.
Representative yes Mr speaker
gentle lady there are sometimes
and I want to understand this
because sometimes when you go to
the doctor
pay that's a different amount
how does this level the playing
field and which level is it on
when you say because it's not
really written here is what you
say so what level are we at
proportional so if that doesn't
really mean that the Medicare
package doesn't really mean play
into this at all it's just when
that all serve medical will not
medical all service providers
must also follow the common fund
drive to reduce by the same
ratio that your lawyer reduce
Court to that generally tends to
be no more than twenty five
percent as us on reasonable Mr
speaker gentle lady Mr speaker
Representative insurance
companies already do this.
already reduce and so we're just
leveling the playing field for
all other service care providers
so it doesn't really play into
what level of coverage you have
cause medical insurance
I was saying that our percentage
so Mister speaker generally
somebody's gonna obviously be
low on well because you're
averaging you put on the same
playing field so what I mean by
not be charging as much or or
settling for less others are so
stark want to settle for more
can you give me a couple
examples of that when you say
level in somebody's gonna have
to go down a little bit somebody
amounts at all that will not be
changed by this bill at all the
amount for which a case is
settled what we're talking about
is that the amount by which
attorney most attorneys charge
about a third thirty three in
the third some charges lowest
twenty five percent some charges
much as forty percent this
Representative so Mister speaker
gentle lady and my understanding
is is by reading as a discount
real quick is that
working how does this affect
Thank you Mr speaker gently I
think there's a lot of for real
reason I'm I'm kind of asking
should somebody questions Mister
speaker gentle lady you're a
good person but.
When you see all these doctors
over here that the you know and
to me I'll be honest with you
that of the attorneys would then
dictate what another party would
have to settle for it's it's a
visitation with that and so I'll
try to if there's any other
debate that I couldn't study a
little more hi I would do that
unless you can explain to me a
little bit better make me
understand a little bit more to
that point because this bill
actually treats doctors more
fairly already in statute
doctors insurance companies and
hospitals are required to reduce
so I believe that this
legislation level the playing
field for our doctors because
doctors insurance insurance
companies and hospitals are
to add just for some clarity
because I know this like I said
at the beginning this bill is
really dense we are just talking
about damages awarded when a
lawyer must be brought in to
your smile Mr speaker but as
well as well and have a good day
Mr speaker this are a limit on
all.
Federal funding which is ****
mess is committed billion
credential with us as Mr speaker
Joe and then I'm just going to
go into that in the you know the
Mr speaker gentle lady so the
way it works currently no one is
a hundred percent or rarely a
hundred percent at fault move
traffic collision so there is a
the attorney negotiates with the
of the insurance company they
come to a settlement amount
whatever that amount is and then
Mr speaker Representative I
believe so but if we're talking
about an accident where both
insurance companies have come to
an agreement there would be no
about is where you're gonna have
a subrogation and so Mr speaker
and gentle lady so now what
you're proposing is who is going
have an in a collision between
two insured parties and both
insurance parties agree and find
a settlement then there is no
and I got in a car accident if
you were injured in that
accident and my insurance
company says no we're not paying
you and you have to go to court
to collect damages then we would
be talking about the possibility
settlement there is no
subrogation in that in those
instances Mr speaker
Representative.
is true but just for the medical
subrogation.
The web I laid out would be true
for medical subrogation
instances Mr speaker
Representative and Mr speaker
work with if you will an
adversary to try to go ahead and
get
system works I'm also worried
that the checks would now come
out in multiple names or maybe
they're divided up if everybody
about you're describing existing
law and this would not change
that the insurance company would
still cut a check to the
attorney who then please who
then pays out to their client
the client pays out to the
Mr speaker gentle lady I think
that's all the but I it's it's
changing the playing field and
transferring more of it over to
client and can have a more
honest conversation with them
that the insurance companies
would be negotiating with the
service providers today.
That I understand that correctly
what you just said.
Mr speaker and gentle lady so
releases are given to the
attorney representing the
individual correct correct and
Mr speaker Representative and
this bill would will not change
that.
to do it says you've got to cut
years by a quarter because I cut
money by a quarter is doing that
ago should issue Mr speaker
Representative that will be done
Mr speaker gentle lady thank
you.
There's a gentleman from
Bernalillo in Torrance
Representative Lord.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
Thank you I shouldn't say from
everyone.
Torrent from Bernalillo thank
you Mr speaker delay so I've
done a lot of billing in my
lifetime so normally what
lot of times people will get a
lean and they will go with an
attorney because the attorney
can handle all that so that way
they don't have to pay the
doctor they don't have to pay
the physical therapist they
on this bill normally what
happens and when I've done all
my billing the attorney gets
that lean to make sure that
everybody gets paid they have
the you know the car parked
doctors also okay
the total bills came to thirty
thou but if we don't cut the
costs this person's not going to
correctly is now that they want
those said doctors to pay.
The attorney fee as well is that
correct Mr speaker delayed not
the current practice that they
would file a letter protection
to make sure they get paid so
what this bill does is it allows
service providers the expanded
definition of service providers
are awarded in court those
damage the settlement awarded
goes the Attorney.
The tourney who has those leans
and pays out the insurance
company doctors hospitals
service providers etcetera.
Mr speaker gentle lady under the
common funds like I said before
doctors hospitals and insurance
companies are already paying
that reduction this is just
clarified that they should
because in most instances right
now Mr speaker gentle lady.
Most service providers are
already doing that it's just the
cases where some service
amount that require already for
doctors hospitals and insurance
companies Mr speaker
Representative okay Mister
speaker gentle lady because I'm
looking at the summary that I
questions about.
They're saying that in this bill
there's nothing in here Mister
speaker gentle lady that a
chiropractor that is doing care
yes they should negotiate
attorneys fees at all is that
correct Mr speaker Delaney Mr
speaker Representative it says
that they reduce by the same
amount that we require doctors
hospitals and insurance
worse before it's kind of more
of honor system another
something the English line all
that other stuff but every
doctor work for who wanted to
have a good working relationship
that went like this if you're
want to.
The service the client to make
them upset and you don't want to
make the New Mexico the attorney
upset because not gonna work
with the attorneys this is how
it works.
So they're already doing that on
does not reduce their feet
because that's the tourney's
fee.
For practicing the case for
recovering any damages that
might be more inclined to
support this if they were saying
okay all you guys in the piece
of the pie you're all going to
cut your fee were mandating you
have to cut this B. by ten
forced to make the cuts the
funded stand this Mr speaker
gentle lady unless you can show
me in here where the attorney is
also being mandated to cut their
nothing and the damages would
not be awarded without that
attorney the attorney is
fighting in court for those
damages for both their clients
and the service providers so
we're just asking the service
most of the time the attorneys
do collect most of time they
don't go to court most of time
they settle outside of court
I've been doing this for a very
very very long time so what I'm
Mr speaker gentle lady we
doctors already or produce this
puts nothing new on doctors this
just levels the playing field
for those doctors by asking
other service providers to
relationship with an attorney if
they're going to cut their fees
they all know the game they'll
understand how this works but it
So the gentleman from leaders of
the group.
Thank you Mr speaker does the
gentle lady from Bernalillo you.
Mr speaker I yield.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I
think I heard.
For a provider to reduce their
fees.
So that.
The injured can receive a
I don't know if I totally got
every part of your question they
don't reduce for the purpose of
paying the injured party.
and gentle lady why would they
reduce Garcia.
This rate with that reduction Mr
speaker the gentleman who is
they in that instance please
whoever gets the money from the
additional damages to an
attorney at all what this bill
insurances that more money in
the settlement cases stays with
attorney this negotiating this
to reduce their fees they both
provide a professional service
doctrine no damages would be
awarded its art that having
doctors hospitals and insurance
companies reduce is already in
statute.
Mr speaker and gentle lady so
what you're suggesting is I can
get in an accident I could
negotiate this on my own I would
have to hire a trial attorney.
Still confused about this I'm
sure there's.
A piece of this that makes
sense.
I I
emphasis was behind you care
carrying this bill Mr speaker
Representative I absolutely can
the.
The root of this bill is
actually pretty personal to me I
had a.
uninsured she was an uninsured
motorist at the time of the
accident
if I can tell you the story I'll
try to be as brief as possible
she was driving down the road
and then at the light where they
stopped at the red light the
motorcyclist pulled up next to
her on the passenger side of her
van and started punching her
fifteen year old son through the
hit him repeatedly in the rest
with the ranch damaging his
wrists but he but she was able
to get him off of her son and
they sped away.
She was then sued by his
insurance company for his
damages even though that
Any penalties that she faces a
result of that and Sharon's are
one hundred percent her own but
I did not think it was remotely
fair that she should be sued for
bill but there are other issues
with medical subrogation that
needed to be modified and
addressed and I think this bill
does that Mr speaker
Representative.
motorcyclist was the one that
was guilty of of creating that
issue.
For Mr speaker and gentle lady
is that just one side of the
story.
The lady I was just curious I
appreciate the story I'm just
curious to the jury decide the
outcome of that and that that
court.
That they did not have to prove
that the accident occurred the
way their clients said.
They said the insurance company
went to court and said we do not
Really burned me up as one might
imagine and that is why there is
a section in this bill that says
that the insurance company when
they see someone in court for
subrogation is required to bring
sue somebody in court for
subrogation because it does
happen to some degree as I've
seen.
This requires that they prove
their case Mr speaker
Mr speaker I now move the house

highlight that one of the
reasons that New Mexico tech is
a
Good fit for this project is
because they've done similar
they're not either legislative
judicial or executive thank you.
As for the debate the gentleman
from Otero Representative block.
Thank you Mr speaker with the
gentle lady so you know I
thought I find your bill really
interesting and I I find it kind
of complex and I would just love
to unpack it Mr speaker gentle
lady so I'm on the original bill
Mister speaker gentle lady data
structure I just want to make
crystal clear that is not the
data itself but whatever's
managing containing X. cetera is
gentle lady and I like all the
cool words were used and now
very interesting so Mister
speaker gentle lady this this
infrastructure are we trying to
do to.
advisory some kind of advisory
entity to be able to normalized
throughout the state of New
Mexico what we're doing Mr
speaker generally.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
Okay thank you Mr speaker and
gentle lady so then with this
bill.
What.
I'm guessing I'm just trying to
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you gentlemen so there are three
things easily that I can mention
so number one Mr speaker done
number three Mr speaker and
gentleman the data structure.
Okay thank you Mr speaker and
gentle lady.
So the data dictionary is that
just trying to.
everyone's on the same page Mr
speaker gentle lady.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman I'm a data dictionary
witness to the body so Mister
speaker and gentleman and body I
have with me Carlos Romero who
is the associate vice president
for research at New Mexico tech.
they play a role in this new
data driven entity were putting
forward Mr speaker thank you Mr
speaker gentleman they would
certainly be part of their.
different boards and things that
they're having to oversee Mr
speaker gentle lady.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you gentlemen guests there in
gentle lady so then do we know
if we're if this is been
successful in any other places
like states or entities Mr
speaker gentle lady.
promote better data sharing
practices thank you Mr speaker
great thank you Mr speaker
gentle lady seven regarding data
sharing now how would we go
or could they just directly go
from department to department
would there need to be any kind
of advisory role when they are
doing large data spreadsheets
for instance Mr speaker gentle
as a reminder no data is flowing
between anyone at this point in
time this is simply to catalogue
and understand what we have and
We are in the twenty first
century after all Mr speaker
gentle lady so with this include
analog type things that we're
trying to digitize to get into
Thank you Mr speaker gentle lady
and I I guess we probably
haven't by the amount of paper
that we use that our legislature
at eight ministers speaker
gentle lady but I I think that
Data rich with schools so PED
data I know it's a very a lot of
sensitive data there as well as
CYFD places like that Mr speaker
gentle lady how would we have
gentlemen that's exactly what
we're going to study.
Cool thank you Mr speaker gentle
lady well you know every every
answer I'm getting it sounds
like I'm liking this bill a
It's expensive Mr speaker gentle
lady the initially what are the
costs going to be and then what
do you project future costs
maybe Mr speaker thank you Mr
speaker and thank you gentlemen
budget for this the study is
we're expecting one million
dollars to New Mexico tech and
then part of this study will be
border Commission Mr speaker.
Mr speaker and gentleman I don't
know off the top of my head of
You know the COVID within that
Funding.
Okay thank you Mr speaker gentle
lady and so then the makeup of
the board for the commission
could could you please tell me
committee I do I think I use
those the words interchangeably
but for the data advisory
committee.
Mr speaker and gentleman the
secretary of the department of
information technology so do it
one Senate member or designate
with expertise in the
application of technological
technological solutions to
public sector data appointed by
the speaker of the house
Then it if you'll recall in our
general's office we said that it
was the committee member would
be appointed by the New Mexico
sentencing commission.
another member with expertise in
health and public health care
and public health
one representing state courts
solutions to public sector data.
Great thank you Mr speaker and
gentle lady and seems like
there'll be a quite diverse
board which is very good to get
You know I I don't know what
these words mean technically Mr
speaker with technological
solutions to public sector data
Mr speaker gentle lady to they
need some kind of a degree or
some kind of certification or
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentlemen so that would be a
subject matter expert as
bill is so there's subject to
the open meetings act and then
Mr speaker gentle lady I believe
we said they're not is that what
was amended out Mr speaker.
meetings act is this a I just
wanna make sure were.
Being in line with other boards
and commissions and I believe
this is a committee Mr speaker
generally.
Okay thank you Mr speaker gentle
lady and then so is this subject
to any IT pros are would be
extremely redacted like some
papers I have gotten back in the
past that are just like black on
time on that by just saying that
the documents are not subject to
express except for the summer in
the reports.
Okay thank you Mr speaker gentle
structures and then is there any
kind of oversight of this
committee other than just the
members that compose it Mr
speaker gentle lady.
information that's discussed in
the data that is happening or
data structures that are
happening.
At these meetings Mr speaker
gentle lady.
Mr speaker demonstrate they
not be present at those
committee meetings okay thank
you Mr speaker gentle lady so
then it would anyone else get
access to this report other than
the legislative finance
committee Mr speaker thank you
report okay thank you Mr speaker
gentle lady so that report would
not have any.
But information regarding these
structures and then that so of
those are being properly kept by
the committee Mr speaker gentle
lady.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentlemen that's what I cost so
gentle lady is I Costa a
contractor with the state is it
a private entity with where is
this from Mr speaker thank you
Mr speaker thank you gentlemen
this is the department at New
an individual from my because on
the board as well is that
correct Mr speaker.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you gentlemen yes actually the
representative from my because
Like a Big Brother kind of
committee I guess the worst
would be Mr speaker gentle lady
this would be to make sure that
everything is flowing correctly
throughout the departments and
we're not necessarily targeting
compliance with state laws Mr
speaker gentle lady.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentlemen so what the committee
remain secure and private.
Okay thank you Mr speaker gentle
lady and then so I'm getting my
last questions here I promise so
Mister speaker gentle lady would
at those other I guess kinds of.
External.
Solutions to making sure data is
stored safely securely and then
would be assigned to look at the
Costs and processes necessary to
centralize the storage and
protection of data.
keeping them sealed for you know
protective orders things like
this Mr speaker gentle lady
would we be doing anything
different for our.
Our judicial branch of
certainly be exploring and
understanding of how their
systems operate and how they
might be effective effectively
integrated with other systems.
Thank you Mr speaker will
gentlelady yields.
Thank you Mr speaker yes I will
yield to the gentle lady from
Santa Fe thank you thank you Mr
better or helping to to get it
to seven.
Amendment said that that help me
understand it
I just wanted to point out that
Would they be one of the
agencies the advisory committee
would be us to disclose their
data handling process and would
benefit them.
certainly be one of the agencies
that the committee would query I
I think there.
Yes thank thank you to delayed
is justice to offer you the
and I really appreciate the time
to speak and I appreciate your
thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady there's further
debate the gentleman from Lee
Representative Scott.
the gentleman from Lee.
Sure the gentle lady from.
Concerns.
We may be.
chairman.
Yes.
Systems.
This is a massive project.
J. for example IBM data systems
and others to perform the
services and build up the
systems on commercial basis
in New Mexico and that actually
has done this for the United
Nations and is also doing other
projects so they have this
A proponent of trying to
reinvent the wheel that's
already rolling.
To qualified companies already.
Yes.
And.
will still require some sort of
similar process to what I just
described before we move
anything forward thank you Mr
yield thank you Mr speaker yes I
will yield to my neighbor thank
you so
I guess I need an answer on was
do a consulted on this.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady they.
The word spoken with and said
that they were neutral.
other conversations I've had
they haven't said that
addition the need for the data
sharing because we heard about
it all through the interim you
know we need fifty yes needs
no with the health department
needs to know you know there's
don't have open meetings but I
guess my concern is the.
How safe is going to be and I
understand Mexico tech is a
wonderful university I guess the
actually has extensive
experience working with the
military and the intelligence
community so I we should feel
confident in their ability.
that can lady Mr speaker kind
lady.
From a data element to a report
or from one system to another.
speaker madam and Mr speaker and
gentle lady knows not under this
is setting up a committee to
moving around Mr speaker can
committee so we identified
processes what does that mean.
would be how an analyst would
take the data use it synthesizes
and then.
And.
One more question Mr speaker
Lady the I do.
I can't believe I'm gonna say
this I do agree with
Representative Scott in there
a disinterested party that has
experience and also isn't
promoting their own system
And I costs was actually created
heard of a casa
I still have concerns about do
it not having a place in this
order I know they're on the
committee but there are
information systems department
system because that's a lot of
data that's a lot of.
Important information the
structure and the systems but
thank you.
Thank you Mr speaker yes I will
yield to the gentle lady from
Eddy and Lea.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady so it appropriations and
finance committee
This bill sounds really good on
its face what could go wrong
with data sharing Mr speaker and
involving data per se but just
looking at frameworks Mr speaker
and gentle lady I can see down
the road that this is.
citizens and Mr speaker and
gentle lady I'm just concerned
that it's not always good that
the government knows everything
and all that and maybe that's a
good thing maybe it's not that
there are other ways that I
believe down the road in the
future this could be used
agencies but to have an overall
slate of our data about every
citizen that I I am concerned
about and for that reason I will
Thank you Mr speaker yes I will
yield to the gentle lady.
I'm reading one of the first
questions I have is regarding
the appointment of the secretary
didn't you point to the
two would secretary or their
designees.
Mr speaker gentle lady
Think about that be in the for
the in the amendment the other
thing that we do should look at
is it's one of the agencies in
information that is not subject
to disclosure and and.
The study committee a group that
is then put together through
single governmental agency is
acquired to do that is
participate in the open meetings
act so my question to you is how
would the public know what is
going to be released some of the
members of the specified members
but it didn't say to the public
so let's tell us about what
you're thinking thank you Mr
speaker and thank you gentle
The medicine that the public
could not come to the meetings
where the information and the
and the concepts of being
actor that is very well versed
in certain.
Matters might be able to take
Mr speaker and gentle lady my
question to you is that
individuals who are sitting on
this committee this group are
they going to be required to
speaker gentle lady what action
have a representative from every
single agency on this committee
because there will be talking
committee of that size would be
rather unwieldy however the
committee will be reaching out
to reach out to and and talking
Mr speaker gentle lady one of
the things that you did point
out is that a member of this
committee will be someone from.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I
don't believe that there's
someone from corrections
a representative of the state
courts and someone appointed by
the New Mexico sentencing
commission.
So Mister speaker gentle lady
one of the concerns that was
the.
The state office of the courts
is already participating in.
Mr speaker and gentle lady and
already exist.
Mr speaker gentle lady one of
the bigger concern is again
going back to those who are
participating in public safety
that area was included as a
member of this committee but not
not summon as general as the
taxation and revenue committee
speaker thank you gentle lady I
would say that you know what
we're trying to do is
find a better way to make data
informed decisions in the long
areas how can we integrate data
so that we can make better
informed decisions.
Mr speaker gentle lady my last
organizations like to read which
is our responsibility is to know
about data in every single state
agency in the state of New
you please explain that thank
you Mr speaker and thank you
gentle lady so once again I
would say that I casa New Mexico
tech is a disinterested party
there neither the executive the
with the intelligence community
and with some of our own
agencies.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
certainly.
There's a debate the gentleman
from Bernalillo Representative
Matthews.
Thank you Mr speaker yes I will
yield to the gentle lady from
Bernalillo
I've I've heard of Mr speaker
going on to your knowledge.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady well I do know of
one effort that was started
we could at least better
integrate data within the
criminal justice system.
there is another effort.
called the family success lab
which is trying to integrate
over the years thank you and
Mister speaker gentle lady have
any of those to your knowledge
been successful.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady yes.
is making progress and actually
I kaso works with them.
met Mr speaker gentle lady by
gentle lady if that had been
achieved we would not need this
committee.
Thank you for that answer Mr
speaker Mr speaker gentle lady
survey something like five
hundred agencies is that
correct.
state agencies and cities and
counties it certainly could be
upwards of that but as I said
the committee is going to start
with the state agencies and
build out from there.
you expect this project if it
moves forward add to would tack
when will this project be
complete and what with the
gentle lady that this is a two
year project given the sort of
enormity of the work to be done
and what.
What will it be able to do all
the data the.
Entered will it be and will you
fully integrated that we can
work with but the first step
actually is to understand what
data platforms and systems are
out there what are the different
Mr speaker gentle lady I hear
from that answer is that in two
years we're not going to have a
actual functioning data system
will have kind of a platform
us some of us on the phone
dollars Representative.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
kind lady you.
Thank you Mr speaker I will
think the idea is wonderful I
think we have the right
organization I Costa sounds
wonderful I really think it
ought to go through do it I
think that are to be the lead
is kind of beyond me Mr speaker
and it the expertise lies and I
Costa why don't we just use
icasa.
We are using I. casa but we want
the committee to be more
inclusive than just icasa or do
it.
money for it but it took is I
think a year and a half to get a
new director of IT and then in
the meantime other people quit
and then we had an advisory
board that was supposed to be
Scott to it it's it's we know
what we want is sounds like
everybody knows what you want
and the a you have the
institution in the state that
can do it.
Mr speaker gentle lady when was
do it formed.
thank you Mr speaker gentle lady
there is a problem that needs to
be solved and we have a
proposal that.
done it for other organizations
larger and smaller and.
That is why we're proposing
this.
Mr speaker and kindly I I
For the majority member you are
presenters mall.
Thank you Mr speaker with the
examples to sort of go through
my mind Mr speaker gentle lady
is there another comprehensives.
the honestly Mr speaker gentle
lady I don't think that answer
really surprises me Mr speaker
gentle lady we've done a lot
over the last few years made a
the unfortunately does.
Doesn't surprise me Mr speaker
and gentle lady the speaker
gentle lady you've talked about
a few of the benefits I'd like
gentle lady I do want to go
through some examples as well to
sort of ask of those might apply
and you can talk with your
expert about.
Mexico the opportunity to study
how state and local
jurisdictions are managing and
sharing data it will provide us
with a better understanding of
the overall analytics in order
around us and having a committee
catalog and assess what we have
and what are best practices and
what we need to do to ensure
lady that that's really helpful
to me is Mr speaker gentle lady
the the sort of governance.
Aspect in the fact that whether
there municipalities counties
others are dealing with that Mr
speaker gentle lady as we move
more infrastructure funding out
as we create more pathways for
coming back in Mr speaker and
gentle lady and that Mr speaker
gentle lady that's not the
personal data of of that you
leverage and work with the state
on is that fair Mr speaker
gentle lady thank you Mr speaker
yes I would say that that's fair
Mr speaker gentle lady in in
what we're investing in what
we're doing here is a state Mr
speaker gentle lady the fact
that your acts for in a dissent
arrested party who nonetheless
introduce larger entities
smaller good approaches to this
data integration and data
protection Mr speaker gentle
lady will this fundamentally
fact with this probably help the
state as at B. better prepared
to keep our data safe Mr speaker
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentleman yes this will
certainly help with our criminal
justice reform efforts.
and licensing and with others Mr
speaker gentle lady.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentleman that is our
understanding asked Mr speaker

not individual data it's a best
practices approach Mr speaker

frequently and was a put in with

the fact that there is been a

university excuse me.
Is really a center of excellence
and International Center of

speaker gentle lady those are
great reasons for me to look at
this and then finally Mr speaker
gentle lady what we see coming

is going to be out there our

make good decisions and I am
