thank you committee members
Representative little is like to
do pass.
Okay the.
Here is.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative for settlement
includes.
So few questions here regarding
page eleven.
Do with paper ballots marked by
voters
your digitized Quincy's and
records relating to the Senate
from third party inspection.
Except as otherwise provided in
the election.
Ninety days before the election.
Because west manager.
This material because what's
happening to the course is
indeed with different class and
is.
Able to complete their election
duties
during the election there is a
block of lack of carries a
We'll be able to complete their
election related duties however
actually turn on time we have to
start planning for the
elections.
This is trying to create a
first efforts to complete their
duties however after the
election we created a long
runway especially for paper
ballots and all of the various
related to campus where people
can request in fact be able to
inspect it is
we wanted to find the space that
people can
Val to look at the results but
not have it was erected in
eighteen.
Because many of our clerk's
staff of fabulous very
burdensome for us to be able to
complete some of these very
expensive a request and we'll
try and prepare for elections
thank you madam chair thank you
Representative and Madam.
According
to
my question then with the.
Since you just.
For a longer period of time the
clerk would extend out of time
you Sir the ballots and the
information from that election
chair representative madam chair
for.
After.
yes so essentially we have
extended period of time that he
would preserve records so that
way we are creating more space
for people to be able to look
after the fact
one of the things that's sort of
I think you confusion in the
lection code is that we actually
to our results come from Kansas
is here is not that close the
website Google website is sort
of the courtesy unofficial
results because you have those
on election night but the real
work and results come from all
of us had ever taste all of the
materials and that's what we are
preserving so that people can be
the ones the canvassing board
has.
Okay thank you madam chair
representative so that regarding
what is it for a full what would
now be exempt from the in this
renewable Madam chair
representative and chair
representative it's so for the
period leading up to election
and one with and so we're done
with the campus
essentially the committee to
election related material would
not be able after anything we
have related to actions
particularly this is what we
clarified balance themselves
permits applications any paper
materials all the materials that
we use to determine the results
that we sent secretary St that
we want we want to review and
make sure our election those are
the things that you should be on
a one should be auditing in
order to determine if we
correctly found the result thank
you madam chair thank you
Representative so with this now.
So it sounds like what you're
saying is it's just exempt from
sixty days after the election
however you could obtain that
after those sixty K. yes chair.
Your.
This.
Thank you madam chair thank you
representative madam clerk so.
I just wanna be crystal clear
there's nothing at all that
would change in the.
From what you currently could
get.
Right now I'm chair
Representative
So I think.
There is a big mess in the
current for a bill so we are
clarifying what details are to
be reserves which are what we
can use for determining results
and things that are peripheral
to voting for the digital
equivalents what we have we're
not allowed to get rid
additional public don't have a
paper.
So the idea is that we would
keep the paper going
particularly with the use to
determine the results that we.
Us review but we're clarifying
that you do have a for for the
land that is impossible in
additional to the left is not
you too Sir Madam
okay thank you representative
Madam chair representative.
This gets kind of this business.
So okay so I could technically
after election thirteen the
ballots and the stands of each
ballot and compare the scans to
whatever came out on the tape
Madam chair representative
correct Madam two week not every
county keeps the images of the
policy you would want to look at
the physical paper ballots in
order to determine if the
tabulator tapes Nash's thank you
madam chair representative so I
believe right now it's twenty
one months that they must be.
currently a state senator
Representative is twenty two
months for any election or
federal candidates on the ballot
if there is local elections
sixty days and then if it's a
if there is a judicial inquiry
for instance thank you only this
right after the final the final
determination from judicial
inquiry thank you madam chair
thank you Representative and
then quicker so then this would
extend that to a hundred twenty
K. for the local election is
that correct.
It was the.
Sixty days because it is
currently forty five days madam
chair.
Okay thank you madam chair
representative so I does the
sixty day extension for.
The the press.
Does not extend all the time
frame for local elections
current madam chair members the
committee currently is forty
five days or extended to sixty.
On it.
Thank you madam chair
representative I believe those
are all the questions I had to
see the answers thank you.
You.

table for to pass and the

Sure we are all looking into

Hey.
Right now.
I don't know how much of the US
right to repeats
For the folks with us the state.
One forty three in the binder
was split into two bills.
So many sub one the committee
contains the charters use
elements.
NASA though we are just just.
Yes I changes.
The need is second to recall
have added.
Here we stand question okay
representative Jeanne Ives
quickly review the bill she was
absolutely thank you thank you
this bill addresses loopholes in
our charter seeks to.
They were flagged in LFC program
that we we should be two
thousand fifteen and in two
thousand twenty two so this bill
proposes to fix some of the
problems.
We need to recognize it
somewhere Turner school orders
from that schools in the state
this bill in no way is an intent
to limit our current or the
creation of new term.
It is have to fiscal hole in the
lease process.
page for the three zero to
aftermarket.
Hesitant there is but creators
educators.
We will be closed in the lease
process because that's not side
of their area of expertise.
There was originally language in
here that said there will be
standardized lease used for all
these years revision of Bill but
that has been taken out in the
negotiation and consultation
with charter schools that we've
had over the last three percent
it said the leasing situation to
bury the kinds of buildings and
situations is too broad the
standard leases and work in our
public school facilities were
already has several conflicts of
different kinds of leases that
they provided me which was
taken.
He's not.
There is some language stricken
because part of what.
Valuations town.
Is that lease payments
Well part of the issue with
lease payments is if they are
used to improve.
Recommendation of a privately
owned building.
It's a charter school moves or
closes the state has lost that
investment so it's an issue
about the funds
I would note if you look on page
eight.
This is a new charter schools
shall not opened so this section
doesn't pertain to charter
schools that already exists
there seems to be some confusion
about alternative schools now
Senate we have to be at our
medium standard.
Conditions.
And that's not the case it's
just new schools charter schools
open the the issue for that
average target.
To make sure their conditions
are at least average I have
heard that so folks say that's.
An unfair standards because non
charter public schools
obviously don't have to be in
the average standard right fifty
percent schools are below the
average that sounds Adams.
But that's where you need to be
clear that this pertains to New.
New not heard public schools.
Our kids at the new standard
there the highest level
not.
We're we're asking new charter
schools to aim for the average.
I'm.
Next to next new languages page
eleven.
Negative in language that
already exists the only addition
is or just an easy way.
So it setting a person shall not
serve as a member of the
governing body or is an employee
of a charter school.
If that person intermediate
family members in owner agent
contractor has financial
interest in that by the building
of the charter schools.
That's a little bit has cost.
Some problems in the past.
there is a waiver process.
Then if there's a conflict of
interest there he can be waived
that waiver process exists in
the section and still exists
with taking.
Is that a as.
Thirteen.
The language.
Is in section four that starts
with the chartering Authority
shell.
This is a list of the
responsibilities of the
chartering Authority.
That oversees charter schools
and says they should annually
review creating forms conflict
of interest disclosure.
That that is part of their job.
The sixteen and seventeen.
It's to the proximate.
The public monies provided its
lease payment plans to charter
schools are used for the lease
and not used for this is top of
page seventy operational
expenditures property taxes
utilities custodial fees
insurance repairs those are
gonna actually lease rate.
Okay those are the changes that
were in the statute.
Is that sufficient madam chair
and thank you Representative.
It is yes please from LFC is
here to answer questions in
particular about what the LFC
flagged as these issues
this was came out of LESC
interim discussion see filled
that.
Thank you.
Thank you so we did hear public
comment on Friday so today I
would like to see hands raise
for those in support of this
bill.
Okay and if.
Opposition to this bill please
raise your hand.
Okay I'll go to the webcast of
we would like to see hands
raised or those in support of
this bill.
And those now opposition to the
bill.
Okay committee members.
okay so those are in opposition.
Okay.
All right thank you.
The Representative Zamora thank
you madam chair representative
as for the.
All right.
Okay
So what we're talking meeting
conditions for the schools.
What's the relationship and
safety.
To conditions for those.
What the New Mexico in New
Mexico called and and see it is
used across all the schools in
the state charter and charter
madam is.
And I would have to look up to
give you the criteria but they
have a whole list of criteria
that they use across all those
tools do you know more of.
Madam chair representative of
the condition index looks at the
entire facility and measures
whether it's up to educational
adequacy standards they take so
much it would cost to repair the
building devided by how much it
would cost to replace it is so
you can score yeah the security
section like and secure that
signal on education cameras are
part of that building that's
counted with that issue.
Includes the entire facility
including security
infrastructure and and madam
chair Mister of what point
States say somebody's of
starting new charter school and
go to this bill.
These.
To qualify for state money to
use as a lease do they have to
have security in place for those
students.
Madam chair representative.
I do not know the answer to that
question what they do know is
the statute does change that
criteria or policy so.
It's it's not in this building
some Madam chair representative
so that that leads us to.
If we're gonna limit.
The lease money to these and
nothing to do with repairs are
fixing on the screen.
How are we going to keep those
in state.
If it means security operations.
Madam chair and representative
that's an excellent question you
got but if we're going to open a
new school we're going to make
sure all of those things are at
that as a standard we're open
new schools and work that are
self averaging.
Exactly the reason and madam
chair representative so then.
What about the schools that
already exist.
So they have to divide by the
new rules now.
And the.
Madam chair representative on
page.
Eight.
Language in there.
This is a new charter.
Yes the standards.
Okay.
And the.
They're currently there's a
process which charter school
conditions are review.
We're not changing that process
for schools exist.
Okay.
That's all the questions for the
manager.
Thank you Representative.
Thank you madam chair thank you
madam vice chair next for so
question regarding.
The issues that stem to create
this bill do we know
specifically how many charter
schools and state have these to
problems.
Where we drafted this chair
representative.
Madam chair I will let her
witness answer that but if I may
want to add something to
Representative to the answer to
Representative so Moores
question at the top of the page.
This does pertain to current
charter schools if the bill came
to a new bill so the new charter
school or regional Katie where
they're going to get a new lease
and the renewable sector yes
okay.
Madam chair representative of
these issues service about ten
years ago and in two thousand
fifteen evaluation where there's
concerns that lease payments to
charter schools or far nexus of
what was
the leases of a flag the number
of charter schools that had
larger than disabilities that
may not work the average for
most students and so there are
concerns about that and the
tension of the you know whether
the state was getting the best
return on getting these lease
payments
assistance other schools.
Ten years later the state
honored in a special audit on
one of the school's classroom
that shin and found that they
were using their lease payments
to give the onus is to their
employees and we've looked at
this current lease payment
schedules for these charter
schools and if you look at your
FIR on the fiscal table we
estimate that about nine million
dollars of the current lease
payments going out aren't excess
of what it might cost to lease
cars.
That could be a potential range
of funding that might go into
things.
Base rent or lease payments
exactly so this bill attempts to
try and ensure that funding is
not being used.
Please.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative.
So can you tell me that.
I just I want to know if this is
like a like an epidemic or fifth
this is only very specific to
Google charter schools.
In this report were there a swab
of charter schools that were
affected or was it only a couple
of years Madam chair
representative.
Madam chair representative issue
with changing the statute is to
preventive and make sure that
guardrails there
that it's happened once is
unacceptable if we can.
If you want to add.
Madam chair representative of
the concerns that there wasn't
any oversight by the state and
on this issue and.
There is the more the more
instances the happening of the
bill does attempt to try and get
more opportunities for the state
flag it get more eyes on the
issue it may not be as quite
widespread as we may be
concerned about but does need
mitigate some of that.
Thank you madam chair
representative and expert so can
you tell me.
This I'm just trying to find H.
numbers the report that's due I
believe and never have to be
given page thirty thirty thank
you some investors
so this report what what it
includes I don't see too many
specifics on.
What information it requires
regarding these conflicts would
need the names of the parties
would need specific property the
amounts etcetera what what would
this require madam chair
representative.
Madam chair.
Mr Liu and that that the
conflict of interest disclosures
there are ready made they're
already in the system so this is
a request that they be reviewed.
The least once a year.
yes madam chair representative
we go go back to page ten and
eleven for section.
There's already existing
statutes.
Here are.
Campos and interests but it
doesn't really specify.
Explicitly.
Who should be the cost of
insurance leading to make any
explosives.
The session just.
Any charter school that has.
that.
Contract for a.
By the charter school forty.
Department of the body's
position on procedure in place
that's explicitly saying office.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative so I I get
the part about the next is this
really.
But I don't think this is tied
in language to taxes to desist
immediately family member.
And I know that you're going on
my cousin works here my uncle or
you know whatever so it's not
exactly all the media stand.
Impacted madam chair
representative so given concerns
about that with this bill not be
tight enough.
Madam chair representative well
that was the purpose of adding
or as an employee as we thought
that was a large loophole that
was left on state.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative.
Okay.
So I mean I get the point of
this bill I I like a lot of
questions of it with some
questions do a little heartburn
relief to.
With the amount of money to
please can spent on buildings
for instance and I know that
charter schools are charter
schools because they're not.
Traditional public schools and
they may need certain.
Disabilities are functions like
science labs or things that make
them that much different than a
regular everyday high school or
middle school so.
Do any comment on that as to.
Getting a little more
flexibility not just with this
index Representative.
Well I have to madam chair have
flexibility because they are
hubs of innovation in education
and if they have a focus area
that the CTE of occasional
focused or they might be as you
said last time we focused or
they could have.
Right here are still need
different kinds of leases still
in.
Bill so we don't if we don't
have too much that's why this
bills being paid out of a lot of
New Mexico Association.
But we do have to set the
cardinals the public monies and
make sure that
we have put in the guidelines.
Use.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative.
So in order to see that I think
the current status as a
reasonable.
A lease payments.
For yes so that not.
Is reasonable.
The more.
Term I get to say.
And I get the comment on that
directors and Madam chair
representative I'm gonna let
expert witness talk about half.
Madam chair representative yes
this.
Is the council of our guidance
on how to go about determining
what's reasonable there's always
of course different market
factors that are happening in
different regions of the state
reasonable life in.
The average across the state
which you know might be some
others effective localized to
certain geographic costs.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative.
Yeah I I get it I understand the
point but I also see there's
other language here provided
that the payments do not exceed
the some of the least
reimbursement rate provided a
paragraph one of seven
subsection one which says.
The subject of federal and state
laws I believe.
So I mean I guess that there's
already laws that required this
kind of disclosure and so I
just.
Just having a little trouble
hearing why we needed the cap
these people to the local market
right if they do have specific
needs computer systems no there
it's right kind of focus school
I just.
You know I have concerns I
understand why people have
concerns of this bill because
that but I also think that it's
very good that we have this.
Nine nepotism language which I
agree with so thank you madam
chair thank you Representative I
appreciate the input and the
thought process behind this
bill.
Chairman that point.
It doesn't.
Very very quickly yes yes madam
chair so I think as a committee
and and what we're doing law
like this I think we ought to
look at nepotism.
Closely because there's
communities in the state of New
Mexico for families live.
And they have settled in these
in these communities over
centuries all over.
Several generations.
And.
I'm thinking of.
Vonn and see no I in my district
Santa Rosa.
And I think if the nepotism is
too tight.
We're not gonna have enough
people employed at the school we
we have to be careful with that
and I don't really know what the
waiver is honest and how relax
that is or how tight that is but
there are communities for.
A lot of people are related and
and a lot of people and if we
start taking them out of those
communities are not.
providing jobs of those
communities I think I think
we're going to run into some
problems and I understand that
PED is part because there's been
problems with that before in the
past that's why this came up.
But
Just just a statement chair okay
thank you Representative Rehm
and then I have Representative
on in or you.
Thank you madam chair.
So.
Salim was.
Madam chair and then vice chair.
Why do we need this the system
dress a certain problem.
It was be honest about what it
is.
Madam chair and representative
it is to address a problem that
is happened.
Full of wide open space where
future problems can happen if we
don't put guardrails around.
And madam chair and now vice
chair I agree totally with
these.
We have seen.
It does
the public school system.
As we've gotten numerous
examples of it and I have yet to
see one piece of legislation
come here to go ahead and
address that.
And this one incident yet one
bad actor and by god we're gonna
drop the hammer on every charge.
And I find that will sensitive.
Frankly you know I think that
there are parts in here that I
agree with with nepotism.
But I'm gonna go through and ask
you some stuff was going and
talk about public schools Mr S.
expert you have any public
schools and let's just take
Albuquerque that would be
substandard.
Madam chair representative
could you clarify which means
less of state all know you're
using madam chair experts here
using the standard here that
they've got a B. average or
above okay that's your standard
are there any schools in
Albuquerque right now that are
below average.
Ma'am public schools and Madam
chair representative yes there
are significant number I'd say
probably about half of the top
one hundred schools need
replacement or not.
And madam chair and now vice
chair who typically goes to the
charter schools are they kids at
risks their risk of dropping
now.
Madam chair representative are
charters again serve all kinds
of kids all across the state all
kinds.
And madam chair and madam vice
chair I do that I see a lot of
kids that are at risk at those
schools and you know keeping
them in the system the the
traditional school is not
working so I think we have to
look at if we if we tighten down
the reserves to tied on the
charter schools that we have are
at risk of more kids not
graduating.
And I think that's an important
thing to look at I spoke with
one star Brooks about it you
know what is your plan because
even if you agree with me many
of the kids that were at charter
school where kids traditional
school work.
The license so what your plans
to address that group of kids in
the didn't have a and that's
where the charter school a man
now I agree with you that
there's some charter schools use
takes some of the science and
technology that are very
xcelerated and taking care often
in a specific area but what's
what's going on was what that
this over here.
So if we look at page four and
the new language.
So we're gonna have the school
is gonna be the local market
right.
So.
Madam chair and Mr expert how is
you determine the local market
right.
Madam chair representative the
public school out of the council
will look at others.
The.
In the local area.
And that'll allow them if you
were.
I was there for the time.
Madam chair madam by here so
what they're looking at is the
other schools.
In that area what their pain
versus what is of if you will
they can business buildings
commercial buildings Senator.
Madam chair representative.
Sunny take a crack at this.
Madam chair representative
services language sent
authorizes the council to do
this they may not choose to do
this.
General is that if the school
the cost of please or a certain
formula based on their own
result.
If there is an instance where a
tire might be leasing a building
that way out of whack they might
be able to leverage this
additional provision in statute
to say we have the authority to
set a lower rate that's
compatible with markets if
factors in our case.
Is there any way were.
From.
Whatever this.
Market rate is.
Madam chair representative madam
chair districts with our madam
chair and sunny feel free the
policies that I'm chair
representative once again this
is the name of the council most
likely and I have talked with
the this is a staff they
indicated that returning a local
market rate would be very
challenging and therefore you
would probably not leverage this
option unless it was.
Completely.
In order to hear so for most
instances they would stick to
their normal formulaic approach
to this.
Well madam chair and then a by
here kind of what you.
Explained this is somewhat of
abstract but what's which talk
about another issue so madam
chair Mr expert.
Are most of the charter schools
in a.
In a commercial building that
they of remarks.
Madam chair representative it's
a very large mixture of all
different types some are in.
Building somewhere and private
facilities some are sublease
from another charter schools all
across the board I think the
numbers that I.
Facilities but.
And madam chair Mister X. for
them what you're just mad of
those that are in a.
School building when they moved
in.
And I'm talking about a public
school.
Exactly where it is or you know
whatever for whatever reason the
moved into that.
Madam chair representative I
don't have that information from
the but I can follow.
Madam chair and Mr Burciaga
please.
Because I I the charter schools
survive all visited they for a
commercial building and
remodeling that.
And I think that has to come in
to the cost as.
You know if we're gonna if we're
gonna move industries into
something we need to have that
so let's go over to.
Scrubber to page nine winds five
through eight where we're gonna
strike which.
And madam chair and
Madam vice chair we've
established that we have schools
in Albuquerque that are still
below average.
What we want to go ahead and
make charter schools make sure
that they can't there's up to at
age.
In eighteen months if they get a
new new location.
I see I see that it's kind of a
conflict.
Do you understand.
Representative please clarified.
So.
Of them vice chair currently we
agree that there are schools in
Albuquerque that are sub
standard.
Just below average I should be
usable average.
Anyway there below average well.
With this language the stricken
so I will get ability that I
want to come in and of move it
charter school in there's no you
don't allow that time frame to
bring it up to average.
Yes if I'm gonna read ability
they're gonna want they're going
to want to sign contract they're
gonna want money down and then I
go in and remodel it to bring it
to this point one of my take
what the sixteen eighteen months
that you're striking.
Madam chair representative I
would remind you that we were
comparing charter and non
charter schools.
The word new.
Madam chair representative
because you will our build new
so they're already at the top.
When we talk about existing
schools there are many below
average that is the way it is
but this particular language
contains two new ones in the
situation we're trying to avoid
here is a charter school making
at least for the facility it is.
Not at that average standard in
the hopes that is the plan that
they can bring it up.
Warning the necessary funds into
it.
If those are state public funds.
If they don't meet that accuracy
than the students continue
forward in in this will that has
publicly supported into it and
it's still not even the average
stand.
We want don't want folks back in
the least in the building that
cannot be that level sourcing
star and the actors then if you
need to revamp it and add to it
so be it it should be good for
years into the future but if we
just payments can be used for
repairs if we don't want to make
a huge number of improvements.
That might be a lost assets it
that charter we located our
closest that's public money
boss that we shoot for that
average conditions starting
point to make sure public monies
are.
Madam chair and vice chair I
understand that you know that if
you came to a.
We'll see and I said I want to
write this we want to go ahead
and make it into a charter
school but if you need to
remodel it and have all this
done before I can even come and
give you any money.
I
think the guys gonna say yeah re
remodel with the we'll see what
happens.
You understand my point I do
Madam chair representative and
do understand there's no way
that this isn't going to make it
more difficult.
but it's part of the process of
putting guardrails around this
waiver process still exists on
page ten.
Seventeen twenty one.
The public school.
Yeah council.
To grant a variance so that is
protected still.
Madam chair of and madam chair I
think that's good but I think
what we ought to do and
language the state that
This is a new school going and
we understand there's gonna be
some upgrades you know things
such as that that you know a
reasonable time period to bring
it to standards.
Should be sure that of should be
included in this legislation
with and madam chair
representative the expert
witnesses reminding me that
there are two schools that have
the eighties.
Got into the leases reason maybe
the Bruins and still haven't hit
the mark and it had a waiver of
one or two what we have now and
they're not hitting the mark and
now that charter schools in
if they're in that situation.
Their stock
and and we want to prevent that
but the one hand okay.
Well chair.
Madam vice chair.
I think that it is appalling
that I know of at least one
school in Albuquerque where the
drinking water contains let and
the kids have to bring water
their own drinking water school.
And so if we're gonna ratchet
down here we need to ratchet
down on the other.
As well but let me go ahead and
move on.
So madam chair and vice chair
Senator top of page seventeen.
So.
Your lease payments can we'll
see we're not going to give you
money and leaves to go and pay
property taxes
Utilities or any of that so what
I could do.
Yes I go back to my original
page and asks.
Four and I say well what so here
is to me Hastert include
utilities property taxes all
that.
And that wouldn't beyond
reasonable.
At that rate.
You see I got around the.
Madam chair representative
you're proposing that they
include these things in the
eight and then percent families
to the public school governing
authority and council and say
this is the cost of the lease
actually these payments I would
say madam chair representative
that the lease payments are
calculated from the cost of the
lease for the based on student
enrollment square footage from.
Raul.
Formula and they use whichever
is lower so if they hi all of
those things and for these it's
not to be approved.
Of madam chair and
representative so.
When we look at for this is
approved by the public capital
outlay council of the local
market right.
What is the local market rate
for a commercial building that
includes property taxes and
utilities.
Madam chair representative go up
another line and go to may
they're not required to.
So again they'll hit that which
is lower based on student
enrollment or based on the
formula of those possibilities.
Madam chair representative by.
These are the reasons why can't
support the the changes to the
charter schools.
Thank you madam chair chair
representative I will say when
you're ready to do a bill.
To register on public schools in
these public disclosure areas
and
You Representative on your new
home thank you madam chair
Representative.
We get that this bills trying to
close the local office regarding
charter schools and I I'm all
for that but I was a little
concerned that he might also
this has been built a result
might be creating a double
standard where let charter
schools will get eight
assistance money if they don't
meet the traditional averages
we're talking about
but public school districts if
I'm understanding this correctly
the public school districts get
prioritize for additional funds
for not needing that same
average is that is that correct
Smith Madam chair representative
Mr.
Madam chair representative we're
mixing two things were talking
about repairs right conditions
of schools that already exist in
being prioritized for repair
money as opposed to this
language the setting the
standard for new schools so new
non public schools that are
billed by funding raising taxes
of their brand new top of the
line.
Actually the perfect connection
you know new convention we're
not asking that a new charter
schools for us and average
knowing that they are often
built from scratch there these.
Okay so the cost of repairing
and school equipment is the
a charter school moving into a
new facility that they before
starting happened you are
charged a long Madam.
Right okay I thank you madam
chair representative.
Thank you.
Committee members.
I have a couple questions on
behalf of my constituents and
I've been following along I just
want to hear you
and my constituents answered
this question can
so.
Why.
In or will this.
There is a conflict of interest
and lively and and where do they
apply to all school districts
charters are public schools.
Okay madam chair so we're
talking about the page thirteen
section.
Okay.
Madam chair conflict interests
disclosure for two years.
Are already million on the
previous page pages ten and
eleven this.
This is when there's a very high
in this.
This form the internet.
The statute was missing the
follow of language who's
supposed to look at how often.
To make sure everything is.
It's not saying that it can't be
as a conflict of interest as one
of the representatives pointed
out in small towns it's going to
happen it happened you can't
avoid it what somebody's looking
at these conflicts of interest
and noticing if something
doesn't seem right that
responsibility was never
assigned to anyone statutes
specifically so in section on
page thirteen we're signing on
to the tiring Authority that
governing body is similar to
that the school board.
The number of the school to say.
This is your job you look at
these.
Okay thank you and then I will
go to page.
Page nine.
again on behalf of my
constituents.
So we have an existing charter
school and.
And.
And we decide to.
That does not put them in the
category of.
Having to take two steps back
and get.
Get re evaluate.
Madam chair representative I'm
not sure I understand the
question thing so if the current
charter school wants to be
located to a new facility
they're getting a new lease on
that facility correnti to hunt
for a facility that means that
averaged.
Thank you.
Committee members.

Some of the other.
Okay representatives.
Welcome to our.
Long time no see.
Thank you madam chair thank you
let's do another one.
I am happy to bring new.
House Bill three hundred twenty
five which is the other have
leverage with.
And madam chair there is the
committees.
So if you would like to
distribute that everybody's
looking at the same thing.
This is the government's point.
You haven't will verify.
To to number.
Two six.
Okay thank you madam chair.

Move the committees number House
Bill three twenty five for
discussion in the to to number
is point four sixty eight point
two okay in a second no no no
man no man living.
Point two five three three zero
we dare to.
All right.
chair committee this is cool
school governance bill then
its drafted in response to get
into issues black in program
evaluations and LFC report two
thousand ninety two thousand
twenty three.
Recognizing the school boards
are crucial to a successful
school outcomes and the work
they do every day on behalf of
their communities is
fundamentally important so this
bill addresses issues around
transparency and around training
for these bodies of.
Taking you through it.
Section by section.
Page two.
There's language that this is
all current statutes this is
striking the bottom.
What happens now is the school
board candidates.
Have to disclose and report
their campaign contributions
only at their school district is
the largest national thousand
students.
Right now the state of New
Mexico that is for school
districts.
So eighty five or eighty nine
school district board candidates
do not have to report
contributions in the interest of
transparency and fair.
Communities of rituals New
Mexicans in small towns.
Deserve to know what campaign
contributions have been received
but if it is just as much the
people in large towns do so
we're striking that exemption.
And I just the declare your
campaign contributions the
finalized their.
Next.
This is on page four and.
If they can.
Brought a pastry inequities in
line nepotism is already.
We all know that and this is the
language in detail that
prohibits it the new language at
the top of page four allows a
waiver process so often district
has for.
Five hundred students they can't
recruit some qualified
applicants for positions they
can apply for a waiver.
Because as we discussed in the
previous down this is an issue
Moscow.
When the population is small the
hiring people were related.
Section B. as is new and that
it's a penalty for nepotism.
We are one of.
Hi I think ten states thirteen
states that have nepotism
prohibited.
But no penalty it's like we
forgot the other half of the
sentence.
The penalty is in line seven to
eleven.
Is the least smallest penalty
here to other states in two
states is.
Twelve states column demeanor I
states given the civil penalties
provide eleven states just say
you have to step down from the
board.
We went with that lowest penalty
there.
Next action is on page.
You know page four and page five
these two sections deal with
training for school boards
because their work is so so
important.
Section B. list some other areas
very performance driven.
Student performance driven.
Training that should be included
and I want to be absolutely
clear many many school boards
across the state of New Mexico
already include all of this
training.
But we are putting it in statute
because the central for the
school outcomes.
Homes we need in our state.
Next new section.
Thanks.
Actually is a repeat of the same
language just to cover.
Governing body for charter
school.
So school boards and governing
bodies for charter schools.
Need to include all of these
concepts in their training.
At the bottom of page five in
the bottom of the page seven it
says new material that is
requiring both entities public
school boards and governing
bodies for charter schools.
To webcast in our Hyde their
meeting in good government
transparency.
Those new sections of this bill
with that I apologize Madam
chair expert witness on my left
late in local from LFC we can
ask details about the program
evaluation point that like some
of these is an honorary co
sponsors Representative and
she'd like to say a couple words
Representative thank you madam
chair thank you members of the
committee I'd like to commend my
clothes.
Sponsored of reading this bill
forward I only have one regret
is that I need.
it's it's an amazing and and I
actually I actually signal after
all these years and I can't
believe I did not that that
school boards of less than
twelve thousand didn't have
filed financial reports it just
seems like they should be they
should have the same miles of I
the I to ask people need to know
where they get their money and
you know in as as the director
of the Landel foundation I
recruit thirteen school
districts in the north for for
seventeen years and
so I would go to everybody
school board meeting at least
twice a year if not more.
said market you know what our
job is to help our job wasn't
criticize you during the day.
Really I.
I've seen too many things that
have gone astray and I really
think this legislation would add
up an important step.
You know when that big money off
of that money through the
internet he's and it was
probably twenty years ago.
M. we have real problems with
big companies coming in selling
school boards huge products that
we're waiting on.
And the money was flowing I'm
just telling you.
I I couldn't prove it I can't
tell you but you know if if
there had been a long placing.
Got their money from what from
whom I guess I.
I think I think the stories
would have been different so I
saw people by.
Terrible products that were way
too expensive for a small school
district they installed and
later they didn't work we had to
bring in specialists to prepare
the programs to do it the right
way I mean it was just and it
was I'm not blaming any
People.
Making a decision.
No.
Passively.
That happens a lot.
Ninety and small schools it just
happens you know you you don't
know if you don't know all and
and
But in the as we got further
along we started to you know
give you my people to hire
experts to kind of come in and
help schools make decisions
we've got as a foundation that
was something we could do really
there are a lot of that is the
table that are pretty and that I
think this is an important
that's what I'm here to support
my.
My fellow Representative.
Thank you Representative all
right let's go to the audience
those and supported a bill
please raise your hands.
Okay groups in opposition.

At least elementary and
Services.
Educational institutions I mean
it many different levels of
taxes hi to.
Local schools and the other one
of the most important decision

that is fine.
Your call and.
Local school boards will be

They will have training and
support to inform both will.
Our schools and students for

This educators I work from four
other districts also support
this legislation as an
opportunity to support

comments Sir thank you madam
chairman especially them with
thanks to Mexico's strong
support this bill I want to
thank both of the co sponsors
who are here today and also
Representative Gail Armstrong
couldn't make it because another
co sponsor of the bill want to
emphasize this is a substitute
bill because we sat down
Representative Figueroa convened
all stakeholders and we make
compromises and took half of the
provisions that I know the
school boards association didn't
support
one of the ones they still it
sounds like Capitol Records with
is the disclosure of campaign
contributions and I would simply
say all we're doing this bill is
applying the same standards to
school board members that we do
the legislature's it's twenty
twenty three and it's time to do
this finally with regard to
training it's still around we're
here to tell you the average
tenure of superintendents is now
less than two years one of the
great things this bill does is
it allows for more coaching of
our school board members to
support hand supervised
superintendents help create more
stability thank you thank you.

Good afternoon madam chair
members of the committee I'm
cert sterile senior vice
president of the greater
Albuquerque chamber of commerce
without having seen the sub I'll
make my comments of what we
appreciated about the original
bill it sounds like the spirit
of that is still contained in
the substitute leadership
matters and it starts at the top
our local school boards set the
tone for district administrators
and our principals who lead
schools of hundreds sometimes
even thousands of kids this
legislation will help them
attain the skills they need like
an awareness of finance and
legal topics and the value of
data for helping students set
and reach academic performance
goals also helps hold them
accountable for their actions as
board members and as elected
officials our students families
families have a right to expect
their district leaders to give
them their best and this bill
creates new supports and
important consequences to help
board members delivered thank
you.
Next we have.
John.
Thank you madam chair and
members of the committee my name

Mexico we are here in support of
the committee order house bill
three twenty five of in
particular we also support the
transparency changes being
proposed around campaign finance
reporting more importantly on
the transparency front we
support the webcasting and
archiving provisions we feel
that this would go a long way to
help parents and community
members be more involved with
educational decisions being made
in their local districts or
public charter schools so we do
our support on this legislation
thank you.
Thank you Max have.
Vermonters.
And the.
Yes.
House.
Go ahead Mr Montano.
To all right let's go to the
audience for closing comments
the start of my right.
The manager of the of the
executive director New Mexico
school boards.
Position today represents the
voices of our eighty nine school
boards four hundred fifty
members elected members just
like you.
The original house bill three
twenty five but several extreme
actions that we disagree with.
we are pleased to report we're
able to.
Have all the two of the state
address.
Those issues in our discussions
with Representative
and of course assistance from
our school superintendents.
The.
Reporter for the training
requirements.
The mandatory assuming.
Meetings course the waiver
provision is.
Close to two items.
And the that those items are
the.
Campaign finance report is you
know school board member.
Of our non partisan in nature
very few of received
funding assistance during their
campaigns
several years ago we.
Established a task force of
legislators and the secretary of
state's office we're able to
come up with a bill that
addressed the five largest not
for largest five largest.
In the state of New Mexico those
currently report.
this will.
Applying this provision to all
school boards is unnecessary
it's it's cumbersome this
secretary of state's office has.
All agree on that.
By an act of the section with
this discouraging further limit
the number of candidates we get
for school board.
So we oppose this very.
Second both of I do that seven
million please quickly focus.
Sure.
This is current that is in
statute.
I had a penalty.
The there are exist the staff to
the provisions of superintendent
from hiring a media member of
the school board member.
We have worked with this
superintendents are well trained
in this point numbers notice we
have over the last two years
probably at.
I did tens of.
Board members resigned in order
for their they're a family to
take a position generally the
small rural community like
image.
There is no of a violation of
the statute and we ask that you
drop this particular items.

stage four line seven through
eleven just not necessary we are
voluntary I.
I with this decisions
association.
Thank you time next.
Please one minute madam chair
members of the committee on the
shows that thanks for New Mexico
coalition leaders who is
complies to school
administrators and
superintendents and we sat in
opposition for the same reasons
that the school board as we do
appreciate some of the and then
this and have been made but we
do have a service about the
penalty section and also really
about some of the advantage
mandates this is the place of
our administrations but we look
forward to continue working with
the sponsors thank you thank you
okay let's go to the left pass
will.
Do.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee my name is the
rain maker and I am with the
Lovington school board and I
currently serve as the president
of the New Mexico School
association I will repeat the
same opposition is that the
association stands with I
certainly agree with that whole
heartedly but the piece that I
really wanted to get into is in
regard to the campaign finance
when I look at the eighty nine
school districts.
Forty four percent of those
districts have student
population of less than five
hundred another fifteen percent
student population of less than
a thousand so basically spinal
sixty percent of our school
boards are a very small
communities I grew up in a small
community if you want to know
who what where when and how much
go to the post office go to the
coffee shop it's is there that
this is a punitive measure in
the small communities I ask that
the committee really reconsider
this piece of it yes thank you
very much all right let's go to
the website has.
Okay yeah I need stand to claim
thank you madam chair good
morning madam chair members of
the committee billing a or C.
system Mexico's politicization
of the Legislative eyes on and
I'm a former school board member
focuses on Community and I'm
going to repeat all this is an
entity and it's very important
depreciated staff but what I
would just like to say in terms
of this position is a volunteer
non paid
Position that you're doing for
the rest of the children in your
small community I come from M.
two of impose additional
requirements for your first
thank you for office I think
it's going to two of
Representative road to the pool

parents that are in the room for
these position positions working

my district that I represent but
I Representative eleven
thousand.

that I could get an online
receiving every bit of training
that I can get but to make it to
to be blunt thank you how much

to require for someone who's a
volunteer who doesn't receive

Next we have a mon mon tanto.
Good evening madam chair members
of the committee can you hear me
as well yes I I'm very concerned
with just the language used by
Representative saying that
school districts a lot of wasted
money by buying technology it
can prove it I was elected to
the board of education in a
rural community two thousand one
I was sure that every capacity
there the state levels the
president our service present my
local school board became local
school board Rio Rancho and
finish my career twenty nineteen
there are the amount of training
that point all.
I do every year we we all we do
it I had many many hours of of
of training if you want to talk
about transparency
House Bill to twelve.
I was on the board before
eligible to twelve and after and
I just think it's it's reckless
to start putting in are
requirements that are already in
place first of all and second of
all to make statements that are
factual don't have.
That to back that up as well I
attended LFC hearings recently
out to schools okay fine.
You will find Representative to
the state auditor of attorney
general's office so I'm asking
you guys to really consider what
you're doing today thank you
thank you next we have robin
would Millard.
Hello I am a Mexico resident I
went to school in northern New
Mexico to very small school and
I am against the this there was
a comment made about how small
school boards don't have the
knowledge to buy technology.
That is really putting people in
a box that should they should be
put in I know a lot of very
talented people and small
school.
On small school boards my Daddy
served many years on the school
board and if you put the
nepotism piece back into this my
uncle who was a screen for a
teacher for over forty years in
northern New Mexico would have
been able to teach I really am
opposed to this I'm against it
and I hope you guys really
considerate thank you for your
time thank you.
Okay a committee member's
Representative Zamora and then
Representative law.
Thank you madam chair.
In members
representatives for bringing
this bill forward.
We're not looking to rural New
Mexico with this bill on
nepotism.
What if somebody gets hired.
And then they find out.
Mr fire the school board member.
Correct and that the.
Madam chair representative the.
Order incident happened in the
ways I would point out that
we're adding additional.
That since in the past first
the.
Bill Clinton is a waivers in
those small communities both can
be hired I don't the school
board member having to step.
But if somebody's hired they can
fire the school board member.
If we don't get a waiver madam
chair that would that would be
correct Madam chair
representative appoint does come
in.
Madam chair representative.
The local page for the local.
LFC.
Nibert pages for the local
superintendent we find
qualification in requests the
department agreed with.
I don't like Madam chair
representative.
I don't like that you're still
far in the school board.
Members of.
Is there some way for them to
fix that somewhere along the
way.
Without that person getting
fired another question is
training how much training or we
mandating.
Madam.
There is no number of hours
increase in the number of our
the number of hours needed right
now the school board is five for
charter school governing bodies
thank you tend to Penzance
things we didn't change that
number of hours all.
So madam chair for is that not
in the building.
Madam chair representative.
Understand the question so so
you mandating training but you
didn't put them out of hours and
my correct.
Madam chair representative yes
the alors elsewhere in religion
the hours of this but I did
regulations so all of that this
bill does is they make sure that
in those hours you include these
topics in these topics are from
the national school board
association best practice list
so madam chair representative
than the training the answer is
five hours and.
Madam chair representative our
bill does not address numbers
ours at all so that's what
exists now but we're not
changing.
Okay.
Madam chair representative would
you be open to an amendment to
take out the firing of the
school board members.
Madam chair representative.
Or you know Madam chair
representative.
It balances the waiver I think
it's important that small
communities be able to hire
relatives of school board
members when it's necessary.
The penalty bounces that and
make sure that the nepotism
rules the courage's them to the
following and as we heard in
testimony Madam chair
representative fast Jori of
pieces.
People follow this rule.
So madam chair and
representative.
If the school board member.
If they hire somebody at the
school not not actually on the
school board.
A still pertains to these rules
right.
Madam chair representative I'm
not sure I understand the
question Madam chair of the
teachers related to hold more
member does.
Does it pertain to this bill.
Madam chair representative yes.
Madam chair and representative.
I like the bill.
I don't like that part of it I
think somehow we ought to fix
that.
For.
I know I'm in and I don't know
so much in Clovis the staff but
I know like in in the small town
of Melrose.
I know that that there was a.
The mother the daughter and the
daughter in law all working at
that school great teachers good
people.
And it takes.
In those those como communities
it takes that to be able to fill
in the spots for the teachers.
So I don't I don't think we're
looking at rural New Mexico.
Is there any way we can Madam
chair representative.
Make them relax Senator can make
it better for this bill Madam
chair representative that.
Already a long and my expert
witnesses chiming in.
I'm gonna let it.
madam chair members the
committee one thing to also note
is that if people work as as
teachers or in some capacity at
the district and then of school
board members elected that's not
nepotism it's only once the
school board member becomes
elected the superintendent is
prohibited from hiring an
immediate relative
for for through marriage
relative through marriage on to
the districts and Madam chair
representative that is current
law that's not what we are
putting in here that is already
in.
Madam chair and Representative.
Morning what if we allowed.
Two or three or or one or
something or we can.
Work with the small communities.
it's the same.
It's nepotism if we hire anybody
of that family.
Madam chair and representative I
think in some ways we're getting
it the same thing here that's
why the liberals as in and I'm
going to give us have that
Representative Armstrong she was
the one who advocated hard for
our rural communities especially
to add that we were in so that
if they district has fewer than
five hundred kids that so if she
finds the small districts where
this is really an issue to fill
those spots it's going to be
family members to allow them to
apply for a waiver to do that
without the school board member
having to step down.
Madam chair can we go to that
section and will read it sure
and if so what page top of page
for Medicare that starts on page
three page three.
What is.
So right now the superintendent
Emma.
Lawyers prove the improve the
initial one.
That was Madam I think it's
point one selected to the school
board and families already
working it doesn't come into
play.
But already here stated they
cannot play.
The person who is related to the
superintendent or the school
board member then we added the
waiver at the top of the page
for.
They they need to because this
town is so small.
They can provide proof of the
qualifications state the
teaching life.
And requests to waive it.
Two with the requirements of the
school board membership down.
So madam chair representative so
then the the person employed and
the school board member.
Both loser position right.
Correct it.
Madam chair.
Madam chair and and
Representative is this the first
committee this bill comes to.
Representative yes.
Madam chair and representative
All of us look forward to the
rest of the debate.
And see how this anymore as long
as.
Thank you madam chair
representative thank you
representative Representative
block thank you madam chair
thank you Representative I could
you tell me what the purpose of
this bill is a why did you bring
it forward initially Madam chair
representative.
Madam chair representative to
add.
The crucial importance to me
madam chair was to add the.
Hi.
The characteristics of good
training that many I was already
doing and making that clear to
all this.
To shine a light on
contributions because I do
believe that if you live in a
big city or a small city the
matter where you live in New
Mexico you deserve to see who's
contributed to your elected
officials can't pay.
Those were two big issues for me
that caused me to bring this
bill for
and I will say again madam chair
Representative Armstrong.
Eliminating the situation for
the rural school districts in
the need for that waiver also
seem to point to be very
important thank you madam chair
thank you Representative so
what.
Good training is not happening
right now in school boards
across the state it is number of
school boards that are not at
training Madam chair
representative Madam chair
representative I can feel the
expert witness again he's got.
So madam chair members the
committee
in a in at two thousand twenty
three program evaluation of the
school districts and empire have
program evaluations of school
districts
you know the these are best
practices that are identified by
the national school board
association and there's
academic research on what the
best practices are in need of
review of school board meeting
minutes the
Act report found that some
school boards could focus more
on some of these best practices
some school boards are doing
this out there but in this case
in this report we identified
focus on the more operational
and administrative decisions
rather than some of the
recommended best practices
regarding setting strategic
plans student equipment and
setting goals for schools.
Madam chair representative with.
Oil sands who is it hearing this
inconsistent and we wanted to
lay it out there and spell it
out these are the things that
should be included this is done
in conjunction with the national
school association and with the
agreement from our New Mexico
school boards association good
topics thank you Madam
Representative well I would is
that.
New Mexico school board
associations and parent vehement
disagreements with this
legislation Parly certain topics
to our concern.
So.
Representative yes the training
topics I'm not a point of
contention.
Thank you madam chair
representative but it's my
understanding that these are the
office.
By these
discourses madam chair and
representative these are made
available some school boards
take advantage of them some
don't.
We are encouraging school
boards.
By putting this in there to make
sure they all that is not here
is some school boards do some
don't.
But they do it to the level that
appropriate to their local
situation if their local school
board that decides the weight of
each of these topics what's
needed to power fits into their
I our monthly and that all
school board none of it is here.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative so you know I'm
just concerned about forcing
these folks to get this training
when it's already if it's
already available.
Hey can already get it.
The school board as we mentioned
earlier for small.
Very very hard to get candidates
to run for the.
At all Madam chair
representative however.
Where I live you know we have
the school board or school
district about fifty five
hundred kids it's a pretty big
school board district.
But we still have problems
finding people to run for these
positions Madam chair
representative so.
You know I think adding these
stumbling blocks on these
candidates this is mandated
requirements which also doesn't
have timelines kind of.
When these requirements have C.
but also.
Forces trainees chair
representative as we said before
these people are volunteers.
And they they work throughout
the entire year Madam chair
representative.
So I know that there's an
argument as legislators and get
paid whatever okay that's that's
a topic for another day but
specifically for the school
members.
School board members why is it
that we're gonna give them even
more stumbling blocks.
To Sir Madam chair
representative Madam chair
representative these are.
Positions the facts are student
outcomes tremendous.
And these are training topics
that are fundamental to their
schools and six staff.
By the national school boards
association.
This is from the list and these
are good things to.
The fact that we need them and
that they serve and the service
public health.
I hate putting in a lot of time
to this job.
But they're also collected and
therefore response so it's not
an obstacle it's a light in
terms of campaign contributions
which is think what you were
referring to in the second part
of the question madam chair
and it is.
Something on every New Mexican
deserves to now we have school
board members running through
campaign entirely with our own
funds.
Their community deserves to know
that campaign finance report
the.
Thank you Sir thank you
Representative.
Well we heard today over sixty
percent of our schools was it in
them.
Answer a lot of these.
Local school board districts
they they probably don't have
extremely competitive races
officers from some are more
competitive than others but
chair representative.
I mean I know as provided it's
hard enough to get Garcia
reports in on time and get it
done right and make sure we
don't have.
X. or Y. that we didn't do you
know for the smaller waist
smaller school board district I
I'm sure that there is a tiny
fraction of the population that
actually both in these elections
Madam chair representative you
know I I have not heard that
this is the problem.
Currently Madam chair
representative do you have a
list of.
Individuals across the entire
state that have problems with
this rural New Mexico
specifically chair and
representative there are five
for school districts there used
to be I therefore school
districts now that more than
twelve thousand students this.
You all are going to be
surprised enough that you can
need for.
There Albuquerque Los crucis.
Rio Rancho in gas.
Santa Fe drop the for the love
the twelve thousand mark.
But that means eighty five.
School districts across the
state or not
doing campaign finance report
and that means vast majority of
the state has no idea who's
contributed to the school board
members campaigns in our Hyannis
district I will tell you that
New Mexico statutory law one
there's twenty two dash eighty
one dash twenty two eight
extreme.
Already set the secretary of
state's.
section of Los that only
candidates to receivers spend
five hundred dollars have to do
a campaign finance report so
that would apply to school board
candidates as well as
entertaining as districts where
there is no one else running and
you're just struggling to get
someone to step up.
They're gonna fall in that
category I have to do this
sentiment thank you madam chair
thank you Representative well.
I don't know about that I know
that.
Campaigns are very expensive the
states.
And targeting voters as a lot of
money you know setting up one
piece of male is sixty cents per
piece and so you can hit that
five hundred very quickly
especially in these local
districts and then the time and
effort that would be needed to
put these reports together I
just feel like it's it's
burdensome to that but I I guess
we will not agree on that right
now but going forward in this
bill I see that includes and
performance based budgeting as a
mandatory requirement for
training.
You know I I would love this to
be at the PED level quite Madam
chair representative because
right now we just throw money at
things and expect results to
change we're still do it and
everything.
So I mean I guess I'll just make
that comment I just think.
If we're gonna put this to the
local school board district we
should definitely put that at
the top level as well Madam
chair representative I'm not
have any input on that.
Well I would need in order for
us to earn that section is the
departments of the bill of these
this section of training course.
Madam chair representative so.
Then going on to the next to
some part.
That to me no yes you know
everyone disagrees meant to them
we're on the same page there
but.
I see that this is
extraordinarily punitive the
school board member and the
individual not the
superintendent with higher than.
Madam chair representative.
Yeah madam chair representative
the superintendent hired and
fired five four we have
tremendous.
Over in the state are average
like the two years and there is
some use that correlates student
performance with longevity and
the superintendent we have to
give them better support and
keep them longer and the intent
of this.
Is to make sure the school board
doesn't lean on a superintendent
who in.
Across most of
their new their experience and
they are talking to their boss
and so that they are.
leaned on to hire family members
thank you madam chair thank
Representative well I just see
that there as we are today there
are been no instances where
there of ten violations of this
where the folks can resign or
make arrangements and so I don't
see the purpose of this
legislation I I'm trying to
figure it out but I don't see it
I get madam chair representative
the webcasting that's good more
transparency there I I think
maybe in larger school districts
maybe five thousand or more kids
having to report contributions
may be potentially but you know
I just feel like this
legislation.
It sounds great but in practice
it doesn't seem like it's going
to do much help to encourage
more people to run for this
before to stay on the school
board or if you're in a small
community to have family members
that work at the school board
that may be a driver of the
economy in those local districts
managed care I just I don't
necessarily see this point is
its registration thank you.
Madam chair representative I can
examples I did want to but A.
twenty twenty one there were
there in Los Lunas this was an
issue in twenty twenty two.
Covert consolidated school board
had an issue in twenty fifteen
not school in twenty fourteen
the Lawrence school board.
Aware of these those for us
today to do some research
because of I had the
Representative discussion so I
ask for this research service
for in the last six years the
eighty nine school boards but
thank you Representative.
I'm just saying well I got the
information once the decision
is.
That did not happen and I I
don't know about these for
individual school districts I've
I'm not gonna.
All encompassing receive review
the for all the school districts
across the state even if that
was true which I I don't know.
I don't think that this would
help that manager thank you.
Thank you Representative block I

Madam chair of.
Hi my name's anyway those of the
of the four years I've been out
all director for the state of
Mexico for the past six months
seven months I've been the
acting director for Candace.
So again I think the the
Representative is the this is a
clean up of and recently found
in the in the previous bill and
through implementation and will
kind of go through the we can we
can either use the the different
highlights of the different
changes but with me also is our
general counsel for Canada's up
Robert Sachs who's a graduate of
UCLA law school and he is the
subject matter expert in
cannabis in New Mexico he has
the respect of the industry and
he's been super helpful is one
of the first people we hired and
is that an amazing higher for
cannabis and so
I would I need a furry rightly
to him on a lot of language and
and a lot of interpretations
thank you madam chair.
Thank you thank you madam chair
thank you for that the section
that is Roberts accent happy to
be here your questions or happy
to talk about the first of.
Thank you let's go to the
audience now for those seeking
support Israel's right hand.
For those in opposition.
Okay let's start with supporting
comments please write your
comments within one minute
starting from my right.
Chair members of the executive
director New Mexico chamber of
commerce and register of this
organization as Representative
and he said this is a very
powerful bill that addresses
some of the issues we kind of
strangulation Act you know
points of clarification really
that we didn't know what we.
So one of the dogs Candace.
This is of the the right next
steps to ensure that the
industry can continue to grow to
grow as possible.
Thank you thank you.
Thank you madam chair standards
on contract.
Which carries general commerce
I just want to
Sentences thank you.
Three weeks.
After that madam chair members
of the committee and.
Of the alliance we worked
closely with the sponsors for
the passengers the cabins
regulation Act additional is
really critical the cleanup some
of those things that we know
where we stand up huge industry
are going to be things we have
to go back and look at it and
clean up I also serve on the.
Its regulatory advisory board
for the department and so.
Really strong support of this I
will note that there are a
couple of things from policy
alliance feels really strongly
about one is making sure smaller
Mexico based businesses.
In our State
Street road to reject this
general.
Thank you further comment
supporting the bill.
The New Mexico to elect.
So.
Sure.
I'm a small farmer in Valencia
County Bernalillo county and
tacos and the overall I think
this bill kind of causes
accomplish what the previous
people just said there are some
issues in the cannabis
regulation Fund Act that I
really can cover in a minute but
we already have chapters seventy
six article ten which is the New
Mexico State law and we have of
chapter seventy six article five
which is the plant protection
act and so currently how people
sell plants is they get a
producer Lysons and through RLD
and CCD and then they get a
nursery license that MDA and
those procedures are kind of set
in the proper direction act and
so we think the I mean I think
that there's like.
Consensual to not have some of
the pork in here the other thing
that's kind of an issue is the
amount of the removal of the
uniform licensing act in dealing
with cannabis licensees that's
kind of an issue for small small
businesses and the final point
is
see seeds of Caesar how
important thing for small
farmers and if the license for
staff to apply then that's gonna
be hard for us thank you for
your time appreciate thank you
nexus process and.
Hi I represent that cannabis
women's collaborative.
We are about twenty women owned
small businesses in New Mexico.
We oppose the cabin nursery
license I strongly.
If you referred to.
The federal statue cannabis
containing point three percent
or less of THC is have.
That means that a nursery
license what classified plants
that you can't tell the
difference between have for
cannabis as cat just.
And make an actual license that
would.
Really hard small farmers.
Thanks guys thank you next we
have high loans an L. L. C..
Hello thank you madam chair and
and Representative my name is
Jeffrey because the I own I
don't some hemp farm down in
Silver City New Mexico again I
up I'm total support of this
bill most of the stuff in it the
one thing again like the
previous this upset about the
cannabis nursery license that
that just brings on more rules
and regulations of of that you
know are not being enforced you
know they can't even we can't
even enforce the one that we
have now so why are we creating
more we liked everybody at that
Steven and the previous about
being able to have the seeds and
and and and mature cannabis
plants the second thing I do
bills that you know
That I do pose I mean I do
support is the plant count for
micro businesses are jumping to
a thousand previously an
emergency rule everybody got a
jump except for Michael business
because the way it was provided
I want to see if we could do a
percentage may be instead of of
a a actual number as we're
moving down maybe ten percent
would be the the goal.
Next we have Corey who.
Please try to make your
statement within one minute.
Hi my name's Corey gold.
Use your response in New Mexico
for mom of the girls I eighty
one echo what everybody has said
so far I'm largely in support of
the bill but the nursery
component is on necessary with
the current rags it's income
bring to small businesses and in
looking at cannabis seed
production
one thing that needs to be
considered for regulation is
Colin we don't want the entire
states supply of cannabis flower
to be seated thank you.
Thank you Erica.
Can you hear me.
Yes.
Hi my name is Eric Roland and
the lifetime for farmer gardener
business owner and now currently
licensed cannabis cultivators
this bill three thirteen
confuses national and federal
law with state law seeing
genetic material as with less
than point zero zero three
percent have until it is and for
our with this confusion we're
enforcing the stickman over
regulating quite frankly baby
plants if I Graham a referral
and was here she would be would
be Wilder we have grown plants
in the state as a family for
over seventy years in New Mexico
I'm here to tell you I've never
been more discriminated and
hassled by money municipality by
the plants that I'm growing I am
valid license business of
farming agriculture and is being
unduly restricted my mission
speaks to family and for me what
farming wellness plant
discrimination is fierce and
only through education and
accessibility we make change
towards legitimacy and fairness
just say no to plant
discrimination and allow farmers
to farm responsibly and
sustainably as with any other
crop.
Thank you.
Hey let's go to the audience
again is there opposition to the
bill.
Seeing none back to the webcast
closing comments.
Okay let's see and then ladies
and gentlemen we did lose our
forum.
So.
What we will do is continue to
hear
our presenters for House Bill.
Three thirteen find.
Lows in comments and then will
here three fifteen your
presentation and then the
audience comments okay okay
thank you we also have a moment
I don't want to introduce that
now it's.

Let's go to House Bill three
fifteen present house bill three
fifteen and then we'll go to the
audience for comics.
madam chair house bill three
fifty
Is essentially a promise that
food will you Mexico regarding
the legalization of recreational
cannabis in setting up the
funding mechanisms that allow us
to reinvest only into the
program that is to programs that
we feel to use additional
funding for the substance use
disorder community reinvestment
and those mechanisms that we can
reserves to continue to rebuild
communities that have damaged by
the war on drugs that said madam
chair that sits at the funding
to do that and to ensure that
their that we keep the promises
that we made in setting up this
this industry.
Right to the audience those and
supportive House Bill three
fifteen okay please began my
right
state your support.
Members of your from the
industry.
The state support House Bill
three fifteen this is
similar to the previous bill
common sense way of figuring out
how to start to spend some of
the the revenue of the way that
is going to continue to say
industry.
Some of the harm from.
People.
Our country is it.
Thank you.
Chair of this committee budget
policy alliance we stand is very
strong.
This legislation of most other
states that have legalized
cannabis need directions funds
back into.
To heal the community to support
the community and that's what
this will do the idea that she
reinvest dollars in communities
that are struggling with
substance use that have been
harmed I can't this is really
really important these are.
That
Stefan.
Revenues increased to the state
general fund and so we support
the the funding I just give you
an example in Oregon just last
year they need directed hundreds
of millions of dollars back into
community day substance use
prevention and harm reduction.
And and I think we can do that
thank you madam chair thank you

house bill three fifteen.
About webcast.
We're hearing comments in
support of house bill three

Second.

affected by the firstly is a
good bill so thank you for your
time.
You.
Okay now webcast for comments in
opposition to the bill.

audience so we will call your
bills back to the table when we

We'll have committee discussion
of that time okay.
Coming thank you for the thank
you so much.
Okay let's go to the house joint
resolution twelve.
For K..
Thank you.
Looking at the.
Should be.
Good.
Okay.
I.
Law.
And I texted okay.
Thank you she's close.
Yeah.
thank you Mr.
Okay.
So what are we here bills and
the need for action it is the
offices for the New Mexico this
is not.
I will try and screen number
two.
This is the right type of.
In that case ever in its life so
the wages automatically other.
Usually this is the office of.
You are here.
I am so glad.
We have no one percent people
came to speak we want to
do.
And Brady.
Representative.
To where I am center.
Representative house resolution
is one of the shorter the.
At the center of the with.
Delivered earlier and with this
is the constitution.
And of oil that Representative.
Chair and for the true and
faithful for sticking.
So just have a couple couple
thoughts.
The first is.
You look at the main.
Of those folks who are
registered to vote right now.
So since about two thousand
seventeen the.
Our records during the COVID
Mexico have been independent
selection are.
Fifty four percent
seven.
As you population of folks.
Special orders.
really I want to participate in
this price range.
The and.
The number of people this is the
right now twenty two twenty
three percent right I will
choose who they chose to have
happened so of the.
Should have the option is voting
for all of your choice.
Hello to all the right socks and
friends they said they didn't
realize that registered.
and also when I talk to.
Mentioned you know we just
changed law here to echo that if
you show up to go to the current
in your independent you can go
over the primary.
But you have to change
registration there on the spot
to primary in the state.
That is super offensive.
That is a I chose to be
independent and are saying
that's all I have to on the
status and.
So so that's that's one order.
The others on the check.
This year is right now.
The tax payer's Mexico the for
the primary elections.
Right is the secretary of
state's office it's just
perception General Fund.
And so taxpayer dollars are
going on.
Full independence pre tax
dollars to a so source.
Global slapped rates in your
they're paying taxpayer dollars
in shock about this election.
The.
What will surely.
This this is actually something
I flip flopping on.
I worked for sorry here it's
very much a.
Flow's primary Republicans to
choose who their candidate is
Democrats you choose from there
is.
But also you as I've been here
since last year's I've seen both
parties go like this just keep
going like this.
And and that's because white
houses the people who come to
vote in the primaries.
The.
Not the Representative capital
folks.
Thanks for acting for super
involved
and usually they're the ones out
here.
And so I'm just concerned that
the resources in such great
polarizations one of the reasons
is because the people who select
our candidates.
Our.
The oil was allowed in that
primary election eight of some.
The people in who are paying
taxes.
Your people are registering
their voice made a presenter.
Right supports the bill.
Where is the resolution.
It is really two things.
It says.
What.
The
first pages of the qualified
electors registered to vote
regardless of whether they're
affiliated with a political
party.
regardless of what's on their
voter registration they can join
and open primary elections local
party.
That qualifies as a state
sponsor state for correction.
The first one.
The overall it also won that
primary election.
The.
The second floor of that is the
the second.
On page two of funds but if the
party voted ever wants to rid
himself they can pay for the
election.
Right so so the Republican or
Democrat party decides I don't
want to miss more than they can
pay for the tax system right now
some states do that.
And if you go over this if you
go to NCSL Swetser.
They actually have a nice chart
pharmacies and primary election
types and so I just tell you
they're only eight states right
now our prime.
Forty two over partners to some
extent to this lawsuit for
types.
Just.
The above the **** well that's
true ours is no longer
considered fully closed because
we have same day registration
madam chair to switch for for.
Decline to state voters but I.
Deposit that we're still
working.
The reason of okay and then to
going that we have debated this
issue in in this committee
before
We could probably let it rest
and go to public comment six
there's if there are people who
came to speak right thank you
the audience for us comments in
support of the bill
my right.
My name is Deborah Stein I
recently left the Republican
Party justice I left the
Democratic Party for the very
same reasons that he said that
they're kind of off on their
own.
There are like you said there
are forty two states that allow
for open primaries.
I lived in one of those states
and I saw all the independence
they were allowed to vote and I
think the public can primary or
the Democratic Party the world
allowed to choose it.
But they couldn't both of.
So we should have that choice
thank you thank you K. comments
in support of the bill.
Any further comments okay let's
go to the webcast.
Jim.
Are you taking pro or con at
this point hello.
Of the sorry I'm against away.
Mason were taking funds in
support of the bill.
Yes thank you madam chair
members of the committee makes a
grant comical Mexico we are in
support of this bill we would
welcome any legislation that
would increase voter
participation and I'm more
people the opportunity to have a
say in the party's nominee we
continue to hear from
independence in the class of
state borders advocating formal
primary system we also like the
provision that allows for the
major parties the ability
conduct a close primary by
taking on the financial
responsibility which is our
sensible and doable compromise
so we do at for the past one H.
J. R. twelve thank you.
Thank you Bob growth.
Hey this is Bob corals on
president and founder of New
Mexico open elections we
Representative springing and
open primaries bill.
Forward thank you very much
We believe that.
Opting out on.
I'm very like Colorado has done
is a reasonable compromise
Ortiz one opt out.
That is not a problem or or or
are grieving for most advocates
of open primaries.
One small concern we have is
there are a lots of different
flavors and Representative
Harper mentioned that open
primaries throughout the country
we have nonpartisan
registration in fifteen
different states and under non
partisan registration anybody
can ask for a single ballots
that works well we have
nonpartisan primaries in poor
states that works well we have
fifteen different states
including Colorado that allows
your assets.
Independence of independence
only to choose but the one
provision that could be a
problem in this bill is I.
Yes I'm wrapping
The only concern with this bill
allow me to containerboard for
not have if that were not the
case madam chair members of the
committee when you're awfully
vote a bill we urge support HR
twelve.
Thank you all right well stay on
task do we have any comments in
opposition to the.
H. J. R..
The complications that asked and
then a rounded states have open
primaries in states that don't
think other people who choose to
a party to the replica of the
committee.
To be independent and I think we
open it up it tends to skew what
the Republicans or the Democrats
really staff or what they want I
call myself a Republican cracked
and in still I have to choose in
the primary
with the dynamics of my family
we to school with a vote for it
believe me were very actors
anyway I think it would not be a
good idea to have an open
primary also because for those
reasons thank you for letting me
speak thank you any further
comments from the audience okay
seeing none.
You don't have a quorum so we
can't vote so bring your bill
back up.
So that we can get committee
comments and.
And your bill.
Thank you for being here and to
thank the audience for coming
here today.
Already we are is we're going to
continue with Representative K.
House Bill three for seven with
a presentation of public
comments.
They sent off.
Yes it's crashing.
This is.
Can you provide me say
that Jack's.
So the.
Tax.
This this.
She is.
You're not like.
Thank you you're just listening
to the whether or not
I.
Tell.
Madam you're not judging this
county county hands are.
That sentence and email is yes
or is important.
K. twelve not in opposition he
just wants to make sure yeah.
A second.
Please.
She.
As for.
The case has.
Already representatives.
Please House Bill three four
seven thank you.
Chair and committee irises
sent here to present House Bill
three forty seven with my co
sponsor representative Jason
Parker we also have
Of the.
An expert witness on in as well
I'm here to present this bill in
its relating to up elections
about the signature Marmion.
The canvassing.
we will talk about this much to
the to the previous bill is.
The independent and climbed the
state voter numbers and
percentages are only not just in
our country that is actually in
New Mexico new Mexico's known
for its independent voice
Of both the Representative
Harper and I represent an area
that I know at least my part of
Rio iterations probably thirty
thirty five percent of.
Independence and provide the
state's I I think that is a not
in and
and although we are
firmly representatives of our
party.
Thanks have and that's the who I
ate.
That is why I've chosen my party
I as a representative my
district want to Representative
all of the voters and it is
independence inclined states
need to have a usual playing
field for as equals pop up for
their voice in government this
bill currently our signature
requirements in the state her
kind of I I believe flex more
than they need to be on some
offices don't require signatures
section the commissioners and
the city council mayors others
choir signatures currently our
state Congress and state
representatives state Senate's
require signatures.
So as a Democrat I am required
one and half percent register to
voters in my district voted in
the last governor's.
And and this and that would be a
different number Representative
Harper.
In district.
Because his would be based on
content so I will based.
Just a difference of what is
happening we do statewide
offices the Democrat for
statewide offices governor or
state auditor treasurer.
That would need three thousand
five hundred and eighteen
signatures or Republican needs
one thousand five three
signatures.
With the way it is it is one and
a half percent of all registered
voters who voted in the last
governors if you choose no part.
Superintendents is inclined to
states would require thirteen
thousand nine hundred and twenty
nine seconds.
I
want to change that.
I understand that
That they are able to get their
signatures from one and I was
only get my signatures from
party members.
And so that might make it a
little easier for them but since
the majority of our state are in
rural areas where they can't
service in the parking lot of
the grocery store
on that even when you're driving
to ranch to ranch and farm to
farm
Individuals who work on ranches
and farms are usually not home
seeking a watching either out in
the field they're very difficult
to get a hold of the don't have
the advantages of going to the
county fair and being in the
party's tents which is another
way individuals help get
signatures and I would like them
to be able to have a voice and
be able to have a fair playing
ground when presenting a
candidacy I would like to turn
this over to my co sponsor
Representative Harper and the
for statement as well.
Thank you madam chair and the.
Thank you Mr cover this was
slightly different angle but
still the same page so when I
first ran of eleven years ago
right after redistricting some
my district number actually move
from laws will two very much.
And so the numbers that I had to
get centralized
chain from the calculation of
loss so I to get a hundred
twenty two dollars and
signatures and Rio Rancho which
is not bad regulations would
that process going off and
orders and people's concerns.
And I really believe the
senators are important
As you want there to be folks
were serious that are running
right if you can spend a few
days going door to door talking
to neighbors and signatures you.
You probably can't do what's
required of us here
legislators I do think Senator
court.
Here's why the next election was
recovery software recover ensure
rational.
Added twenty two signatures.
Twenty.
That's been about where it's
been for of yes which is just
weird right so to me this
formula is equation doesn't
quite work right I understand
that they're trying to make it's
on the rural areas of two
thousand signatures.
But there should be some least
minimum thresholds right and so
so that's where I come on to
support this this legislation
right thank you know we probably
don't need these crazy extremes
of twenty two thirteen thousand
right let's just pick some
numbers and just thank you Mr
chair representative medicines
so in this bill just for the
purpose of individuals who are
listening he didn't get a chance
to read the bill it takes away
the formula that the convoluted
complex formula and which we're
currently using we're making
flat signature requirements
based on the office that you see
not on the party or the non
party that you are in so it
thousand signatures for people
seeking state office five
hundred for people seeking of
Congress a hundred signatures
for state Senate seat and fifty
signatures for state
representatives and and I'll
rest for questions thank thank
you let's go to the audience
let's hear all comments in
support of the bill.
About opposition.
Seeing an.
Let's go to.
Webcast.
But I left.
Hello thank you madam chair and
representatives my name is
Stella and I'm the executive
director of New Mexico open
elections and we are fully
supporting this bill as equal
signature requirements help to
level the playing field and
ensure that no candidate has an
unfair advantage based on their
ability to gather signatures
currently in New Mexico state
wide office independent
candidates must collect ten
thousand four hundred and eleven
more signatures than democratic
candidates in twelve thousand
four hundred and twenty six more
signatures than a Republican
candidate.
For congressional office
independent and minor party
candidates must collect
thousands more signatures
compared to major party
candidates and for state
representatives independent and
minor party candidates must
collect hundreds of more
signatures compared to major
party candidates we
empathetically believe that a
fix is needed immediately to
make ballot access fair for all
candidates thank you so much.
Thank you.
All right let's hear from rock.
Thank you madam chair.
I support HB three forty seven
because that would make ballot
access equal the candidates
regardless of party affiliation.
This should encourage
unaffiliated candidates to tap
into the twenty four percent of
unaffiliated voters in New
Mexico.
More candidates and more voters
needs for democracy New Mexico
please give this bill a do pass
thank you madam chair.
Thank you all right well stay on
the webcast that I don't see
more hands for supporting
comments about opposition.
Okay seeing none.
We will have to call you back
and bring the bill back up since
we don't have a quorum I thank

We're here to the city.
Many of you may have realized
last after years of working with
being pretty much constitutional
and.
Lee in the original works
constitution in the context of.
For for for father.
The word so much I am sure that.
The first action on they took.
In the second international
commerce was tired Lester.
To production together to define
words in our constitution so
that.
isn't courts basketball.
That was the intent.
And to that Floyd.
You know.
For the last two years it's been
interesting for me because I've
actually listened to some of our
own legislators saying that yes
we have.
The member for this the it's not
absolute.
In other words yes we have.
The second amendment the words
in the.
Second amendment are absolute.
That concern so.
Each of you are aware that Iran
house memorial the other day on
our nationals Act.
Where we're at and madam chair
on time on the by the time a
professional witnesses done our.
Romo at twenty three million
five point three million
dollars.
So today with respect to that I
bring house doing.
Resolution thirteen Q. which is
the school district convention
of states.
If you read the context of the
opening line of questioning the
Congress of the United mention
on the application for the state
for the purpose of.
Proposing amendments to the
United States conference.
Jushin opposed the school.
On federal government and our
jurisdiction federal government
and to the term of office for
the that's the specifics for.
The.
For the intent of this to a
resolution.
Madam chair and members
our US constitution article I
called for this gives us the
ability to do this when we feel
like we're at the point as as
residents as voting members as
people in the United States that
may or may not have complete
faith in whatever work but we're
going and we may believe and
one.
And then.
One particular action of.
President or government for
Department but at the end of the
day our fiscal cost.
Where we're at.
We can all agree that we all
experience inflation.
Inflation is something that
comes without without decisions
those decisions madam chair come
from what we're doing the
federal level that's the purpose
of this.
Moral with that madam chair and
members alike entered this model
focuses while this is the first
witness in the for I just.
And let him get off the.
Reporter for from to just thank
you thank you very much.
Madam chair members the
committee thank you very much I
know the days long the hour long
moved quickly as we can still
the.
The other standpoint
we're doing my name was called
to.
The state director for the
convention states New Mexico
here before you discuss house
joint resolution thirteen next
application under article I of
the constitution for a
convention of states merrily
limited proposing amendments to
the constitution to impose
fiscal restraints on the federal
government limited power
jurisdiction of the federal
government and the terms of
office for federal officials and
members of Congress.
The operative word.
Is proposed.
Convention of describing call
for an article I was just that
it's a convention economic laws
or regulations you cannot have
some right I meant for it any
other way alter the constitution
of the United States.
Action cannot be the legislative
body.
Why the powers not already
assigned to.
Authorization to propose
possible amendments for the full
fifty states to consider either
Rep I or reject that said.
Once their duties vendors charge
to convention.
But.
This brief we consider the early
stated purposes of this proposed
convention.
There is probably no this
indicator of runway Congress in
this country's financial
condition the national debt
stands at thirty one point five
trillion dollars that is the
Canary in the coal mine.
Signaling the destruction right
I haven't spent.
Of unrestrained legislative and
executive branches on our
families this is directed that
by two thousand thirty.
Less than two election cycles
from now the national debt will
build.
The gross domestic product.
Possibility economic disaster
yet Congress shows no intention
of changing its profligate ways.
We could spend the day listing
unnecessary unreasonable
regulations that position with
no state or local government
review this that stifle
creativity prosperity of New
Mexicos working families and
small.
The same could be said about
unfunded mandates that federal
requirements that burden
counties and local governments
with local eight oversight
consent.
If one example of the
intransigent federal agencies
and difference to local
governments and citizens we can
look to north eastern New
Mexico.
In April of two thousand twenty
two an official state for
servicing nor Walter local
concerns and protests.
Stubbornly adhering to a
controlled burn plan crafted two
years previously with no local
overview.
The HSD set fires and extreme
dry conditions sixty miles an
hour when.
The Four service had the
jurisdiction to do that in our
local authority to stop the
largest fire New Mexico's
history three four one thousand
acres of some of New Mexicos
most beautiful viable force.
Along with homes.
Ranches and farms animals in the
property.
Some of the homes lost.
The state families more than two
hundred years.
New Mexico state is Dorian
stated that the fire quote burns
down and way of life that lasted
this has lasted years New
Mexico.
It was declared a major disaster
which system for the purpose of
matter into a federal
bureaucratic makes.
Government access with fiscal
years directional is
professional life culture of our
federal government is
vulnerability to organized
pressure groups the twenty
twenty poles obtained in three
circles.
Indicates that seventy five
percent of voters in New Mexico
approve congressional terms I
believe so that kids can be
found toward other high level
federal positions as well.
A discussion HB at in the venue
of an article five convention as
to whether term limits for
federal officials might be
appropriate to propose to the
states for ratification.
Or are history twenty eight
minutes of dinner at five one PM
and one PM.
All of it conducted under oath
article five provision for
Congress's submittal of
amendments to the states for
ratification however the frames
of the framers of the
constitution recognized the
possibility of having to bypass
and intransigence self service
Congress I'm willing to learn
excel so they added language
allowing states to come together
in a comp in a convention to
consider proposal members for
ratification or rejection under
the same terms we are at that
point.
Congress has consistently proven
it has no intention of passing
legislation before proposing
amendments that would bring
discipline to the federal
government spending habits.
Limited storage for affected
tenure this members confronting
Federal.
List of federal fiscal right.
Federal over reach in federal
term limits is necessary and
finally the commission of the
state provides the venue.
All the old worn out arguments
against the pressures of the
convention of the state the
retaining discredited and
exposes uninformed just driven
by the political agenda of that
first special interests.
The enemies of article I charge
that no one knows how to
organize the convention or set
up its rules they charged
convention can be corrupted the
nothing stands in way of it's
going out of control.
There funding throwing around
the term cool constitutional
convention four four Konkol.
Even though article five is
clear in our youth what the
framers intended which is a
convention for proposing
amendments detractors like to
suggest that those organizing
and conducting the convention
cannot be trusted the competent
ethical the inner corruption
they would allow the convention
to quote run away another
favorite term for their.
Their entire tech is rendered
moot of one simple fact the
convention is just that a
convention it has no power in on
making proposals.
So where is down the power.
It resides in the state
legislature it's the state
legislature that makes the call
for commission selects the
delegates instructs the bill
recalls the delegates if they're
derelict in their duty then are
two options for the process of
gratification by the state by
state convention for by the
state legislature which indicate
that case the legislature's
would even have the power
ratification or rejection.
The power of the state
legislatures is evident
throughout the process therefore
madam chair members of this
committee with the special
political special interest
pressure futures pressure
groups.
Make their charges they're not
making a claim against the
people involved in the
commission's States movie.
Their attacks not against the
eighteen thousand New Mexico
citizens who've signed a
petition calling for convention
for the five million followers
in two and a half million
petitions cross country they by
their own words according to
figure two.
The members of this committee
that your colleagues on both
sides the out of this building.
And your legislative
counterparts across the nation
they by their own word you're
saying that you lack of
competence to organize and
conduct a convention that you
lack the judgments to seriously
consider the issue and that you
lack of character to do it
right.
We the commission states
movement disagree.
The power given by the
constitution in this case is
exactly where it should be with
the states and their
legislators.
So with member of pressure group
tell you how risky potentially
corrupt a convention will be
they should be expected to
explain why they think so little
of you the legislature's.
And.
The work you do and the trust
placed in you by the people.
I'd like to close with this the
damage being done by profit good
federal spending over reaching
federal positions and
professional life federal
officials affects all New
Mexicans regardless of political
philosophy report New Mexico has
bipartisan choice nineteen
states Fulfer convention and
several others were in play in
two thousand twenty three is my
belief convention will take
place New Mexico.
To go from the ministry of
national leadership and make
sure our state has respected
place at the table a lot of New
Mexico looking for this.
Leadership in the interest and
the protection of our families
and livelihoods thank you very
much for the opportunity to
discuss house joint resolution
thirteen before your committee
thank you we'll go to the
audience of those in support of
the bill off those in opposition
okay I'm gonna start from my
right please make your statement
within one minute please don't
be repetitive don't repeat one
another.
The start.
Thank you madam chair and
committee members planning on
their wall our residents have
every county is really.
Who gets to decide what's best
for us and our families should

matters affect this first no

want the American people to
ponder what will they decide

Thank you madam chair millions
of ordinary tomorrow once that
are relative newcomers to New
Mexico this is our seventeenth
year here and our residents of
San Miguel County.
My largest concern.
With the act.
But we would be addressed by the
commission states would be the
fiscal responsibility I believe
that Washington DC is being
they're responsible fiscally
and I'm concerned that some days
are more sellers who are in
their thirties more of go to the
bank there may be no friends or
maybe no money.
To spend the end of the tragic.
Stratford and stars so roll
side.
So the the greatest idea that I
have is to bring in the fiscal
stress.
It's out of control Washington.
Madam chair representative on
board chair from Santa Fe put
simply I support H. J. R.
thirteen I believe that imposing
fiscal restraints on the federal
government I believe in limiting
the power in jurisdiction of the
federal government and I believe
in limiting the term of office
for it's official for members of
Congress thank you.
Here
Today
Food industry distribution
agriculture manufacturing I do
agree and County.

Saving money what I have here is
what wikipedia.
The.

This is not sustainable it is
destroying our country is

And we change and this needs to
be addressed session today.
Thank you very much.
For the government's Sir.
Thank you of someone who left
for the rest of my life will be
able survival age as groceries
of double in the single year I
just intervention is this
committee to support the
opportunity for schism Senator
us fundamentally misses our
government and constitution to a
call for constitutional
protection of the state.
Governments are responsible for
running causes tremendous
hardships and retired and those
on limited.
We're going to get money is
opposed to a constitutional or
consent of thirty eight states
that was a very high bar in
those such a call does not pose
a research rest of the nation
another important point is that
due to the nature of digital
imparts a very few individuals
putting base us gains are more
at all are in every respect the
twenty first century because of
the twentieth century
Rockefeller Morgan medical terms
for their fortunes the door for
the spending levels of civil
politics maybe forces many years
us as our political system is
predicated on money and media
control of profligate spending
around four by nations and all
the whole time.
For for.
Then.
My name is Claire provided her
non does and I support your
article I constitution states
our federal government has
become a monster totally
understand totally unresponsive
to what we the people want they
are just a training pants the
stop and
I think that we talk about it
and the opportunities available
I do this article I
constitutional like to see New
Mexico.
Approved going to that.
Constitution thank.
Thank you any further comments
what I offer madam chair a
statement either to support or
oppose.
yes thank you to okay addresses
this actual.
For this doctor Robert people
from the department of military
or I'm stranded in Iraq.
I at times wonder if our public
is crumbling and I do see times
the symptoms of all our fellow
Americans mentioned the symptoms
of that concern the people.
I would leave this chamber to at
least consider these.
Because I wonder now why did I
deleted nearly died the city or
the city about Austin
constitution and I would like to
see this body take our power
back as part of this come the
policy.
Okay further comments all right
we'll go to the webcast and
Patrick can you.
Just the names.
Representative stone king.
Grant.
Right here is reserve.
Next person.
Jim does need sober state.
Thank you committee I want to
speak to some of the opposition
arguments of one is that there's
no guidelines or rules for
commission state.
There were thirty commissions
the states up to seventeen
eighty seven and they're always
Commission control by the state
legislatures there's been twelve
since then including the
Colorado River compact Rio
Grande compact over successfully
executed by control the state
legislatures the state the state
constitutions not specific about
how to do well the constitution
does have any specific words
about the writ of habeas corpus
regional jurisdiction or trial
by jury yeah we all know what
that means and they also we knew
what it commissions states was
seventeen eighty seven.
They also say the seventeen
eighty seven was a runaway
convention it's not true the
states as their sovereign folder
representatives major to do what
was needed for the exigencies of
the nation and the states and
ratified the convention.
Thank you.
Mark Meckler go ahead.
Members of the committee on a
bill chair thank you for that
opportunity to be with you today
I travel all over the country as
the president of convention
states actually get to testify
in legislatures all over the
country been watching you all
afternoon and folks like you're
the reason that I have hope for
the country because state
legislatures actually represent
the people the entire idea of
article I was to give people
like you who actually represent
their constituents who live and
work with them the opportunity
to rein in the federal
government when the time came
American people broadly speaking
across party lines believe that
the federal government's
physically out of control but
it's grown too big and the folks
serving Washington DC too long
and you've been given the
opportunity and I would say the
responsibility to weigh in on
behalf of the citizens and to
say enough is enough with
Washington DC and that applies
to both parties so I'm here
today to testify in favour of
this resolution and I hope that
you'll give it a do pass motion.
Bill Culbertson go ahead.
Yes thank you for this
opportunity chairman woman
Johnson my name is bill
Culbertson.
I want to reiterate who is in
charge of this proposed
convention states.
Article five the U. S.
constitution allows for
legislators two thirds of the
several states the call for a
convention for the proposing of
amendments.
H. A. R. thirteen is your
application to call for
convention states for the
purpose of certain amendments
the New Mexico legislature will
be the one who chooses and sense
their commissioners to the
convention New Mexico
legislature will be the one who
directs the actions of its
commissioners which would
include the rules of the
convention the wording of the
proposed amendments and how to
focus on the on the proposed
commitments New Mexico state
legislature will have a key role
in drafting the proposed
amendments that will make
criterion HR thirteen in short
you are the ones in charge not
us we are merely asking you to
exercise your rights under
article I of the constitution we
are just yes in H. R. the thank
you.
Donna at your.
Madam chairman and members I'm a
retired teacher and Silver City
and I support this resolution
because I'm worried about our
country and corruption is such a
huge problem in our federal
government and the citizens of
New Mexico should have a say in
how our money is spent and what
laws are imposed on us and also
most Americans in New Mexicans
support term limits for
politicians article I of the
constitution makes it possible
for New Mexicans to have our
views very thank you.
Monica creative.
Go ahead.
I don't support this bill
because
Just like everyone else has said
you know
But the constitution has slowly.
And Nordby raced and
Not on it anymore not respected.
And it is going to affect our
children our families and.
Thank you.
Mark Fisher.
Thank you madam chairman
Representative so mark Fisher we
have we run a small ranch in
there Bella I'm also county
commissioner here Lincoln County
I am speaking on my behalf and
not the boards
it's obvious to me that might my
constituents everybody I talk to
on any side of the political
spectrum want to feel like they
have a voice they want to be in
control of their lives they want
to be left alone and that's the
term they use we want to be left
alone and so.
By looking at this article five
convention of states in reducing
the power scope of the federal
government they can be left
alone more and be brief we can
be more responsive to them as
local and state representatives
for those those folks that we
have for branches of government
believe it or not the fourth
branch is the administrative
state and it is killing us they
passed laws rules and
regulations that have the effect
of loss and print criminal
penalties so again for our look
at this thank you very much for
the your.
Mary M..
Hello this is actually Stuart
Ingle
Thank you for let me address
this chair and committee I think
we need to look no further than
the imminent collapse of our
currency and our our
Our banking system to recognize
that no restraints bending we'll
have a catastrophic effect on
every
constituent every every citizen
in our society and without some
restraint on the federal
government we are heading off a
cliff so I would urge you to do
pass on this bill so we can this
is a constitutional amendment so
that we can be a participant in
that process thank you very
much.
Thank you Bill Jordan.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee of Bill Jordan
with New Mexico voices for
children and we stand strongly
opposed to this resolution you
may remember that for a couple
of decades actually New Mexico
had a resolution on the books
calling for a constitutional
convention and we repealed that.
Four years ago because it was
such a bad idea
I want to make two quick
comments one is that I think
this is simply another end
around attempt to try to cut
funding for things like social
security Medicare Medicaid
education and the second comment
is that you'll does this in the
FIR that you have in front of
you that wants a constitutional
convention this call anything
can be done with such a divided
country right now this is not a
time for us to be re writing our
constitution we have too many
rights at stake thank you for.
When the pain.
Yes.
My name is Wendy Payne eleven
Neil creek New Mexico and I
support fully this.
House resolution and I ask that
you.
Madam chairman and members of
the committee to.
Seriously consider passing it
and moving to the convention of
states thank you.
Thank you in the.
Robin Lloyd Miller.
Hello thank you all for letting
me have a chance to speak I am a
military spouse thirty five plus
years.
I am very upset about watching
our rights being slowly taken
away from us watching my
paycheck my social security
check go down the drain for high
cost of food and living.
I totally support the convention
of states as a way to have our
voices heard.
And.
I had several family members
lose their life in World War
two.
And several wounded in other
combat other conflicts.
Trying to protect our rights in
our constitution I don't think
the constitution is a little
piece of paper that needs to be
ignored it's vibrant and I
didn't know about this part of
the constitution so I'm glad
somebody's out there.
To help us stand up for our
rights that are slowly one by
one being taken away from us
thank you revenue.
Carlos object.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee of Carla Suntech
with better together New Mexico
you've heard a lot of testimony
today about all the reasons why
people want this to occur I
would like to address something
that you heard earlier and
rumors that go around rampant
that if you do this there can be
a runaway convention I had the
opportunity to observe how this
worked.
And nothing could be further
from the truth they are people
just like you as a matter of
fact if you approve this and
this goes forward you could be a
delegate to that convention
those people hold each other
accountable for what is on the
agenda to be considered and
nothing else is considered it's
fascinating to see how it works
and we don't need to live in
fear I would encourage you to
listen to all your constituents
that really want this to happen
and vote yes on house joint
resolution thirteen thank you.
Thank you Carl.
Now I only check.
Go ahead and I am a.
L. okay.
Meet yourself.
Right now we're gonna move on
okay.
Representative we're gonna give
you one more chance.
Thank you like to speak.
All right sorry I cannot hear
you we're going to move on.
That's a.
Already thank you do we have any
let's say on the webcast for
opposition.
Opposing comments.
This.
Robert gable.
Yes hi I was the here here for a
okay.
One of the convention of states
I just wanted to let you know
that I I would I volunteer as a
district captioning convention
of states district fifty three
and we've got well over two
hundred people that are in
support of it the young
government many constituents
that are for and I want to thank
you madam chair and
representative for giving us
this opportunity to share and
again this is a convention of
states is not a constitutional
convention the only real
constitutional convention that
took place was in seventeen
eighty seven and that's when we
we had our great constitution
and we've got wisdom from our
past from our founders from
everything and I I encourage you
please the spot would neglect
the wisdom that we have from the
past and in just a we ask that
you would support this.
Invention of state.
Thank you.
Mason Graham.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee thank you Graham
kamikaze Mexico we are in strong
opposition of this bill hearing
a comments from the support you
know there are some things that
were brought up in regards to a
runaway convention which is in
fact a lot we possibility also
the extension of the original
scope that was intended in the
convention I believe this bill
is addressing fiscal restraint
and time limits but once the
commission again there is the
possibility of me going beyond
that also our political planning
today is very different from
what was in the previous
connection so today we have
politicians the state level in
the federal level and we're
supporting those who are are
backed by special interest
groups there can be some really
thankfully harmful consequences
as well such as limiting the
federal government's ability
provide social services like
this actually by mental
protection public health
initiatives those all have
really particularly harmful
effects in New Mexico so we do
actually do not pass on this and
if any of the members of the
committee to have questions
about this no we do happy to
share in your information we
have thank you basically.
Dennis.
Go ahead Dennis.
Okay got your.
Just I I hi my name is Dennis
Denton I represent the
convention of states and I got
really not more of anything to
say that was hard have already
been said and I I thought we
hear more of that position today
but I just want to say the
opposition is based mostly on
fear half truths and status quo
and we at the convention of
states through this process
Representative self governance
and solutions based on returning
power to the people of the
states I've been involved with
convention of states for nearly
ten years now I've heard the
objections over and over again
there is no change they do not
have any solutions and if we
don't do this we are at a
turning point in our country and
I hope that you will please
please give us the opportunity
to move forward on this thank
you madam chairman
Representative.
Thank you Dennis.
Sure yes.
We are done alright this.
Representative.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you Representative and expert
witness.
So you know I'm first of all we
are is in testimony from special
interest groups they're scared
of other groups that would be
involved.
I would just make that point
first of all the.
Second of all chair
representative
what safeguards are in this to
sure that we don't have a
runaway convention Madam.
Madam chair representative
walked language itself state
Gorsuch thing
we've we've said.
The the language called for
convention for proposing
amendments has nothing to do
with the power of affecting the
convention Lexus novel provided
proof that it is a convention
has no power.
It is authorized proposed yes as
the first if we want to.
If we will be taking example of
a PO the state a rogue members
that are.
Some
something stupid like.
Moving.
The national capital to to be
consensus if you will the reason
I use that is that the special
interests were talking years ago
that was one of the fear tactics
that they used to scare people
that they've actually the
capital thank so they would just
take that.
Consider for numbers.
Before numbers money.
Thirty four.
Twenty six.
Thirty eight.
Thirteen.
It takes at least thirty four
states two thirds of the state
to be able to.
Have the commission called.
Thirty four states with the same
content.
That's a pretty high bar and
that that means that that the
language that to be discussed
is.
This is our.
Twenty six.
Convention is one state one
vote.
There's two the twenty six votes
could kill any kind of a the
ministers the roll.
Thirty eight.
Thirty eight is three fourths of
the states in the union it takes
that many to to actually ratify.
Amendment and so a rogue
amendment just got these bars
the crops.
And probably as importers as any
is that the number thirteen.
Third it all it only takes
thirteen states to kill of the
proposed.
So one actually got through all
of this.
Which they can.
The only thirteen state needs to
move that what that means is a
Romans off runaway conventions
and pops.
And and those are fear tactics
there were.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative so I guess.
My concerns.
Stem from something being out of
touch passing through this
convention of states such as
taking away Medicare or social
security we heard that today.
What safeguards are in place to
make sure that doesn't happen
madam chair they just simply do
not have the power to even
address that there the the
there's no power for that
there's no authorization for
that so we convention and so
these are these are tactics is
been years for.
You know for years and the the
arguments don't change I saw the
COVID callers organizations to
convention.
And there.
Exactly.
What I saw in in
This the exactly what I saw in
in in the.
The.
Conversations are being had four
years ago.
They have changed and they've
that they're no more right now
than you were then yeah that
there are safeguards this their
guard over there there's no
safeguards worry about because
the commission has no authority.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative substances under
article I.
I would assume that the Supreme
Court.
Could intervene potentially is
that correct Madam chair
representative.
Madam chair representative
One of the.
Continue to answer from this
point forward all start.
Thank you thank you for that.
The question again thank you
madam chair representative so
the Supreme Court what role they
played if you needed to hold us
accountable if you Mr said it
can't happen but let's just say
you know one of the millions
happen Madam chair
representative block the courts
have ruled plate if.
It's some kind of illegal action
has been is this is taking place
if there's a suit against.
You know a program meant for
example if you have a roll
commissioners that put together
a rogue amendment.
and it's outside the boundaries
of the stated purpose of the
convention then you've got a
you've got an action it's
actually believe that point that
point the Supreme Court would be
could be if it made it all the
way up could be put in a
position of call in the that are
not valid the important thing
there is.
Even if this even the fate out
of control Supreme Court.
Gold rose then balance is still
has to.
Is still has the right I so
they're still not a you know
still not there the porch of
their.
To litigate.
Up to to separate these things
as they would be anything any
any time and so there's no the
thank the point is the course of
run convention they may sit back
and make a decision this brought
to about limit yourself the.
Okay thank you madam chair thank
you Representative so.
You know under the constitution
what guidelines are in place for
the convention you know who
who's the one that is the chair
of the convention and then
however the delegates elected
from states madam chair
representative.
want to get off the firm of what
the better chair of the block I
think the concerns come from up.
From the concern that some
people have that we don't know
how to do a convention.
We don't have big leadership
with rules with the but this is
a.
A convention there's there's a
few things were embedded in the
American life over our history
in terms of our relationships
each other than conventions the
Interstate conventions of
political conventions State you
know the goes on and on is that
the the tradition.
Of being able to organize
convention.
It's it's it's almost natural in
it so so who does it that the
The constitution does not lay
out those guidelines because the
constitution like it's that long
ago lays out no guidelines for
in the constitution is not a.
Operations manual it's it's a
constitution that protects
certain aspects of the so anyway
point being.
The.
A constitution is organized by
the people the legislature's of
designated to do it this happens
all the time and
hundred years ago here in Santa
Fe.
There was Interstate Commerce
convention that actually
occurred here said the product
was.
The Colorado New Mexico water.
That happened.
Nineteen twenty one right here
in the state.
It's a that is.
They did it and then when and
they were able to do it and
because of that New Mexico was
assured their physicians in the
water supply that federal
states.
In like manner I think what
we're looking at here is that we
have an opportunity here to make
some assurances to future
generations that there will be a
country that is not gone
bankrupt.
And so anyway long long after
the short question conventions
are in our DNA it we we all know
how to.
Conduct convention thank you
madam chair thank representative
and I would agree with you on
that No Way the democratic and
the Republican convention every
four years for president and we
pick somebody and you know I
don't think anyone has died.
At least in a fist fight or
something at the event and so I
would I would estimate yes as
Americans we're very good at our
civic duty to do that so could
you just elaborate a little more
about that local.
what was at the Rio Grande
compact in the Colorado River
compact chair representative.
No what was the result of that
and.
However the parties affected by
that manager.
Madam chair and work for the.
S. must ensure first follow.
Chair representative law I don't
know a lot of the details about
the specific details about the
compact that was produced as a
as a result what it did was set
the rules of engagement if you
will between the state of New
Mexico state Colorado on their
water supplies obviously the Rio
Grande and and others up it set
into it it's set into motion the
ability to code I.
The protection of water for for
both states that's what that is
what the commission was about.
Thank you senator from the Tampa
and we have the right people.
At that time.
But the caller and.
Texas we would be an issue that
we have right now best walks
thank you thank you madam chair
thank you Representative so
going I I did ask the question
how do we pay delegates.
So if the delegates for New
Mexico let's just say we passed
this who we sent to this
convention Madam chair
representative.
Madam chair representative my
understanding is.
The body determines who that
representative of this.
Thank you Representative so you
know I I notice requires thirty
four states so we would have
representation both democratic
and Republican state and there
would be some crazy partisan
gridlock with whoever we sent so
if we passed this we send
somebody.
In the current make up of our
legislature it would likely be
the democratic individual who
represents our state is that
correct madam chair Madam chair
representative in the current
I was probably most likely
the end of the day look at from
a bigger scale.
Respect fifty states
nineteen states of our sign on
to this other states are are
moving in the same direction
when we look at it from.
Red and blue perspective.
One of the reasons why this is
so bored right now.
Mexico.
Is to be able to make sure that
we have that for support
the thirty four states.
With respect to this is the the
issue.
Just making sure the Sicko I
have to disable.
Thank you madam chair click for.
The commissioner of the share to
add to that.
Leadership there are their
intentions there is you know we
we we we have a room full of
leaders here there are
intangibles.
To leadership.
Up.
The way the the the the way
that.
Will our trusted are selected or
or or look to for leadership
even among leaders of.
And.
Leisure take initiatives and do
things I stepped out to do the
things because the rest of us to
to to to them
That's kind of the case here
with I believe the state New
Mexico with all with all respect
to both parties we know that
this is a blue state and and if
looks that will be.
But the New Mexico needs to be
seen as a leader in this
movement say they need to take a
position that.
Close the subtleties the
intangibles of leadership when
the convention has to go leisure
you got followers.
The leaders will be look to the
more so than followers there's a
reason in the world.
Why the blue states should not
be sitting at a respected place
to table when this happens and
that's that brief is the the
upshot of this whole thing is
that this is not a.
Republican thing is not a
Democrat thank but of the the
democratically influence states
need to have their input it's a
gonna have their input they need
to be seen as leaders at.
Thank you madam chair
representative I appreciate that
answer and so I usually like the
devil's advocate as you probably
can tell so my question is
regarding why New Mexico use
have this and doesn't anymore I
believe the testimony said that
we used to have a convention of
states provision in our
constitution wasn't revoked or
something Madam chair for.
Commission of sure okay thank
you madam chair Representative
locked up.
A few years ago.
The house actually passed a
resolution calling from
conventions States it was in
committee in the Senate when
the.
with the session adjourned.
And so the resolution stood on
the house side.
And a year ago or two years ago
of the leave the house rescinded
all existing resolutions
including that so that was the
issue that it actually passed
the house
and all all resolutions for
CENIC two years ago thank you
madam chair thank you
Representative so yeah it would
be misinformation to say that we
adopted a ready and the voters
already voted on.
It would be a yeah correct to
say that was just house the past
thank you madam chair thank you
Representative and I want to
make sure that we reaffirm that
point that the voters still have
to vote on this after passes our
house and our Senate so after
that it would go on the lections
that correct Madam chair
representative you madam chair.
The on the twenty twenty four
dollars if this is the kind of
our chapter by the.
The yes if I could add to that
from the way this works is to
with with the Legislature calls
when they make the application
the application that the
legislature has.
The legislature's basically
another job that time and the
the resolution is transmitted to
Congress Congress is required
once served thirty four states
and the thirty four states
Congress is required to place to
make a place the time for the
convention and Congress steps up
but what happens is there are
two ways that you could select.
For your for your of your fear
delegate street commissioners
one with the by election.
For one would be legislative
action consul.
But once once it's past this.
Was this past this legislative
body then that cold goes to
legislature to the callers
but then that makes it very
important point here's
conversational ruled other than
that there rules Mr if there are
they are expected their order to
make the call for the convention
name the place that time and
then they're out.
Great thank you madam chair
thank you Representative.

forward and no further questions

Thank you Representative.
You madam chair thank you in
writing to the taken the time to
come this afternoon speak to the
representative has expert
witness that was excellent
detailed information my vote is
based on the piece of
legislation only.
I don't think he's done that I
would remind you that both table
and considered but the parts for
me that need to be looked at
again are the three items listed
on page.
They're very polite very.
Exactly what.
Takes a different he's.
The.
We working on.
And if we as a state legislature
are called to select people and
instructed them at this
convention.
We have to be really clear and
will pass instructed them to
fight for we're struggling to do
and this is not for me specific
and not for us to get them clear
instructions and and we would be
accountable for those
instructions and I'm not clear
on what the people who've been
talking to me and even his
pocket today.
Which piece is.
What they're really after.
What they don't want.
Of the one it is clear access is
limited to office for federal
officials and members of
Congress we can send them with
that instruction the other two
are to pay and I think we need
to consider limiting the terms
of office here if we're gonna
gonna do that too I say let's
start here and set them on.
