Kerrey served on the Senate
floor about speaking from so
that may not make it up right
now but replace all the this
paper will see how it all righty
I'm four ten minutes for each
presentations
If.
You may begin Sir.
Good afternoon my name is for
special and general counsel for.
New Mexico department and I'll
be working.
language.
Bill related to the insurance.
I think it's important to.
Number why this bill is here in
the first place issues come up.
Didn't happen yesterday or last
year Senator.
built before this to start thank
you.
Maybe call.
With the federal government.
S. law offices need to fund and
develop.
Repository.
Your waist.
Senator years now.
And here we are we still don't
have that who.
Ground deposit Tory.
So that's why you have a
proposal by.
The company that's madam chair.
I have a question.
Yeah in person are you filming
this are recorded.
Madam yeah would you please sure
it's disturbing I think you
have.
And if we could finally see.
Sorry about that but as.
Should have been done okay.
This is a.
Topic of interest folks yes.
So thirty years later we'll
still have that correct
repository.
The New Mexico meantime pence
taken on with project and we are
taking their waste.
Questions for underground.
So.
But what we have here is for
proposals to do above ground
storage with still no sign
repository is going to happen.
So we just.
Past history.
That that we school.
Stay here.
So that's sort of the genesis of
this bill.
There's also been a failure over
the past four years and our
governor.
to the department of energy.
Regulatory Commission four years
ago twenty nineteen sep please
come talk to us we have issues
of concern about this proposal.
What was the response sites.
She wrote again to the previous
president twenty twenty making
the same request please go
consult with we have issues.
In our city please come talk to
us.
What was the response sites.
The twenty twenty one.
Dale G. R. C. during your
process for this particular
license application.
So we have concerns.
You're gonna be putting
something for this accident our
local communities around there
do not have the training to be
able to deal with the accident.
You're not providing training
and some that's one of the cost
for us.
What was the response by inner
city and delete.
Such.
Then again last fall.
President I came to New Mexico.
She gave them a letter and asked
you would you please help this
process and talk to us.
You should be called consulting
with us as a state.
We move ahead with this.
So far the response hasn't come
back yet.
But it's been discontinued
pattern of ignoring our
requests.
To come and talk to us.
It consent based process.
This resulted in this
legislation.
Because what other avenues open
to us state.
The state statute that says.
You may not.
Get permits from us within our
authority.
Nothing to do with radiation or
anything like that it was like
groundwater the NRC has no
experience no ability to do
she's the state area.
Surface water discharge permits.
Those are things the state
issues Garcia has nothing to do
with those so it's not
interfering with their
authority.
We we raise those again and
again.
In this bill and save state sees
the federal government comes and
consults with this issue those
permits.
So I don't think there's really
a are approved the.
Washington DC lawyer out for
here and
he was trying to argue about
this is a preemption she has
nothing to do production.
The Supreme Court said you
cannot for states issue permits
within their authority for
nuclear facilities.
And that's what this bill which
is doing is consistent with
that.
The state would not issue
permits for areas with our state
authority till.
Contador in place and you go
consult with us.
So I think that's
it's a pretty straightforward
build.
Even Senator surprises.
Senator sideboards moved
considerably poll efforts
towards on boarding the
preemption preemption issue.
So I think that's that those
remarks I'd like to say.
Presentation of course this year
other questions that we have to
do.
Okay thank you Sir.
Hello ready next press present
please.
Okay.
For the.
Madam chair members of the
committee thank you for the
opportunity to speak to you
today about Senate bill fifty
three when is it more on the
program director for high school
because the proposed facility we
County New Mexico.
When you read Senator fifty
three words safety is not use
that's an attentive I customer
appreciation.
Outside committee rooms Senate
bill fifty three so the perfect
Mexico against unsafe project
and safe transportation.
That statement is categorically
unfounded based on hyper.
Considering my limited time I'd
like to cover the safety of
transportation of spent nuclear
fuel that'll be my focus is
regulated by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission and the
department transportation.
Our nation has been shipping
specifically or fuel for
commercial and government
reactors for over sixty years
there's been over one thousand
three hundred shipments of
commercial for over eight
hundred fifty shipments of
government fuel all of the next
few safely with no release of
radioactive material.
Shipments of spent nuclear fuel
use type the canisters for
robust design.
Physical testing of these
canisters show that they can be
dropped thirty feet.
Dropped again from four feet on
a spike Byrd for thirty minutes
for fourteen hundred degrees and
then submerged in water and they
will not breach there will not
be able to see.
The R. C. is also assumes cast
caring C. will the casters can
withstand collisions with an
unyielding object from a hundred
twenty miles an hour.
As well as being burned for
three hours about thirty
thousand gallons patrol.
And they will for each.
It's hard to overstate the
robustness of these containers
and highly regulated process
that must be here to ship.
You may hear the NRC stated that
there will be thirteen accidents
up ten thousand.
And that each accident with.
to their selectivity on the
phone over there are I suggest
this young man be removed from
the room.
Well I was not madam chair we
need.
And madam chair that's the
second time.
You're gonna have to leave leave
the room.
I feel that I'm community
program want to be here madam
chair.
There was a warning and still.
Because.
I will have a quarter years.
We can't if my committee members
are not comfortable tools
outcomes.
Madam chair.
Yes we have a rule that it has
to be approved first these
meetings are recorded in our
archives so you can get the
recording what will thank you I
was not reported just now I have
a phone in my eyes to many
people in this room right here
to Sir madam chair that tears a.
I'm not I'm not leaving.
Actually
have that every person with a
vote in the house through.
Just really hear the content
what if we just all.
Please put your phone down which
is closed down it is the
presentation we have to gavel in
at thirty.
Okay
thank you you hear that the
university stated there would be
thirteen accidents out of ten
thousand that each accident
released radioactive material
that statement is categorically
wall.
This to the official in our
State statement out of context
and we did the unsubstantiated
at the fact is the focus on
safety risk mitigation policies
and procedures there's a
probability one in ten.
The severe real accident would
occur during the operational
life facility think about that
one thing truly.
And it's unlikely event the
severe accident with her if that
one in ten trump Kerr there will
be a release.
Not.
These are facts substantiated
through yes the valuation but in
our State with the.
Our opponents are quick to relax
you know hi to transportation of
spent nuclear fuel understand
the spent nuclear transport in
unit trains containing only the
fuel nothing else no other
material to be transported with
spent nuclear fuel their weekly
right trains moving nuclear
material.
These trends up right away.
And all of the treatments will
clear rates before fuel that's
part of policy.
It's also been stated that
shipments would transit through
San Fran offer.
The fact that is not true the
fact is the shipments will not
transmit stated although the
movie will be safe and secure
nonetheless madam chair members
of the committee in closing
for our nation continues to show
traditions safety transportation
that the crew.
Conferees categorically false
second Senate bill fifty three
is preempted by federal law.
And third social justice was
assessed by the NRC and
documented to the final part of
impacts in New Mexico
Environment Department was
equity agency one of final EIS
they took part in that statement
for these reasons Holtec does
not support Senate bill fifty
three we request your vote
against it thank you very much
thank you.
Thank you madam chairman my name
is John Heaton and I am the vice
chairman of the any of the
Energy Alliance interim any Li
Energy Alliance is made up of
the cities of Carlsbad and Hobbs
and Eddy and Lea County we came
together for economic
development purposes there was a
project put forth by the we that
we thought as a combined effort
we would have more horsepower if
you will and so with that that a
group has been together ever
since and that project that we
were anticipate was abandoned by
the E. and we were going back
for a couple of years and then
it became pretty apparent that
the bill revenue commission on
America's nuclear future would
put forth Senator presentations
several proposals of which.
consolidated storage was one of
those proposals and after seeing
that a twenty twelve when the
report was released we believe
that the site we at with the
thousand acres was perfect for
this project it was
The site that we thought.
Very very well okay it's stable
there's no ESA issues and there
are no water issues associated
with the side we have a very
strong nuclear I. Q. and
southeastern New Mexico because
of what project that realized
that the board needed to that
this project significantly so
the board matrix two nuclear
power plants to look at the
various types of storage to make
sure that we were looking for
the best and the safest and we
also then went to manufacturing
facilities to see out of the
various components were being
constructed and so we look at
the.
Canisters that hold spent fuel
we love to ask.
Manufacturing and and the
robustness of them and then we
had a meeting with the NRC
itself I understand the process
that we would be going through
and they made it very clear to
us how rigorous their whole
process is and that in spite of
their needs sixty five of these
licensed in the United States
they would still have to go
through all the geo technical
issues related to the project
and it would take several years
to do that so we after
recognizing that there were
sixty five facilities we came
back with a significant amount
of confidence in the safety of
this project we live there are
families of their children live
there and we certainly didn't
want to bring anything to the
areas of the building.
To anybody's health or safety so
we we continued to entertain.
Opportunities in the world that
do.
Do this kind of manufacturing
and and have storage facilities
and and we listen to their
proposals and then ultimately we
sent out in our the cause of our
well as I group and whole text
was the clear winner of that R.
F. P. and we engaged that.
Let me say a couple words of
battletech they are an
extraordinary company they hold
more than a hundred and sixty
Pattons yeah I would call them a
research company that applies
their patents to the
manufacturing or their scruples
are impeccable not once at eight
not delivered and anything they
told us for drugs we have a very
high degree of confidence in
them I can't say enough about
their work Justice ethics and
commitment to excellence hold
back is in the process of
licensing a hundred sixty
megawatt small operating under
reactors perfecting yes are to
provide heat to replace coal and
at generation generating
stations a solar collector
technology to co locate with the
S. M. R. and high heat capacity
green boiler.
This is the type of innovative
manufacturing.
We should make every effort to
bring to New Mexico.
The temporary of storage
facility is a great project for
us in southeast New Mexico with
the ups and downs of the oil and
gas industry and with the ups
and downs of the potash industry
this helps us stabilize our
economy we're expecting five
hundred fifty jobs and it
average at an average of about
seventy six thousand per
employee and two to three
million dollars capital
expenditure in I companies and
bringing and innovative company
that would continue to help us
with growth in southeast New
Mexico and in New Mexico at
large you all know that rural
areas of the state struggle
terribly to bring economic
development and jobs to their
people this legislature talks
endlessly about diversifying the
state's economy but when we
attempt to diversify motions
state drive decisions rather
than fact based evaluations we
have a letter of support signed
by Eddy and Lea counties and the
cities Carlsbad hops by the all
right to Fishel's we have state
of the art environmental
monitoring center in Carlsbad
and.
It's run by New Mexico state
engineering department and your
time is.

You know we're gonna have
president right now.
We have a motion to.
This.
Committees of for discussion
purposes.
Second no opposition with your
committee substitute thank you
madam chair committee members so
all first described the two
things this bill goes all
described the three minor
changes to the substance to make
you rich.
So
Twenty twenty two chair members
we passed as per the prime
package increase in the budget
to the survivors of first
responders whose.
Provides the ultimate sacrifice
in the line of duty two one
million dollars we really should
have also includes.
That changed.
And so the first was billed as
it changes.
For some.
Firefighters and additional
this from the current fifty
thousand to one so that we match
our first responders that that.
The second thing it does is it
puts this into a contract which
should have.
Chair in the numbers and all
talk about that as part of the
order.
so
three things to go ahead with
first twenty twenty two
We were twenty fifth.
Sure the earliest the government
could have signed that
legislation.
It should.
Thanks for reading very.
Intends.
Just going to affect with the
governor's for twenty twenty
twenty.
We're provided with patch you
can consult.
The second piece of this was
found here for an hour and the
committee recommended
maintenance changes great
change.
We added a new section three.
And this corresponds to
distributions to fire
protection.
Right now all of your the
automatic distribution if the
funds.
To a fifty thousand dollars the
of our state really to make sure
that if ever.
This tragedy there's enough
money to make that payment
recommended that we raised two
million dollars.
Eight we did we added that
sessions madam chair field on
page.
For a change on page five.
Change that to the distribution
of one million dollars.
Committees of the.
In the title thank you madam the
state forty five and we have one
is set up to three.
Madam do you have the let's
check.
That.
Two two five four four five
point here.
Thank you.
I think.
Thank you.
Chair of.
The last thing I did was last
committee for one of the a
student members noticed that in
the title the reference
surviving spouse and children
but the statute it also
references currencies and so we
added and parents can.
So those are the those with
changes questions.
Most finish by saying Madam.
My son Stephen has been.
Yes Representative Daniel beers
for for a long time they
actually look like twins fused.
In.
That is on the.
In the it's hard reduces family.
And we all passed legislation so
that.
To receive help.
And the effective date was not
with the legislature intended.
By making this change those
families will receive help this
legislature cut off of
turnovers.
My my friend.
Thank you madam chair by Tyrion
Committee I'm honored to get to
sign on to this bill has a past
fire chief and.
Thankfully I never had to go
through losing you know a member
of my department.
But Mr do all up again the other
day when we honored with ten
eighteen and
Four and every time they bring
up those bagpipes it's just a
constant reminder that these
people get up.
And they go to work and their
families depend on they think
they're coming home sometimes
they don't make it all.
And as I was looking at the Weis
child of lieutenant king.
What goes through my mind is
their whole life whole to
trajectory of their lives
changed and I think the least
that we can do is just take some
burden off of oil and give them
the benefits that they deserve
for fire and police so with that
question.
Representative all right let's
go to the audience we'll go to
the audience who is in support
of this bill please raise your
hand.
In opposition.
Right seeing them please thank
you miss Camilla I normally I
stand before you on
environmental issues however the
coach of my son's soccer team
was on.
Through.
He was not on the helicopter
these other very his team in
there Sen I just as the
individual loosely impact
situations like.
Thank you let's go to the
webcast.
John with you.
Thank you madam chair members
the committee John Lipschutz
with The New Mexico federation
of labor AFL-CIO we strong
support of this measure and and
thank the sponsors for bringing
it up we also are supporting a
similar measure in the Senate
Senate bill two fifty operate up
by Representative senator Byrd
by you know again this is
something where we stand in
strong solidarity with our first
responders are firefighters or
paramedics they put their lives
on the line for all of us and I
think the least we could do is
is if they do make that ultimate
sacrifice for us that we make
sure that their families are
taken care of so for those
reasons we very much urge you to
support this measure thank you
thank you next we'll hear from
Davis Alessia.
Hello.
yes I so I'm actually here for
the full to ban bill but I I
would say also support this bill
yes.
All righty let's go to committee

percent in fact in two separate
Representative Chasey.

Gravy next we have the old one
three regions yes mention let me

Senate Bill.
Saturday.
It is.
This
is just a Senate version
Representative.
Because we have a lot.
This is small.
You're not possible.
That was.
Okay.
Okay.
Register for vehicles.
You may begin.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee
Representative Hernandez and I'm
here to present Senate bill one
thirty three it is a very
straightforward bill all it does
is it makes it more difficult to
sell catalytic converters that
had been removed from the
vehicle hello that the that's
the catalytic converter
really skyrocketed a nationwide
in our state in recent years and
this bill will help alleviate.
some of that because of the
family members are still
unofficial on their turn right
around and sold Stan secondhand
for the valuable rentals and
there may have to just as I'm
sure that you have to prove
ownership of the vehicle in
order to self park and with that
we stand for questions behind
our expert witness is not to be
found.
And representative before you
continue presentation we have a
fund factsheet do have a fund
that so one of the reasons why I
was really excited to sign on to
this bill I'm not usually a
super fan of crime bills but
this woman a lot to me my father
actually worked for GM in the
seventies and he was on the team
of like original nerds that is.
So I take it a little bit
personally every.
That.
Because the problem.
The problems.
That is okay the needs of the
services I was.
No not the wrong one thirty
three.
You should have.
There was a man the last
committee yes it is two two zero
seven committees of it was yeah
this case of the of the last and
lasts and lasts more.
We have a couple.
The amendment.
Bill got then and
both committees and for.
Are we ready to go to the
audience.
The.
Laura are you okay.
All right let's go to the
audience okay do we have the
audience who are in support of
the bill.
Please.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee to both of the
Sanchez and Camilla I only with
the Sierra Club and we stand in
support of this bill you may
know that there is a greater
instance.
so and how to hybrid car energy
because the hybrids even more.
Sessions.
There's actually.
That that takes quite awhile to
get that catalytic converters
and that in some people in that
rental cars for weeks on and.
I just thank you for any
support.
Right thank you Sir.
Thank you madam chair committee
members I stopped listening
culture on funding we're this
problem because I I two previous
are will yield and we have the
catalytic converter stolen out
of both the
we have to replace the entire
muffler in each of the so
anything that you could do to
make it more difficult for
people to so we'll have the same
catalytic converters would be
greatly appreciated thank you
thank you further comments in
support of the bill we have a
couple okay Mrs letterman with
their of their sitting right
there two minutes please Jason
Weaks and I can tell the doctor.
And it's got scammed.
Yeah.
Yes.
The New Jersey committees
registered lobbyists for the
Mexico auto dealers association
and for the responsible in the
recyclers New Mexico stands for
this legislation some changes
were made in the Senate that
that make it much more viable in
it also lines with the other
provisions in the recycle metal
pack really you think this is
good target catalytic converters
industry involved in a
meaningful way they can actually
be an entity that helps
discourage
the stealing and then legal sale
of catalytic converters and then
also offers a track folks down
ring gauge in that enterprise
meaning if we get all of their
personal information when
they're trying to make it a
legal transaction we can then
relate police officers this is
good too because it allows now
not just the state the gauge of
the regulatory effort against
This Is bring local governments
into the mix so that they can
actually
but local resources towards
both.
Deterring and punishing folks
who actually traded addition
this of those reasons is in
for thank you thank you.
Yeah stand when.
Scott Scanlon registered
lobbyists for enterprise rent a
car need to stand in support of
this bill just in the last three
months we had about a hundred
thousand dollars damages to to
our harsh these folks are really
good they're very fast so not
only do we suffer damage to the
car with the.
Which the the the the loss of
revenue and inconvenience to our
customers and all that so this
is a very bill Ritter support
thank thank you.
Can you ask if there's any
Morris comments in support or
opposition on.
All.
Okay any okay was given to the.
I have.
Mr Valencia we are doing public
comment in support of House
Bills and sorry Senate failed
one of the hello.
Okay so earlier this year my
dad's the truck actually got
stolen they got the cats and
thankfully his work is nearby
because if not of been really
hard for him says this thing is
his job so thank god for that
right and say I'm supporting
this bill because I would just
primary and the overall to the
bills.
Thank you.
And actually the mechanic so he
got it he actually guys catch on
pretty fast is the so thank god
for that as well.
Thank you do you have any

Representative and senator you
have if you have.
A.
I think Senator Rodriguez Senate
bill one three five one five
three thank you.
Thank you madam chairman members
of the committee with a nice
committee to.
This is all we want to build no.
Truly a nice to meet you my
first time here is that in madam
chairman members of the
committee at where this is a
bill that is very highly
necessary for transparency and
disclosure and consent one fifty
three and it merely requires a
Legislative Council services
to publish on the legislature's
website a searchable list of
each appropriation contained in
the supplemental general
appropriations act in what this
is something we did the same
thing with the capital outlay
jail and what we do now is last
year we did yes one year on that
specific to what we call it a
junior there are.
Actual appropriations bills and
so what we need to do here is
very statute so that it
continues as I mean this is
on going so we don't have to be
doing it every year and that's
all it just Chairman it the list
will be published required if it
passes thirty days after the
legislative session.
Thank you Representative.
Thank you everybody have a great
security outside is excellent I
want to.
I really appreciate this bill
goes really well if we did last
year to ensure that our our
capital outlay spending was of
of.
Transparent and also when I was
talking about that way capital
outlay as it turns and districts
our district folks over the
understand the difference
between them they just know
these so tell them that one was
more difficult to get the
information off you know for
them from the capitol where the
other was reassess moves a
little bit difficult to talk to
constituents.
Okay all right.
The public comment I'm find out
if you have any questions for me
and what the fifty fifty all
right let's go to the audience
do we have any individuals in
support of this bill.
In opposition to this bill.
We'll go back to the webcast
seeing this committee members.
Representative.
More at.
Representative.
Senator moved it.
Four thank you do we have a
vision.
Seeing that please show all
present voting in the
affirmative Senator
Representative you have to do
passing lanes.
J..
That that matter I don't think
we said the magic words
correctly for the last bill
because of the Senate Bill
substitute as amended okay.
Already and I'm gonna reviews so
it doesn't matter yeah thank you
the.
It is.
The.
The.
I should feature thanks for.
I have feeding.
Yes
One I think that we do setor
income for.
thank you all righty let's move
to the committee says to Senate
bill five three as amended
Representative McQueen and
Senator Steinborn.
Mr.
The
committee pleasure to be with
you all today I Senate bill
fifty three of the for profit
conflict will
that will affect with decades
beyond probably all of our
lifetime
I what we.
It's a bill madam chair of eight
that does a few things number
one we have an existing law
right now the task force called
the radioactive consultation
passed with the executive level
Fast forward
of it looks at the federal.
We raise issues here in the
state and.
Are are of liaison with the
federal government on issues
related to related to.
Waste disposal of radioactive
materials with this bill does it
after I disabilities to that
list as we know we're dealing
with a privately owned facility
contemplating seeking a license
from the state for this would
expand the curfew the
radioactive task force to deal
with private facilities beyond
just federal Salisu would also
ask really important state
players they did that from the
passes walk the the regular
passwords including the homeland
security department the Indian
Affairs Department State Land
Office feast number one it's
real important the other
important piece that answers it
requires a report to the
legislature annually right now
the office regularly and with
early that meant number as a few
years ago so this way we're
required much more proactive
engagement owners act well on
right after this disposal issue.
Second thing though colleagues.
The most important part is
prohibiting the storage and
disposal the spent fuel for high
level nuclear waste in the state
of New Mexico.
In a disposal facility here
until and unless the state has
to work in the creation.
of storing this waste here in
our a federal repository is in
operation as defined by federal
law.
I just want to say I.
Federal law right now requires
that you'll be dispose of in
store and a fifty four five
four.
That's what's supposed to happen
that was supposed to have
happened in the nineteen
eighties and
It's so what what we're very
concerned about is that this
concept of a interim storage
release money off there is no
permanent repository existence
in the country this is for a
facility this licensed breeders
for per forty or by.
For canisters that themselves
are only license for four years
but authorities in operation.
That we perform.
But in New Mexico
Those in opposition to the bill
please raise your hands all
right we will start with
comments in opposition to the
bill right please please state
your comment within a one
minutes.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee job is a lap pool
yes we do respectfully oppose
Senate bill fifty three percent
of the report the work of the
Eddy and Lea energy alliance is
participating in the we were
in commission on America's
nuclear future.
If.
Federal law and both radioactive
health and safety requirements.
Recieves to circumvent the
vigorous review of the NRC I
requirements after more
excessively completed all
applications steps lastly and
most importantly Senator fifty
three papers for national and
global efforts to decarbonize
the energy sector and so for
research and development are fun
carbon free energy resources
nuclear energy provided fifty
percent of Americas carbon free
electricity twenty twenty one
making it the largest domestic
source of energy.
In twenty twenty two legislative
Harrison administrative.
Eliminate greenhouse gas
emissions from the energy
industry.
At
is a part of that solution.
Opposition to this thank you
madam chair members thank you.
Please madam chair vice chair
members of the community church
staff.
Should this for all to I want to
pick up on my caller review
these charges comments first
Senator fifty three is calendar
current Mexico law the law that
governs permission at dresses
Tomic energy act sure which
includes spent nuclear fuel
state law the first of the NRC
for permits regarding spent
reserve fuel also our point out
that folks act as signed a
memorandum of understanding with
the New Mexico building and
construction trades council to
provide workers construction
they're also Senator green is
with the hops Hispanic chamber
of commerce and.
Our branch talks rather posture
after the end of lease the
because text will also be
building a workforce training
center in the region and both of
those organizations with our
state thank you thank you
further comments in opposition
to the bill let's go to the
webcast.
would like to hear comments in
opposition to the bill stated
eight yeah.
Let me.
Not enough.
I'm not in a position to the
line in support of the bill all
right then let's stay on the
webcast and here committee
supported.
Parent.
K..
Yes I support this bill
I think that there are two
issues that are paramount here
one is the legacy of abandonment
of nuclear waste
Right with various parties we
have.
No cleanup
and no compensation the we have
the Tularosa basin down winders
they have not been compensated
just a whole history of the
federal government not cleaning
up messes they either make or
approve.
the abandonment issue is huge
and I think the other main issue
is.
The environmental justice aspect
where a lot of the
A lot of these wastes that have
not been cleaned up our.
On tribal lands for in the
majority minority areas time and
use of well I speak or please.
We heard comments.
One minute we have committees
for.
R. Gardner.
Yes ma'am madam chair and
committee members rose Gardner
from unison Mexico.
They're only counting where
Holtec thanks to have the
consent of the people but in
fact only have some businesses
let's be clear this is the
opportunity for them to make
money on the backs of New
Mexicans that are E. Safford the
story I nuclear waste in our
state and other abandonments.
Let's not let them have their
way New Mexico is the land of
enchantment.
We need to keep it as such we're
already building at around
nuclear waste
from every direction I live
three miles from a nuclear waste
which has a high level waste
license so unfortunately thank
you very much yeah.
Your next.
Good evening the committee I'm
in support of SB fifty three and
some details about this bill.
Our New Mexico has been the
nation's nuclear sector by zone
for decades this is a no to our
state become the dumping ground
for high levels of waste in the
nation's nuclear power plants
this legislation was
specifically what hands by
Holtec international district
commissioner commercial nuclear
waste of more than one thousand
acres of scrub them between
Carlsbad and Hobbs New Southeast
Mexico the what I was isolation
pilot project is in the vicinity
but there's only transferred
with which includes things like
tools including that have been
contaminated with radioactive
material the Holtec project
proposes the star spent doing
high level radioactive waste and
nuclear power plants across the
U. S. bring as much as nearly
one hundred and seventy five
thousand metric tons of high
level nuclear waste in New
Mexico the railways and if you
guys are aware of the Ohio
bureau went we know that kind of
accidents that can happen
so I'm just part of SB fifty
three and yes thank you.
Davis go ahead.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee my name is Rebecca
Davis and I'm a teacher in
Farmington New Mexico but I'm
here today as member of retake
our democracy I'm in support of
this bill and we we ask that you
do the same and support SB fifty
three there is a recent poll by
the center for civic policy in
the center Pacific action that
showed sixty percent of voters
that were surveys oppose the
project including those living
in southeastern New Mexico and
just as others have mentioned
there New Mexico has already
been in nuclear waste dumping
ground
radioactive waste from the
nineteen forty five Trinity
atomic bomb test was never
cleared up and has resulted in
high cancer rates minister on
communities the to the rest of
basin
uranium mining in the nineteen
fifties left more than a
thousand abandoned mines and
piles of radioactive tailings
mostly on tribal lands resulting
in intergenerational cancers and
birth defects so you know just
let's keep those in mind and
please support this bill to put
into time.
A hundred ally owns go ahead.
I L. this is a Lujan the
alliance from New Mexico
renewable solutions we just want
to support the Sanchez and bring
forth this bill as well as all
the groups that have been
fighting nuclear New Mexico
keeping in mind that while the
department of energy made the
nuclear clean energy here in New
Mexico we have seen the legacy
and what it really looks like
and I think a lot of the folks
were in support of this do not
live next to these facilities
where this waste would be stored
we don't want to see New Mexico
continue to be a sacrifice zone
the rest the United States and
so just thanking the sponsors
and all the folks of educating
its nuclear no no there for New
Mexico thank you.
Thank you Joan brown.
Yes good afternoon us sponsor
speaker committee thank you for
sponsoring this dental and I'm
the executive director for
sister Joan brown of New Mexico
interstate power light and we
have real concerns about this
project the cumulative effect of
all of the nuclear waste plus
the pollution and the effect of
the frontline communities from
the oil and gas industry in
their health as well we have
been dealing with this and whole
text since the very beginning
have gone down to the Roswell
and also Carlsbad for hearings
and even that with the whole
tech people down there and we
felt that they were very
disingenuous as a company we ask
who is going to be financially
culpable for any of problems and
they would not even answer that
question at one of those
hearings we were talking with
them so we also are in touch
with the leaders around the
country and have been informed
of people in New Jersey from
faith communities and in New
York who are very upset with
Holtec in what they've been
doing in those regions as well
so we totally support this we
have to protect our state our
communities and the sacred
Commission that we've been given
and if I might indulge you
sister Marlene parent could not
get online issues here and would
just like to speak very briefly.
My name is sister Marlene Perrin
and I'm very supportive of this
bill SB three twenty of fifty
three because of the who's that
our server funding that first of
all the canisters.
The safety of the canisters and
the safety of the canisters on
these railroad tracks and also
environmental justice why hello
and that is why geo political
justice why is all this waste
coming to
a New Mexico when we haven't
really had any
nuclear power plants thank you.
Thank you Josie go ahead.
Good afternoon madam chair and
members of the committee my name
is Josie and I'm from Eddy
County I'm speaking in support
of Senate bill fifty three I
keep hearing that locals one
whole tech in our community I'm
here today to disprove that
statement many locals and both
Eddie in the strong.
You know they have no voice
against politicians who are
cleaning Holtec is welcome there
will be many more opportunities
for jobs and new income in our
region many that will be safer
and still are and still large
scale such as wind farm projects
full tech is too high risk in
such a populated area even
transportation of the materials
will be high risk transportation
by rail will put each and every
New Mexico County it passes
through a state or region has
given the state more than enough
income and does not deserve to
be put at risk are there thank
you for hearing me today.
Thank you.
Of the self whatever that is go
ahead.
Apologies about the names exited
but also here with loss of
innocence to to we're working on
environmental economic and
social injustice issues are here
locally and nationally
for several decades I want to
commend the the members of this
body who have sponsored this
bill this is excellent an
excellent Act exercise of our
rights as a state excellent
exercise as to protecting our
public interest public welfare
our health and our wealth
wanting to add comments task
force can also consider we need
we need to continue to forward
studies and educate our
neighbors who are producing this
high all twelve nuclear waste on
a better security and safety
plan for managing this and also
further science to cease cease
production we need to cease
production if we cannot find
reasonable ways to manage it
then we need to cease production
until we can and we have not
proven that content in addition
to continue investigate the
extent of environmental public
health impacts current and past
as others have stated whole tech
has unfortunately left a legacy
of devastation and it's
disingenuous to offer a forty
year plan for chemicals that
have a twenty four thousand your
half life so these this should
have came with an additional
assessment additional data
additional information for this
body daily that is thank you
very much for your.
Joe Joe go ahead.
What's the madam chair members
of the committee my name is
Joseph Stacey I speak first as a
member of the Pueblo of the
gonna we know firsthand the
effects of living on radioactive
lands in fact you know some
places the radio activity is
starting to pick up again and
also as an organizer with
southwest organizing project our
membership in the southeast
quadrant as well as our
relatives are propose this
storage and we stand in support
of SB fifty three and would like
to thank sponsors and support
the everyone that's supporting
it as well thank you thank you
just health.
Thanks Margaret bell.
Yes madam chair members of the
committee my name is Margaret
bell I live in Albuquerque and
I'm speaking today in support of
Senate bill fifty three being
that dumping grounds for some
thirty million highly
radioactive spent nuclear fuel
rods is incompatible with New
Mexico's reputation as a world
class outdoor arts and cultural
destination the adverse effects
on our two point three million
dollar outdoor recreation
industry alone would be
devastating I think this health
we're and I just the committee
to vote yes on Senate bill fifty
three to protect our economy
thank you thank you Margaret.
June P. go ahead.
Yes thank you my name is June
persons are live in Rio Rancho
honorable chairman and
representative I support SB
fifty three because we New
Mexicans need our elected
representatives to ensure our
safety with legislation that
ensures the short and long term
health and economic well being
of New Mexicans.
That includes not contaminating
our land for their ensuring safe
surface water and ground area.
And our air so that we can have
safe healthy.
Life through our agriculture in
our drinking water we need
legislation that recognizes the
monumental risks of temporary
radioactive storage storage
guarding against disastrous
environmental consequences on
these casks that whose wall
thicknesses do not need the US
navy standards for storage and
my concern is that no other US
thank you very much you on that
is time thank you very much.
Also your sense in go ahead.
Thank you Mr chair members the
committee Oscar Simpson former
state employee he was for
regulate all and gas and
regulate public water systems
and grow the fresh ground water
supplies are in dire threat if
this proposed order if the if
the high level nuclear waste yes
great start leaks.
If you look at the accident
prone characteristics of
transportation by rail and the
lack of liability who cleans it
up and puts the whole New Mexico
at risk for planning out this
mess so fired you to strongly
support house bill Senate bill
fifty three and pass this
passage thank you thank you
Oscar next we have the courage
Jr.
Good afternoon madam chair
members the committee is
currently here director Luca
advocates minister New Mexico we
are here the staff because well
as we have the next.
The rest of Santa Fe.
We are supporting stating our
support clearly for SB fifty
three in a lecture time will
simply concur with comments
being made previously for the
bill thank you the Sanchez for
bringing this bill forward
urgent support for SD fifty
three as well thanks for the
options.
Thank you Kurt.
Representative said in the.
Go ahead Representative.
Thank you thank you Mr chairman
I agree with everyone.
What's been said we do not New
Mexico does not need to be a
Democrat for the United States
we do not need a high level
nuclear waste we there is no
permanent repository in the
federal government has been good
to us about cleaning up the
waste they've left specifically
uranium so we have no we do not
need this in New Mexico this is
just not it cannot be the
dumping ground for United States
thank you thank you
Representative.
Haley should go ahead.
Hello my name is Q. issue but I
live in Carlsbad I want to voice
my strong support for H. B. one
twenty two as you are aware but
often up here because the
failure of leadership in the
region southeast New Mexico is a
massive staff by well you likely
will not here for many everyday
people from southeast New Mexico
that is because many do not
understand the ramifications of
having the site such as full tax
so close to home because of
which many citizens have a
certain level of comfort with
the storage of nuclear waste and
don't realize the key
differences between the storage
sites such as wet and Holtec
chief among these differences
being the type of waste in the
practical tech is a private
company most everyday citizen in
this region have no idea that
our local community will have
nothing to fall back on to make
sure we are protected for
dangerous radiation protective
average go belly up if my fellow
community members and realizes I
think you would be hearing from
a lot more us I do employer are
Democrat led legislature that
supposedly strive to protect
communities to follow the lead
of Republican like Texas in
order to make sure that all
citizens of our state are
protected from having high level
nuclear waste stored in their
backyard lastly I want to say
that had strophic broadcaster no
high serves as a cautionary tale
for our state and we would be
wise COVID thank you thank you
Kelly.
Jason surely go ahead.
Thank you madam chair members of
the committee I'm speaking
against this bill and I hope
this is an appropriate time I'm
the president of the crosspad
Department development and I
wanted to speak a little bit on
community support we we've heard
from a couple of residents of
Eddy County that are against
this bill or or in favor of this
bill but the business community
a large resolutions from the
governing bodies in Lee County
and Eddy County are all in very
strong support of the project
and against this bill moving
forward we think it'll be a good
thing for our community we urge
the committee to vote against SB
fifty three thank you.
You the audience in the on the
webcast we let's go ahead and
finish are supporting comments.
Thank you.
The rain yes.
Good afternoon madam chair
members of the committee my name
is Lorraine Viegas talking pop
New Mexico I work in the oil and
gas industry and my route is
about twenty miles away from the
proposed facility I'm here to
let you know that the people of
my town Lea County do not want
this only people that want this
are the businessmen who keep
pushing the stability upon us
and the people who are persuaded
by offer even fancy buildings
and the people who work in the
industry a lot of people are
scared to speak out against it
because they do business with
the people but I know for a fact
that my people do not want this
bill please we do want to feel
peace please.
Thanks for the people of New
Mexico and protect the land and
put the people over business
interest thank you thank you all

Hi my name is Wendy at city I am
the.
Resident of San Juan County and
I'm showing my support for SB
fifty three
from an area of extraction and
seeing the remnants of
contamination over your
community and in decades I don't
want to see such conditions
continue to
go for communities that are
going to be held and and such
areas of what this
nuclear can come out to so I'm
in favor of helping develop with
thank this bill with the task
force and having the the
leadership of such voices as it
Indian Affairs the with that and
and and just to to get more of
the people on the ground
informed and not just let things
be just disco way thank you
thank thank you in the.
That go illustrious go ahead.

Of the yes go ahead of the next
I'll call you know.
Hello my name is Paul Pino was
raised up in terms of the New
Mexico I want you to please pass
this B. fifty three and stop
protect because people make
mistakes and accidents happen an
example of the Trinity bomb of
for my family members were
living forty miles from the
Trinity nuclear bombing in
nineteen forty five the
government made a mistake of not
evacuating Charles also like
they had planned my mother and
brother have both died of
radiogenic cancers after
suffering excruciating pain for
months one sister had thyroid
cancer and another has brain
tumors after the Trinity test
general groves who led the
Manhattan Project testified to
Congress he testified that
radiation poisoning is a rather
pleasant way to die twenty two
workers were exposed to
radiation that will and I hope
they don't die like my mom and
my brother.
Thank you Paul.
Next we have lorded go ahead.
Good afternoon madam chair
members of the committee I want
to voice support for SB fifty
three we're deeply concerned
about the possibility of
incidences and transporting
nuclear waste given the news
about these Palestine and on a
recent news and past experiences
with transportation of
radioactive waste in Laguna
pueblo I think it's a dangerous
risk for us to take and I fully
support every level of our
government and the refusal of
this that are C. permits to
permit the transportation of
this waste thank you are members
of the committee of madam chair.
Thank you so much I'll go to the
the little circle back to Joseph
go ahead gauge.
Hi my name is gauge on the
general manager of a materials
company here in Carlsbad New
Mexico.
and.
Do business all around this area
that we place an
I just want to strongly support
SB fifty three thank passed I
urge the committee to be
proactive rather than reactive
and clean up something that
could cause major major disaster
thank you.
Thank you gauge Joseph go ahead.
I appreciate you coming back to
me got the madam chair members
of the committee I want to thank
the sponsors for Act four of our
advocating and pushing for this
bill I am a registered lobbyist
for animated vocal and I I'm
actually zooming in from
Shiprock New Mexico from the
bashes story and and that.
Do you support this bill.
It's it's a personal to me the
my grandfather worked for Kerr
McGee
Hey can we lost many elders due
to the.
Sorry Joseph we lost all that go
ahead okay ed ed and I I just
urge this to consider the impact
of the nuclear energy has had on
tribal communities is that the
reality that nuclear energy the
is not clean energy I appreciate
other speakers who have been
talking.
The support at the end I
appreciate the work that's being
done to move our our state
forward thank you thank you all
right we have a couple of folks
who are having trouble raising
their hands I will call out
their names now and allow you
chance to speak of Bianca just.
You can use the search function.
Okay now we
gel Stacey.
He spoke
of Thomas the pre.
Okay all right thank you.
Other yeah that was I didn't see
it Thomas.
All right hello thank you for.
The of there's a couple patch
she we go ahead.
Thank you madam chair and
committee my name is Rep
Patricia she we I live in Gallup
New Mexico and I am in support
of SB fifty three
I feel this is unsafe because
they're planning for a forty
year time period.
It's just and reasonable to
think that these casts are going
to be removed in forty years and
I don't think they're going to
last as long as they need to
that's a major concern online
besides the transportation
issues another thing that I'm
concerned about is is hold tax
is all decked really going to
Wirth New Mexico's interest all
right now they're planning a two
of.
For radioactive water into the
Hudson River from.
Power plant that their
decommissioning
This bothers me and I wonder
just how many other power plants
they're going to do Commission
and send waste here.
So to me this project is not
safe up please vote yes thank
you so much that.
It's my name as well of bill
attitude go ahead.
Well you can go ahead on you
yourself.
All right bill we're gonna move
on Steve Coll.
Madam chair.
The committee.
My name is Steve Kaufman by
million Mexico.
We along with most of our
neighbors others we have
discussed this bill with in our
community are in strong
opposition to this bill contrary
to many of the of folks
testifying earlier the state of
New York against the bill many
many people down here are strong
opposition clearly the bills
being offered in the blogs
starting at the hope that the so
called.
In the.
You know it's it's not you're
you're the reason for opposing.
First of all you in the no never
have worked full to have no
financial interest most of the
people that I or against it
financial well.
A reason for posting this bill
as follows.
Asian prohibits the permanency.
Resulted the is in violation of
the equal protection clause
because it targets a particular
industries in particular thank
you Steve that is hi thank you
very much.
First UCC eighty Q. go ahead.
Hi my name is Ruth street all I
work at first congregational
United church of Christ I'm also
a board member of New Mexico
interfaith power and light I am
voicing my support of SB fifty
three.
I think one thing that hasn't
been mentioned by hearing
recently is the idea that the
nuclear waste is safer if it is
stored close to where is
produced and just taking it all
here it's it's out of our mind
people don't recognize that it's
something the.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Well bill give you one more
chance.
Though the bills yourself.
It is quite here yet bill I'm
sorry.
Sorry bill school you go ahead.
All right we're gonna move on
very white.
Yes can you hear me alright yes.
Thank you very much dean is
white and all right in the fall
in support health fifty Senate
bill fifty four of the calls of
up for safety reasons I think
that
the spent nuclear fuel should
not be stored or brought to New
Mexico I think that we have seen
plenty on the national news
every evening now of that speaks
to the condition of our railways
of the issue of terrorism either
domestic or otherwise is not
something that's going
Representative and the Catholics
themselves are deteriorating
after fourteen years he Terry
iterations is already showing in
the casts of deteriorating casts
would be making our way across
the country and
we have no way of ensuring that
to those cast would not be
leaking radio activity all along
the way.
Additionally sadly our federal
government has done nothing to
help that is time thank you very
much.
Corn go ahead.
She's in person outside so the
litter hi can you hear me with
the.
Thank you.
For yes okay.
So okay we're gonna go to
the members of the committee my
name is corn I'm up climate
action strategist with public
action lines and I'm here today
to urge you to vote yes on SB
fifty six.
The nuclear industry has a
global legacy of violence
against environment and the
legacy of violence on the people
of the land.
We need our elected leaders to
put a stop to the continued
investor takeover of our home.
The energy industry continues
and historically has always left
the people of the land out of
these discussions and decision
making processes if we say no
more.
Democratically all of your
constituents have our.
These projects and they say no.
We have all been saying no since
the literal beginning of the New
Mexico legislature itself we
have voted no and told industry
now but yet we are continuously
being harmed by the legacy of
nuclear mining dumping and
accidents in New Mexico.
I'm before signing any more
deals with Holtec or any
extractive industries this
legislation is a focus on a
legacy of harm that your
constituents are still actively
dealing with the public health
crisis around nuclear Harmon New
Mexico is exponential at this
point we have so many families
Representative here today that
are now dealing with a history
of cancer in our lineage to
focus on us SB fifty there is a
status review statement form W.
two thousand that is time thank
you very much.
Okay let's go to the audience
and I'm gonna give ten more
minutes for public comment in
support of the bill of perhaps
the state your name for your.
The deal is don't repeat Senator
and all start with my right for
the.
We're please.
That madam chair members of the
committee
my name is the only Morgan and
I've been working on this issue
since two thousand sixteen
before all tax educated you all
on what their plans were we need
here's the legislature to tell
everybody and many of you signed
letters against this project I
want to say thank you to madam
chair presenting a letter from
the representative there was
also a letter from the Senate
Santa Ana receive posing this
project and I wanted three in
three state again Navajo Nation
has a law against transport of
radioactive materials through
our land which this project will
violate madam chair and we need
that law for the safety of our
communities there's also
resolution picture truck chapter
in the next uranium mediation
with advisory commission so with
that I'd also like to state the
awful governors as unto please
have thank you so much for the
time and please let test is part
of the testing thank you thank
you Sir.
We had to put too much.
Good afternoon folks here I am
the duty over I am from that
level.
And I a for the vice president
for a small group they're caught
the look good at the mobile
version for safe environment we
support passage it is P. fifty
three thank Jo Jo white people
and the people around me
requests along the good act a no
in New Mexico the genius of
review as you can see.
I spent nuclear fuel rods are
much more dangers I will say
this in order to learn more
about nuclear power we should
propose to discuss have a
nuclear power plant on the Rio
Grande maybe we could put it
down in the box let's talk about
thank you
further supporting con ****
please.
Thank you the committee members
and and Sanchez Senator
Steinborn Representative point.
I am here in support of the bill
for stocking city agencies from
issuing permits for strong high
level nuclear waste my name is
Patricia Cardona I am with with
Sierra Club as southwest
Alliance for state future.
Both of which support this bill
to stop permitting job all of
the whole technicals I can tell
you right now that are all
working on a national level with
all of the decommissioning site
with it the commission he starts
off the east coast and the west
coast right to have concerns.
Also recognize unfair for New
Mexico to see all of the waste
from the ninety eight power
plants across the country.
Thank you very much Sir.
I thank you madam chair
unsupported from Santa Fe stands
SB fifty three I don't think
this whole project will be
either temporary or safe thank
you Sir.
Thank you madam chair that is
making sure the conservation
voters New Mexico.
I'm also what internet.
Mr Basil outlined the reasons
why this bill is not preempted
by the federal government Mr
Basil smells this is correct you
should listen to that and likes
Sanchez created pointed out the
issue here really is whether New
Mexico will be from the dump
ground for the nation's nuclear
waste I don't think any of us
one at please support bill thank
you madam.
Madam chair that by your this
will be working as four years
also because we have decades of
a workaround Environment justice
issues and support this bill
would thank the sponsors we also
want to see us stand strong
saying that we cannot be the
national sacrifice state for all
the basic ways that they don't
want to the other states want
again to really listen to the
generations of people that
suffer taxes.
The digitization of the recovery
still some first up this is the
first of their policy was health
it is horrible to deal with your
friend cancel your parents died
of cancer in your siblings all
having to deal with how I would
be all has just cost I just also
want to talk about.
The science of the experts.
Size of this this is not
basically people out to mother
nature.
And that's just the reality and
thank you recently should be
mass after I hi Carolyn but into
the chief of operations for the
governor's celebration since the
inception of this administration
she's standing stood in
opposition to the construction
of whole tech in southeastern
New Mexico and uniquely she
stood with her colleague from
the neighboring state Texas
governor abit in opposition to
the construction of this
facility she stands firmly
behind Representative McQueen
it's time for to day to pass
this bill thank you ma'am thanks
committee this Camilla I am the
director of the Rio Grande
chapter of the Sierra Club
Representative five thirty five
thousand members and supporters.
Nationally are organization has
studied the issue of where to
store high level nuclear waste
and the clear safest most
scientific solution is to store
it in the safest closest
location to a source Intel there
is a well identified operating
permanent storage site as
federal law requires federal law
is not optional.
Thank you.
Please.
Senator committee members
wanting to six Furman of a
grassroots organizer with the
group of all teachers called
demand for revolution formally
known as the nuclear issue state
group I wanted to point out that
we help conduct a statewide poll
from December that pass out of
Mexico voters if they want to
high level radioactive waste
stored temporarily New Mexico
voters.
They did they oppose the state
police.
Come to our already overburdened
state the opposition was across
party lines also across all
parts of the state in southeast
New Mexico which would be the
area most at risk we urge you to
vote to pass on this bill and
empower the state to prohibit
permits for this project which
we expect that our State
cedar river staff thank you.
Right as I'm the oceans share
committee members and a college
instructor in state.
Which is Albuquerque based I've
been referred to the.
Can humans have.
For over ten years and I want to
clearly state that
representative and national
security yes at a public health
hazard that is necessary for
today don't have to wait sites
through I want to use your words
as well as select a very very
important decisions today I what
you think about the long
district train route thank you
for schools community centers
tribal lands the train workers
that.
And lastly I would you please
keep in mind that the company
responsible for the horrific
Ohio free after that we all know
it happened your folks other
made the same promises about
safety federal officials make.
So in conclusion I I hope is not
lost so you all how many people
showed up here today to speak in
support of the bill and how few
people basically industry I
showed up against this bill
please take a moment to do
what's right passes the.
Madam chair members of the
committee on health ruling
president of the league of women
voters.
So he stands in strong support
of this bill for spent nuclear
fuel committee consists of
nuclear scientists and engineers
as well as scientists and
engineers in related fields
identified over twenty pages of
problems people expected more
middle impact statement which we
have sent to the NRC some of
these problems cannot be
addressed in the world to get
stability.
We also are strongly in favor of
meaningful involvement by state
local government and community
facilities.
We ask that you expand the
membership and authorities of
the task force which one of them
funded federal.
Can still negotiate on certain.
Yes this bill thank you okay I'm
exact match rate real quickly
please very quickly
well I have policy adviser for
the minerals and natural
resources department of the
state in strong support of this
bill we are one of the agencies
involved with with
This is a priority of the
governor and it's a priority of
our.
Yes good morning madam chair
members of the committee I'm a
locomotive engineer operate
trains across the state
Representative conductors
engineers the roads in the
state.
All tech program can be
absolutely perfect in every
aspect histories to be perfect
in every aspect what we cannot
depend on the condition of the
roads we cannot depend on what's
going on the road right now
because this year alone we've
had the rams cross the state and
stop the movement of goods in
this country for two or three
days at a time the ornament at
Laguna the real in it till our
even if the ram of Arizona and a
big one two months ago in
California stops commerce in
this country so we we would be
impeding and stopping a native
of state nuclear fuel rods thank
you very much please tell us
your name again Donald cables
okay thank you Sir.
Madam chair members of the
committee thank you of James not
to have the cabinet secretary
designate.
The universe Department and I do
stand in support of we have the
department of the city of fifty
three also to reiterate G. but
comments
We stayed up but to underscore
those and not to speak on behalf
of the local.
As you know they're online but
to reiterate a letter that was
sent to us as well on October
twenty nineteen opposing this
Application process and their
continued opposition of
this moving forward and then
also the lack of tribal
consultation goes back to
executive order one one seven

Number of twenty twenty two and
the we ordered one for four
point one January sixteenth two

to.
Of for more quickly please.
Madam chair and members of the
committee my name is Virginia
Miller.
And.
I have been living in New Mexico
for thirty years.
Working for decades to end
nuclear weapons and nuclear.
Because of radio activity is so
dangerous.
So I I strongly support this
bill for the safety of all of
people and all the life here in
New Mexico thank you K. and then
we had one more.
The point is that I had.
From New Mexico and I would like
to say that.
My student people have strongly
impacted by.
There.
Is.
We understand that many people.
The answer and other health
impacts the to the use of
nuclear power and use their the.
As long as I.
At the should have banned the
movie has.
As.
Increase.
Create.
That have that.
Well.
Radiation or with the.
Thank you all right we are going
to move on to the public comment
in opposition to the bill please
raise your hands if you're in
opposition to the bill.
We already did.
Webcast.
Okay committee members
Representative Hochman Vigil.
Thank you very much of Madam
chair members of the committee I
apologize for not being able to
be there in person today just a
couple comments
I've heard the my constituents
loud and clear on this bill I
will be supporting it I just I
have one concern madam chair I
think it's already been talked
about quite a bit but I'm still
not convinced that we're not
gonna be tied up and years and
years of preemption litigation
and I think that's unfortunate
for the state but I am in deep
support of this bill and I want
to thank the sponsors for
bringing it thank you.
Thank you madam chair
representative of the health
expert joining us and chair for
thank you for the robust public
comment I was precedent and I
think it's great New Mexico
state police today up regarding
preemption there is Senator.
Sept several up pieces of K.
five federal case law regarding
this and with the US report for
state of the US Supreme Court
upheld California's right to
dance and prohibit of new
nuclear power plants
specifically on the issue of
nuclear waste storage and said
that states consideration of for
example economic issues fell
outside of preemption issues of
regulating spent fuel
we're very clear on that the
this bills essentially tells Act
so but I just want to make a
statement madam chair all taxes
the room I would hope that the
state.
About us that we do not consent
we do not want the facility one
federal government to a consenus
process.
All tech would reevaluate their
desire to.
The state that doesn't want and
and we can of what the issue I
think that would be a good
business practice of the
December thing to do and so I I
don't preclude the possibility
that that will be the outcome of
this thank you thank you.
Representative Hochman Vigil are
you.
Are you finished with your
questions I'm done madam chair
thank you very much next I have
Representative on in Ortiz thank
you asked madam chair
representative I I do still
follow along with us
Representative will have some
questions regarding the
preemption issue
so you just break it down for me
a little bit every now
When this bill is enacted it
will be subject to to challenge
in federal court as preempted by
federal law right subject to
that.
Madam chair representative yes
some units this is certainly
health off of the challenge
thank you and madam chair
representative of anything so
You can basically count
anything.
So we'll be challenge I I expect
it will be I appreciate I most
comment in a good neighbor but
you know they're they're playing
and pushing a lot of money
towards this I would expect them
to not challenges the bill is
designed to
enforce the rights that New
Mexico has as this as a
substance that it's not we're
not regulate.
The safety regulations nuclear
start regulating things that we
have so the right to regulate
understand all thank you madam
chair.
and referred for the answer the
tenth circuit had previously
ruled a similar provisions in
Utah were pre empted by federal
law correct so madam chair
representative so wanna that is
correct it so the different
happening California with U. S.
Supreme Court sided of Utah with
that the state Utah.
when they were confronted with
an interim storage facility
tried to pass legislation
regulating spent fuel very
different which goes to squarely
federal authority of regulating
and managing spent fuel our bill
doesn't do that that was struck
down by the courts as
preemptive.
With important copy of that so
it was also not building used.
Just reporter after effect in
spite of what happened in court.
Thank you madam chair Senator
Representative I apologize
because I feel like we're if
you're gonna be answer the same
question over and over and over
but for something this important
I think you know just for
clarity's sake that that's
probably worth the time so and I
think the case that I've refers
really was like cold Alexander
go through and you Indians
verses Nelson correct
New Mexico is also in the tenth
circuit right.
So can you tell me why and you
did a little bit but if you
could please expanded widely
this bill will be treated
differently by the federal court
in the tenth circuit thank you
to I. you touched on.
Regulating spent fuel if you
want to expand on the
differences a little more that
would be harmful sure and madam
chair the ticket time to
introduce my expert witnesses
for us all as you heard from
earlier is general counsel for
sometime.
Yes so.
You taught tried to prohibit to
the number of areas
Any anything related to the
specific needs of proposed
private facility the try to so
outlaw contracts to do the
construction and tried to
regulate on safety related to
radio activity in the areas of
trying to prevent counties from
doing anything with
transportation so it's very
expensive.
I'm targeted.
attempt to ban.
And the difference here is that
All of this bill has done a
state where states have weird
New Mexico has authority.
Which is groundwater discharge
permits those kinds of things
those may not be issued unless
and until we get some
consultation and so there's a
permanent repository so it's a
very different approach and we
we have that the school well in
case you could be appropriated
the city guests electric
California case
most recent one was Virginia
band security lighting that was
actually hello US Supreme Court
so of all people justice Gorsuch
wrote
and sent where there is stated
for me it's not pre empted this
area and an office.
Currency is.
To note justice Ginsburg she
didn't sign on to the majority
opinion by Gorsuch is very
conservative she said the
federal regulation by the NRC
under the atomic energy act does
not mean states must authorize
construction of nuclear
facilities.
So that's just two years ago
that was from the Supreme Court
saying we're states have
authority they made to mess with
the status thank you very much
chair representative senator and
expert
So the sensor tool that all
safety regulations over nuclear
facilities are preempted by
federal law.
And for the quote that you just
speaking from the Supreme Court
public's clear that up so there
is nuclear waste that was
diverted from underuse get the
mountain facility and that's
being stored in Los Alamos I
believe correct.
Of the Madam chair
representative on the other half
was not up with some.
At.
So the licensing of store spent
nuclear fuel was conducted by
the NRCC established thank you
thank you I have sorry a lot of
questions but it's really
important madam chair
Texas lost a fight in the DC
circuit court and the peel about
the NRC approval of the Texas
tech facility correct.
The manager should know infected
still in the district there has
not been a decision Shendo
decision on.
And I understand that there is
an argument that nuclear
facilities can be regulated at
the state level for economic
reasons
and that's the best with the
case from California they were
talking about before
So my understanding please
correct me if there's something
that I'm missing here madam
chair.
If the logic in the California
case.
With the California as that
sorry state of California has a
law that says energy cannot be
sold at less than cost and
nuclear power facilities cannot
calculate the cost of disposal
since there were no jobs so the
regulation of power plant in
California were related to the
economics
So the.
If that makes any sense at all
can you tell me why that
argument would apply we stop.
Madam chair representative of in
in that case.
similar to.
But.
Senator Sanchez missing.
California's there is no
permanent repository so we have
no idea how long we will have to
store waste from power plants
which is very similar to what
we're saying
here with this facility in this
bill and it was those uncertain
costs.
It could be forever could be
forty years they just didn't go
and that is calculated in there
for electric rates so the
Supreme Court said.
Standards and in this case that
the health it was a band of New
top nuclear power plants.
Thank you late last two
questions madam chair Dave
answered them already but I'm
asking again thank
so the proposal type facility.
Would that be the ones being
is that temporary temporary
permanent wealth Madam chair
representative of the technical
name is a consolidated interim
storage facility that's the
technical amendment licensing
order C. I. S. up for forty year
license the problem is is that
we're Enron is really a misnomer
because there is no permanent
repository I lost my federal
funds which is bill also
references the federal
government is responsible for
creating EDOs for deposit for
that is the federal solution to
the state permanent storage as
material support animal you have
no permanent repository in line
behind it
becomes interim becomes a lot
more than just interim for forty
years so it's
With all of our contacts and
that's a that's a big part of
the concern for a lot of people
of the myself thank you very
much transaction last question
are there any other.
Waste repositories currently
open in the United States.
Madam chair representative no
not on this scale there is dry
cask storage what we're talking
about a dry cask storage is
what's known as the storage of
the spent fuel rods and drive
pass outside of the cooling
cooling Fund in the in the in
the nuclear power plants members
there are some of well they're
all and backstory on site would
powers the generator and then
you could call the storage
facility as well but there's no
national scale this would be
on.
This would be all put together
times to actually this facility
is permitted for would be
licensed to handle more than
twice the entire national
softball Senator feel.
Thank you very much for that
answered madam chair and senator
so I'm going to vote for the
bill but I predict Sliq to echo
what Representative Hochman
Vigil said that will be tied up
in court
with this case for a very long
time and it could cost a
substantial chunk of money to
the state and potentially
millions but.
If this is if the facility that
holds had proposed to build
we're not temporary
and may not have supported the
bill but I'm concerned that.
At yeah there's no such thing as
a temporary facility nuclear
storage facility especially with
in a circumstance like this for
no other facilities exist in the
country I don't see how it can
be for like temporary and once
it's opened it's going to be
permanent no matter the permit
process so you this is this is a
really tough issue for me
I don't.
I'm not confident that we will
necessarily rental lawsuits that
come out of this but the amount
of feedback that I've gotten
from.
People across the state for
people in my district and from
the environmentalist groups
their position means a lot to me
and I hope I am wrong about the
lawsuits to follow thank you
very much that was.
Thank you representative
Representative reading thank you
madam chair of madam chair
Senator Hemphill and
Representative.
I'm I want to kind of clear of a
lot of the.
Comments was was try to clear up
so madam chair and Senator the
associate one that mining of
uranium.
Madam chair representative now.
Madam chair Senator.
So if.
If there is a vehicle carrying
it was just make it hard right
the clear ways Amazon only forty
is coming from Arizona and is
going to Texas we would love
that.
Madam chair representative now
this this this spans the storage
and disposal of material in New
Mexico for the permitting
facility.
Yep
Madam chair and senator what I'm
getting at is the Interstate
Commerce that is regulated by
Congress we can interfere with
the transportation we can't make
a log thing.
And that's I'm just trying to
clear up a lot of this the what
it does what it.
madam chair and senator.
Can we what was passes can a
native Americans.
tried taking a up on its land go
with the go she ate withhold
tractor anyone go ahead and
start and have a nuclear
wayside.
Well it's a very legal question
madam chair I believe the answer
is no but I would I would defer
to experts.
Madam Representative ring that
is an interesting question do we
do with them sovereign nations
they have softened the third
this this is our also a the
highly regulated federal act the
it's possible they could
negotiate for one eight there
were I can remember.
All these twenty years ago in
Santa Fe
One of the local pueblos
expressed interest in it and is
actually used as a point of
leverage for what they actually
want that was the that was the
fall back position was the we're
gonna storming their waste just
noticing.
so yes we we you know they they
have a forty I I think what I
heard from the the the public
comments that's not something
they're interested.
Madam chair and then
Representative I've just pointed
tests was the example I mean you
know we we can't what what do
and I'm.
A lot of the mist known that's
going on from the beginning
anyway let's move now to the
bill so madam chair and Senator
I work on page two so we're
going to have nine members on
this task force when we get down
the line nineteen the task force
show would go need for the state
to the grocery with.
Mexico Madam chair
representative with that is for
reference to the federal
facility of low level way the
staff that this thing law that
was created actually for with
and they were designated as task
force with dozens in New Mexico
Shea.
All regarding west so that they
have a fully to low level laser
federal facilities not from a
high level.
Okay and madam chair and.
Of Senator is home taxes low
level or higher level.
Madam I love the.
With is what they call low level
waste which is known as
transuranic waste his defense
waste.
There.
Madam chair and
senators could
Could hold take high level
waste.
Thank go ahead and I don't know
what the proper way is but free
condition and if you will and
making a usable product that
they can sell.
Madam chair representative could
day I mean it's it's I'm sure
scientifically theoretical you
know it's you get a different
types of reactor designs and
here in this country we don't
have a raptor that that frankly
recycle spent fuel.
The reviews so.
And madam chair Senator we go to
page three one twenty five a
portion of the show I Stewart.
So is there a state law.
Any.
Your tier one or is that of the.
Please.
Mr chair.
Yes that's existing law.
State law state yeah.
Madam chair chair representative
green the reason is is restored
is because we rearrange the
language in the paragraph so
it's not that we just added
something we took positive to me
and maintenance as we
restructure share dress up with
the.
Of madam chair and
Representative what is the
penalty for storing that the.
The chair representative green
the likely result with the job
and jump to the action that
you'll stop and you'll you'll
fix the situation it's not
something you know something we
don't want to happen it's not
something we want to be
I thank you for or coaching
people for we want that to the
to stop yeah Madam chair
representative I would
anticipate that the storage of
that material without a federal
permit is of federal violations
what I what I believe and
while at the site that's what it
I would believe I think that
goes to the federal present
preemption that we're gonna have
a problem with but madam chair
and Senator I'm not real clear
on the website there was a floor
amendment proposed on one about
page four lines seven and eight.
Of I Senator Baca did was sent
off to it or not no madam chair
representative it was not
because they have overstayed or
two thousand with proposing
Senate Judiciary
they took out the language and
subsection C. of.
Thank you for that.
Chair of or.
Well guys are listening need to
make it clear.
So it's not clear what happened
there but the.
madam chair and senator so.
Holtec currently has a permit.
With success with to go ahead
and
Bill this
and then they got them use with
several different groups I find
that the real problem at that we
want to come in.
And stop something that is
currently on going.
Noting that that that action
right there would get us in a
lawsuit.
Madam chair representative that
the that's one of the critical
matters they do not have a
license yet.
They do not have a license yet
the nuclear regulatory
commission no guarantee they're
going to get one but others that
the rhetoric Commission is said
they're going to happen next
month.
So we actually have a window
here we have to pass the bill
before that actually occurs New
Mexico state and so that's an
important distinction that we
have this wonderful work there
actually get a life and you know
the other things are.
I mean that's you know they've
hired a contractor reason on
structures.
That will.
Madam chair and senator do they
have a tentative license or
anything started nothing at all.
manager there they're trying to
get a license for consolidator
storage facility Regulatory
Commission thank you.
They issued their going through
the process efficient
environmental impacts that you
know the federal government for
the act follow the series of
process and staff.
They're on that path but the
final pass which gives them the
green light has not occurred and
that's the license itself.
So
Madam chair and Senator
Representative at the New Mexico
is unique you know the you know
it's a mineral rich state you
know what SO uranium war is
found across the state is that
correct.
Service is I mean there are
deposits of it that are around
the state.
All over the state and parts of
the state.
And madam chair and.
Senator so if we look at our
big.
military bases.
We have a couple in the really
come to mind real quick that
deal with really economic grade
high grade of nuclear material I
would say Sandia labs and
Los Alamos labs I think we would
all agree so we have if you will
a great above.
High grade uranium you know with
those locations so for us to say
there's not uranium or high
level uranium in New Mexico.
Thank would be of the nineties.
And if I don't know if you have
a comment the one on that.
Well I think a lot of what we're
dealing with here miss madam
chair is it's a generational
followers from spent fuel which
is the vast majority of it I
think a point was made earlier
that we don't have the nuclear
power plants in New Mexico yes
we do get a little bit of
nuclear power from
Hello early results but are we
are less than one half of one
percent of the country's
population so.
You got to consider the social
justice of that is you know you
look at left we take we take
currently that true waste from
all over the country from
facilities other Los Alamos
pandemic the place is Savannah
River so.
Active Los Alamos does the work.
it's.
The federal government to a
consent based process that leads
to a different outcome.
Madam chair representative if I
may I mean you New Mexico has
a has a lengthy history in all
things right
from the from the mining of
uranium from that project that
was mentioned in the the trainee
tests and winders
with and we did the way I view
that is.
There are a lot of we bring
detriment as a result of that in
that we've done our part yeah so
the idea that we should now
accept not not nuclear industry
in the nuclear power nuclear
waste from around the country
and created in Mexico.
Into the roasting our own way
that's not what I want for the
future.
And madam chair and
Representative I totally agree
that we have bad actors in the
original uranium mining in the
sixties of and that they want to
have an abandoned mines and
stuff like that I want to be in
our super fund cleanup so I
totally agree with that I am
glad of that federal money laws
changed to address that and you
know I think today is a
different era
I agree with the down payment so
I think that they were not taken
is the one that was.
They didn't understand what they
were going to do with the
nuclear bomb the yes.
And they in fact there was some
discussion would this be so big
that it would disintegrate the
plan you know because they
didn't know what they were
doing.
but I agree that the down
lenders have an issue in the
should have probably holier of a
larger area temporarily if
nothing else.
My mom was actually an el Paso
and happened to see the flash
you know and described it to me
you know what happened so yeah
it's
so anyway I agree about the
district
madam chair and of Senator
Representative so let's assume
you know hold a we don't have
the federal government is and
there's a we're gonna we're
gonna come to you in March and
we're going to give you the
sense.
Is there anything to indicate
that there are not going to get
a permit us.
And then and I. H. S. compound
questions what we're gonna do if
let's say March first they're
given apartment.
Representative
So this coming question I think
first off you know what passing
for passing this bill would do
is give us let.
if we give us leverage at the
negotiating table who would give
us leverage with the federal
government in the anticipate
their statement that this is
something the state of New
Mexico does not want
or governor has been very strong
in this regard and I and I'm
confident our governor is has
been and will be talking to the
federal delegation and the
federal government to make it
clear that they should not
proceed down this path
if it happens anyway.
There you know because
Department they still need to
build the facility and we're
saying that the routine rates
and forty over some of those
actions and if they can't the
facility we carry within the the
nuclear safety regulations
things like that but we can
still issue building permits and
we can still specify that with
the the roots in the thickness
of the asphalt and things like
that those are please powers
that remain vested in the state
of New Mexico that we can
continue to exercise.
Madam chair and senator so.
There was a group that actually
asked me as a police officer
come.
And it is for nuclear transport
so I have a little bit of
knowledge and.
Is the high level radioactive
materials transported by rail or
by truck.
Madam chair representative great
question it will be brought in
by rail Holtec it shows a map of
the first year we had
radioactive hazardous insurance
committee is that here there are
often indexes this with all
parts of New Mexico.
What recently came out of the
federal documentation of federal
government estimated to be
thirteen rail accidents over the
course of the shipping.
The other important point to
note here is that for tech also
was transparent and saying if
there's an accident and will be
the responsibility of the local
government in the state of New
Mexico to do emergency response
the growth out present so so it
will all be coming on a rail
we'll be coming in with armed
are very top secret we won't
know about it communicate state
right before they ship it and it
will in fact come for all parts
of the state including County I
mean there's a lot of.
Yes madam chair and.
Senator I don't want to go into
too much about how it's
transported.
But that's not totally correct.
And you know I trade with that
group as well.
Of the right to get the to the
top one of their friends for
officers.
anyway we'll move on from there
are you know what of this is
archived and I think some of the
information needs to be kept
close to the vest small leave it
at that I madam chair and
senator I agree the the
preemptive alright this is very.
Very problematic.
I look at this much like I look
at the Texas New Mexico water of
lawsuit.
And I don't know how many
millions we've spent on that
but.
It's in the
Hundred million I think his word
is in our tens of millions of
least anyway
I I think.
I understand this
I think this is a good
discussion point I think this is
a good shot across the bow of
the regulatory.
Group to come and sit down but I
don't think this is ready for us
to do right now I don't want to
put us in a lawsuit thank you.
Thank you Representative
Representative little and
Representative Chasey and
Representative block.
Thank you.
thing to the madam chair thank
you senator and representative
and thanks for.
Forward going to the specifics
of the bill
I do appreciate that the and the
addition to expand the
membership is still.
Why consultation doesn't take
place immediately I think that
that is.
Practice and that is change so I
appreciate that.
That is just a news that there
will be some.
This is the secretary would
become part of this this is not.
I want to make sure I put out
here is this is not take the
place of tribal consultation.
With tribes is this I think it's
great that includes a secretary
of the department of homeland
security.
And.
And I appreciate the the
information that we heard
earlier appreciate the
information that whole tax
lobbyists production we earlier
this week and I did have a
chance to go through it and read
the information I came away with
more questions than it did a
which I think that then in
addition to the conversation the
discussion that we're having to
do here today here is really
helpful.
I'm and what I want to bring it
back to.
To a couple of issues madam
chair.
The presenters on the issue of
public health and water and they
can be.
First or second it doesn't
matter because one affects the
other.
And
I heard that the safest method
and most effective method right
now especially since there isn't
already this this type of
facility established is that it
is should be safer stored onsite
quickly say for instance easier
so.
I wonder why you.
Why why.
Take the time to transport as
the lobbyist describing to me
these are coming from areas
outside of New Mexico and and
not short distances either I
understood that it was in the
northeast.
The east coast and other areas
and so I'm not an expert on this
by any stretch of the
imagination however I have some
background in public health.
And in the area of water
At description was provided to
me and of what that process was
in the cooling so I was curious
your your experts or someone
else can answer this question is
so I saw a thousand acres.
for the side and I'm curious as
to how many acre feet of water
is expected to be used.
Madam chair of Representative
that's good question title now
okay and I saw the gentleman
from home taxing line but the
description that I have of this
book in here the information
that was left for me says it
clearly there's a fuel pool yes
that has water or a liquid
substance so I okay you're
shaking your heads again that I
get wrong information.
You that.
I just I'm sorry is the
gentleman behind.
Okay I I apologize I'm sorry I'm
new here so I'm going to go back
to my questions my apologies
mentors of little if I may so I
don't think it's a a big water
user I think there's probably
some water and all the
construction once once it's
constructed it's very static
site that probably have drainage
issues and the make sure it's
dry things like that okay so the
the biggest issue with water is
the threat of contamination in
the the nuclear waste as as I
understand it it's important Dr
hello this is additional radio
radioactive the risk would be
that there would be an accident
I think you're exactly right
about moving increase distances
and.
Picking up loading and
transporting it taking off on
the those are the most dangerous
time perfect it's much safer
keeping it single location and
is moving around if there was an
accident Mr fire then
potential you're looking at
contamination and that's where
we have a large impact on water
resources thank you I appreciate
that quicker spots and I don't
want to cause us more but it
does it is pertinent madam chair
to the discussion of public
health the issue of water being
contaminated I'm curious as to
no matter how big or small the
amount of water it is it's being
carried it there in this is
going to be released or dried
it'll evaporate into the air for
it will be absorbed into the
ground before and some method
it's going to be disposed of.
Where what I'm looking at the
public health issues because you
know I've heard discussion
talked about the loss depending
on from this that could be if
it's challenged and I wonder
into the cost of human life.
And if from my experience in the
past with.
Oncologists from you and them
the experts in diagnostic
diagnostic oncology.
Is still.
Relevant or is
that.
About ten years or so ago.
And our tribal council and I.
Do respect our tribal council
and I'm speaking out of the
from previous where they were
very concerned about the high
rates of cancer and not just any
cancers.
These were the most and I hate
to use this word madam chair.
sponsored Representative.
Exotic for cancers that are not
found excess and Sarah re repair
system patients.
And
The incidents of these clusters
in and around the the Rio Grande
Valley this area of New Mexico
and southern New Mexico.
There are.
Educated guesses and out of well
how this may have happened but a
large number was attributable to
the radio activities that too is
present in the state.
And it was heartbreaking these
to see tribal community members
and had to suspend it very old
communities that have been here
for so long.
Affected by this and higher
rates.
I.
I am very concerned about how.
This.
An accident one or half the or a
small amount of release can have
an impact on this.
We've had the past experience in
the state of those types of of
Of of fallout and we are seeing
the results of that.
I want to.
If.
Well I appreciate that this may
be an MFF Namik Development
options.
It could be I wonder why we
would want to move toward
something.
So much more
with risks involved.
Purses at one of the commenters
stating.
Using.
Diversifying continue to
diversify and why would we want
to bring other states why would
we want to bring the trash for
nuclear.
Waste from other states into the
state.
Madam chair and representative
two quick answers they want to
do it so they can create more
of.
And this is sort and services
businesses and the communities
themselves along the way I mean
it is literally.
Putting it off on us and because
they can cause the federal
lawsuit deficient that company
can apply for licenses pieces
there's and families are making
national policy the absence of
Health that federal government
now wants to be a success based
process to support the know
about they're spending millions
of dollars actually do a
collaborative operations if
anybody wants this taking a
totally different approach.
And that's that's really good
now the Economic partially
product is really important
because.
Governor has federal government
thank you for pointing to Senate
that this could be economic
malpractice this this proposal
for New Mexico and the reason
that taxes also talked a lot of
kids that she's left on the
street is because this facility
in this place is going to go
right through the Permian basin
through the heart the most
productive economically
productive wealth region in the
country one of the most
productive in the world so from
that standpoint if there is an
accident.
In that region publishing
talking just lost connection to
our state that we we're counting
on right now and you got to put
that in context of thinking
about protecting our interests
legally but up.
But I agree with you I mean it's
it's not.
If you look at the cost benefit
analysis
the potential costs are much
greater than the benefits it
will Madam chair representative
the reason I was I there's
money.
So I mean this is a huge problem
that the government has appeared
out federal government as a
figure out what to do with.
The company will take as a
contractor to make a lot of
money pulling that's part of
this waste for the for the
quote.
there with the investments made
in the local community
construction costs some short
term jobs no long term jobs
wanted to there would be an
influx of cash that some people
in that community with that.
A lot of people that community
with the and I think statewide
you know on the whole this is
just that for New Mexico so it
is sort of this you know of any
of the capture profit.
A lot of profit potential but
for small people and the cost is
for the Cup process that.
Thank you thank you for your
responses I am.
Really and supportive of
economic development ventures
but I am very.
Fearful of this one and
yes is some of it may be based
on the information is out there
but doing my own research having
that public health information
solidifies for me the risks that
are present with this but I do
hope that there are other forms
of economic development that
will take place in these areas
and for different communities
with that thank you madam chair.
Representative for.
Your answers.
Representative Chasey.
Thank you madam chair thank you
senator thank you Representative
and thank our expert witness.
Let me just say that I believe
we actually.
Are compelled to pass this bill
and have it signed into law and.
It's just for reasons the
Interstate Commerce Clause isn't
active in the U. S.
constitution.
And what it does.
Is it essentially says.
In cases like this this is from
nineteen seventy nine the city
of Philadelphia versus New York.
Said US Supreme Court case.
If the state has a lan just an
ordinary land.
It can't close its borders to
other states to bring your
waist.
Then I that.
Do
you have a.
Whatever it is adult the storage
facility whatever the state
can't isolate itself in the
stream of interstate commerce
from a problem shared by all.
And so that's a disincentive.
For states that have nuclear
facilities.
To create their own websites.
They'd rather get rid of.
It I shouldn't say that.
So
and then with regard to
preemption the state has to
prove prohibit municipalities
from permitting.
The
Storage because that would.
Being that.
A city or in the and this
apology or counties would make
decisions not only for the whole
state.
Senator.
So that we have to create.
The parts of the state from
doing.
And
So I it.
It's a compelling when you hear.
Testimony that the storage
containers themselves.
Our.
projected to be safe for forty
years and then the half life.
So is there some issues had but
it's not with a half life of
twenty five thousand years so I
I just think and I'm I'm sorry
to my old friend and colleague
out there who I know was on the
other side but
definitely voting for this bill
thank you madam chair thank you
Representative block thank you
madam chair thank you senator
and representative for this bill
and then having this discussion
because we're all talking about
this topic so.
This is my understanding that
whole tech currently has federal
approval not not license or
anything but federal approval
via their confinement or
compact.
Statements.
Representative.
Madam chair representative
locked now because the word you
used approval like to note that
they have a green light to go
ahead and do this the job.
Job it's like a it's going not
only that you know they've
they've they get a proceed Pasco
you know they are still doing
that but they haven't.
Thank you madam chair very much
Representative so would they
have the recommendation that
Madam chair representative.
Representative I don't
appreciate that and the reason
is is it was and it was
initially the federal minister
for the past the faces that
they've gone through however
Madam chair just I really don't
know the answer to this federal
government was connected to this
and and he and I rate them they
said they got new security I
think it's very related
questions information from all
that they were pushing it back
on I think this is like the
third or fourth time they push
this whole process back so.
I think they could very well be
very interesting what we're
doing here the state in Mexico
to so I want to create jobs that
they have a lock on a license.
We don't know that K..
Okay thank you madam chair thank
you representative and senator
so.
I mean I read the study the the
report the product on it said
that it recommended issuing a
license the whole tech based on
an environmental review and said
even if an accident happened
during transit of the waste
releases of spent nuclear fuel
would not be expected from the
proposed shipments according to
the assessment Senator
Representative is that an
accurate statement.
Well they Madam chair
representative they they gave a
low probability of radiological
release however that doesn't
give me any comfort.
The look at which is happening
thousand.
I'm sure that companies that.
They were about to create an
environment awards and activate
the community so the fact of of
around with with a hundred
percent that there would be a
radiological release now.
This is an Madam chair
representative
It was would you read doesn't
give me much comfort either the
the same as the the the the real
shipments for travel those fees
have armed guards I mean that
doesn't make me feel better you
that sounds to me like something
that's inherently dangerous and
if you look at the history of
environmental disasters
industrial accidents they're
almost all things that we were
told percent.
First there until there so
they're not they're safe until
there is an accident and then
you know maybe they do a post
mortem of acts and they said oh
well X. Y. and Z. went wrong we
didn't think they would.
But things things happen we just
whether it's human error or you
accidents or yeah worst case
scenario you know the tech
support it's like a car stuck on
the tracks stuff like that
things happen the fact that
they're contemplating accidents
already.
Doesn't doesn't Richard.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Senator Representative those
answers so you mentioned these
policy higher chair
representative can you tell me
what happened in these policies
and what.
What the train was carrying
madam chair and senator Madam
chair representative I'm not an
expert what they're carrying
chemicals that obviously in the
explosion.
We obviously the outcome of that
is.
And I'm not.
They're obviously different
situations but the point is
Israel accidents happen this is
gonna be on rail and the federal
government is a report estimated
up to thirteen relaxes same
report you read I'm sure you
read that as well the estimated
a loss thank you madam chair
representative a have to
through the center I don't think
we know the consequences.
And I don't think we will know
that for a long time I mean
there is it a.
Fire the smoke spread of those
chemicals and I think we'll be
assessing the health impacts of
that accident protective.
Thank you madam chair thank you
senator Representative so from
my understanding that that
happened because of plastic
pellets that were on the train
Madam chair representative
that's what caught fire after
there was impact so that
overheated so madam chair
representative senator.
I believe that this proposal at
least from this company.
In New Mexico hope that is to
have a special train
specifically for nuclear waste
is that correct madam chair
representative.
Madam chair representative yeah
it's because of the weight of it
they're going to have to make
special accommodations one thing
I want to point out
Representative I think so
important for all of us to now.
Office what's planned there were
fans go south it's with things
are planned of the chair of the
state's radioactive and
hazardous materials committee
okay happened for about for six
years and you look at the access
that occurred with plant you
know we had a we had a billion
dollars and one most expensive
in our nation's history because
they put the wrong kind of Kitty
litter.
Senator Robinson there are ways.
That wasn't planned so
Representative said earlier
there are problems with rail we
have a locomotive experts say
there's problems.
These events are always
anticipated so I any I respect
your questions but it's it's
just you have to be very humble
about things happen.
Thank you madam chair thank you
senator Representative so.
Talking about the study that
thirteen incidents out of how
many incidents did they say
thirteen what happened madam
chair Senator Representative.
So we do ask and ask questions
so Madam chair representative
senator according to the study
the from the New.
And Garcia Madam chair Senator
Representative out of how many.
With the thirteen the out of
regarding the incidents that
could potentially occur madam
chair.
Wealth manager by the state by
Representative every ten
thousand cast shipped over
twenty years the talking about
US thirteen rail accidents
involving those ten thousand
cast.
Okay thank you madam chair thank
you senator Representative and
how many.
Of these infants have already
happened Madam chair Senator
Representative regarding the
right and this company.
Well.
Chair maybe they have not.
Regarding this facility not of
the shipments of half right so
so they have there's been no
shipments to our facility if you
have any of those accidents
happen that's what the estimate
will say I had a conversation
with the shipping company
kind of interesting side effects
opposition with the company that
they're going to hire the fault
at low transport who does the
part of should be not too much
Representative and they did have
a relaxing in their history of
the company.
The.
And then it happens.
Madam Madam chair representative
or senator so just what I'm
looking at the statistics on in
New Mexico I am not aware of any
of these infants in our state as
of now currently with
transportation nuclear what is
that correct Madam chair
representative senator efforts.
Sure sentences they haven't
start shipping this.
Thank you madam chair
representative so any other
companies have ever occurred
have we ever had nuclear waste
transported to our state before
Madam chair Senators.
The chair representative we we
certainly have that nuclear
waste transporters stated
it is a fairly regular basis I
see the the trucks going down to
eighty five with this very close
to go through my district very
close to my house
but that's the the little
transuranic waste to different
ways of the stuff we're talking
about has been largely stored on
site generation and we're I
think it's pretty clear is the
safest place to keep it and so
when you ask that there haven't
been any excess returns waste.
You're right and nothing to keep
the.
Senator Representative so are
these tasks that they would be
putting this week and are these
resistant to earthquakes Madam
chair representative senator.
I'm Sarah Representative you
know they've done studies
they've done John R. modeling
that again.
You know what you are about this
safety is it's not often account
for which you don't plan for and
so again you have to factor that
into.
Validates.
Thank you madam chair thank you
senator representative Ives
suits and through.
So you know I'm also concerned
that the other members about the
litigation regarding.
Preemptively stopping.
Whatever you're trying to
regulate I believe storage and
disposal madam chair
representative can you just walk
me through the California case
said earlier I'm sure Senator
Representative Sir and chairman
of that work thanks for the tip.
Madam chair representative
That case was specific gas
electric.
Is.
It came about because California
which handed over of nuclear
power plants
Question came up about
permitting.
Another
and the.
Passed a state law saying that.
no to that permitting anymore
because it was largely on
account for economic reasons
because of the economic
certainty have to calculate
Graeser years into the future
still.
Permanent disposal option so how
are they calculated.
Yeah that was we don't know
what's gonna cost that was a
thank you madam chair thank you
senator.
So it's my understanding that
California law that party
regulated all utilities and all
I believe it was all electric
utilities specifically so this
would be include.
Preempted the nineteen seventies
legislation.
Federal level so madam chair
representative Senator experts.
Do we have any kind of loss
similar California that preempts
that Madam.
Madam chair representative
Preemption is a matter of the
forty.
Hi.
So if you pass a law before the
federal government does and then
the hassle of printing you they
have the greater authority.
So it's it's it's just the way
it works at the federal
government for into the the
broad authority to do so.
Thank you madam chair thank you
senator Representative I
appreciate that answer I think
there are many nuances here
think that setting specific K.
five subject right every case is
different every state is
different at different laws so
specifically New Mexico I'm
reading this letter from.
Over twenty general part all
there just.
And he cited that we don't have
this authority to regulate these
nuclear industry in many ways I
think even including in
transportation madam chair
Senator you know he said the US
court of appeals is found that
the federal government
effectively contracted to
dispose of spent nuclear fuel
through the end of his creation
of the nuclear waste fund and
then said you have also inquired
about.
Rueful prerequisite for the
licensure of an interim storage
facility managers so he said
well there are a large number of
factors considered by the NRC
evaluating the license
application the state approval
is not among them chair Senators
so what was her response that
madam chair
well that was an Attorney
General opinion I requested the
chair of the committee precisely
because I was getting this
information about did we have
right of consent that I kept
hearing what we have to consent
consent I wanted to know as a
state do we actually have a
threshold that we get
concessions Attorney General
came back and says well which is
a terrifying decision because
this part of my education in our
state said sorry you don't
actually as a state get to
consent or not consent to having
said that I think with that
internet general opinion fell a
little bit short with education
center this issue of of the
California Pacific case that
went all the way to the Supreme
Court to look at the Utah case
law which is certainly important
for what you talk trying to do
and how they try to deal with
the didn't deal with the with
the really.
The federal Supreme Court.
Situation and say here's what
the state do that falls outside
of preemption.
Which within helpful
information.
yes that's certainly part of our
consideration our state
the chair of the if you look at
the the bill the the language
sort of falls into two parts
this section do inception see
section B. as the consent in
the requirement the costs for
the vote for the consent is his
friend it's possible that
section B. is preempt.
It's possible but we want to
make that argument that we have
the the ability of the state.
But then there's also a second
see insurgency relates to
permits contracts leases
licenses you know other things
that the federal government has
not.
So that's that's where those
provisions broken parts that's
why there.
In the bill because two separate
approaches trying to get this.
Thank you madam chair thank you
senator representatives answers
I appreciate that you know you
did say there was a chance right
there is a chance this could
happen in this case in court
Madam chair representative I
just wouldn't want that for the
taxpayers are no one wants to
end up in court at all I'm not
sure and I'm sure you guys don't
but you know I just think we we
just want to look at other
states the time that they had
something I know they didn't
build that the plan after all
but they did get that script and
court so madam chair Senator
Representative
You said that your big concerns
regarding how far you would have
to travel these hello it's you
have to travel and how unsafe it
could potentially have we heard
madam chair Senator from other
states concerned about this
plant in New Mexico and
traveling throughout their
states we.
L. as or anyone other than the
state of Texas madam chair.
Madam chairman of we've I set up
my big concern Representative
early thirties relaxes we should
consider that
there any other long term have
but having said that yes I
participated actually in many of
the public meetings help up to
the right.
Yes of this license application
blown left people fall over
countries really made me
appreciate how this is a
national issue the only weapon
that this decision affects
people other side of the country
is as a result of this
potentially is going to have a
nuclear waste asked one by their
house I heard a gentleman from
New Jersey talk about how he
lives in an area where there's a
rail bridge going kind of over
his house and he's worried what
would happen if there was an
accident cast those are you know
by by his home I realized the so
yes people all of the country's
office.
Because this is going to affect
everyone nationally this waste
is going to ship across.
As a result potentially impact
not just once I should say I
because it would come once to
enter visibility and then if
there is permanent facility
that's mission of plaques so you
could tell that thirteen
accidents to.
Thank you madam chair thank you
senator Representative so then
why do you think people want to
come to New Mexico to deposit
and stores this hello it's madam
chair Senator.
Representative gets rid of their
property taxes are problems.
Thank you madam chair thank you
senator Representative I believe
it's it's my understanding at
least that New Mexico claimed it
was so dry the logically were
very stable place to have this
so with the dry and arid climate
is ideal for underground storage
have you heard that as well
madam chair Senator
Representative.
Here Representative that's a
technical question is being
evaluated I many experts also
the state of New Mexico wasn't
cooperating agency medical
office agency but they have
status where they could give
technical feedback.
In less than a more lots of the
state concerns about this site.
And so sometimes experts don't
agree happening up the mountains
and.
So in that case you know this is
not resolved issue even
technically.
Okay thank you madam chair thank
you senator Representative so do
we know of any adverse effects
that could happen to wildlife.
Around the storage facility
managers Senator Representative
well we've studies radiation
exposure Committee legal.
Madam chair representative
senator I mean specifically.
This company have you seen any
kind of.
Wildlife factors that have been
brought up specifically with
this company and the way that
they transport and store other
Madam chair representative no
not specifically I'm aware of
but I will say I did query the
Nash the Regulatory Commission
see the last ten years of
nuclear safety records address
that storage there was also a
hundred safety and senses and
there was more than a handful I
health as well so now did that
result in a legal incident no
not that I'm aware of but you
have to magnify the amount of
fuel to dry cask storage now in
a limited about shipping its
thank you get a bill that out
over a factor of ten or a
hundred or whatever when you put
the entire nation supplies dry
castle which ship the entire
nation supply here then you're
doing a back into that whatever
data you have.
Thank you dentures as a
maintenance you know I I think
there is the wildlife is
similar to the rest of people in
that the risk will would arise
from the.
If there is no incident yeah I
mean I I don't think the store I
don't think there's radiation
emitting from the storage site.
Normal course it's it's the
things as for Senator Steinborn
says that we don't anticipate.
The report of the additional
and for that you know people
weren't feeling well that's for
dying Fischer die I mean that's
that you know if you're
concerned about affects all of
which which I appreciate that's
I think have with errors thank
you madam chair thank you
senator representative okay so.
So the storage and
transportation of both what you
concerns with.
Well I mean I guess would you be
open to a nuclear power plant
from this company opening in New
Mexico so it doesn't have to
transport it so far chair
Senator Representative
Madam chair of the we have a
building nuclear power plants a
long time is it too expensive.
Thank you for the participants
chair representative is we can
figure out what to do with the
way.
Thank you madam chair thank you
senator representative okay well
I appreciate the answers and one
more point I just want to talk
about so regarding the I
administration twenty twenty two
they released.
There are
He was part of the inflation
reduction act Madam chair
representative senator they
mention at fifty percent of the
energy in the country.
Carbon free energy is made up of
nuclear energy so madam chair
Senator Representative do you
see nuclear energy as a as a
potential.
Clean energy to use in the
state.
President I have said etcetera.
Well personally madam chair.
I'm conflicted on a I'm all for
carbon free generation of power
but as I educate people around
the country as a New Mexicans
call player Energy plane when
you have the legacy of the of
the thousand plus abandoned
uranium mine sites contaminated
land generations of people who
are safe no responsible party to
hold up still not resolved
so so no I'm not I'm not for
arming future generations.
At all and so what I prefer
other forms of renewable energy
they don't have people yes and
including looking at
conservation and reduction in
demand side management other
energy energy management tools
that you know they'll put you
into that false choice so.
Thank you madam chair now
this is a president and his firm
energy has launched the consent
they Scott says to say we also
should not be shutting this
waste out of state strategies.
They appropriated millions of
dollars in the currently as we
speak soliciting feedback he is
about to select the university
communities that actually have
demonstrated support to move
forward in a you know a
collaborative fashion to
consider works with the school.
Thank you madam chair thank you
senator Representative has
president Biden and his
administration oversee the US
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
not not entirely about chair
date except it's independent
commission and is that the
president has an appointment on
president trump has won an audio
of perhaps previous presidents
to as well and so it's that kind
of administratively attached as
we might say the department of
energy but it's an intense.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative and no I
appreciate everyone piece today
and and spoke about their
stories and their concerns you
know I think there are concerns
that we all work together on hi
some of this bill as well but I
also want to look at other forms
of energy Madam chair
representative somewhere that
have impacted negatively people
because if you look you know per
per unit of energy produced
madam chair nuclear is actually
the one.
That.
Per unit of energy produced so I
would just leave the committee
that chair representative thank
you thank you Representative
Representative.
Clean and Senator.
I just want to thank you for
bringing this bill forward
earlier
in the debate that discussion a
thought scared me.
That a disposal facilities with
a repository in may interests
are tribal reservations or
pueblos in our nation status is
scared off to the.
And I would hope that our tribal
leaders and elders and community
members would be wise enough not
to entertain.
Anything near that soft also I
don't impose economic
development I don't oppose
making living and working but
not at the cost of our
likelihood.
First hand I know first hand.
By first hand knowledge.
Senator two hundred rating still
July July sixteenth nineteen
seventy nine.
Knighted nuclear cooperation
statements.
Previous.
And reach the stamp I was there
I was a little girl.
So that accident remains the
largest release of radioactive
material in the United States
history.
And.
That has affected our livelihood
in every way.
Air water land livelihood
livestock children grandchildren
great grandchildren everything
our livelihood before that my
grandparents made a good living
they were they were wealthy they
have farms has grants they were
independent they were self
sufficient they let the good
life of Intel expand.
So at the cost of likelihood
it said every day I to the
state.
So.
With that I want to thank you
for bringing this bill forward I
would prefer to use my I would
not for to use tax dollars to
clean up.
Still I'm just.
So thank you for bringing this
bill forward committee members

Eighty Representative.
Get started again.
The fighters thank you for
getting started.
The madam chair members of the
house bill four eighty six but
as part of an ongoing effort to
modernize our state department
kingfish.
If this in the part of the the
biggest day on forcing the
district the fact.
We're talking about the
information and have to make
European Commission.
more stable and I come from the
special.
In this bill is focused on the
department itself the king
Commission The chart.
Wildlife is incredibly important
to the state of New Mexico and
it's residents of we have a
vibrant hunting and fishing
district and we want to make
sure that states would lose
beyond hunting and fishing and
we have the privilege to burst
right of wildlife here in New
Mexico as my colleague
Representative small this remind
me of the for fifth I just the
by the.
In that
well if it is something that.
It is always something I enjoyed
it's something that people
travel from from a great
distance.
To come see him come experience
from the part and what we're
we're hopeful do is to.
Get our department if you fish
and get them thinking more for
the future
but I will I would example I
often see above and I talk about
the high part.
Hi we department of the
department of transportation
because that's the first of all
and it needed to look at things
more than just I I think I think
we're past time for for making
fish to look at wildlife
biologist.
Fish and the to expand that
economic development
opportunities for New Mexico.
This bill is essentially in two
parts the first part is changing
and the mission of the
department and I recognize we
have representatives from
farming here today at expect
we'll hear from them
it's something I I've I would
characterize as something the
the real.
but something that we've been
pushing for for them to move
forward.
The other part of the bill is
coming.
Fees which I which I hope
they're all dressed this is
something they've asked for
there is a column Senate bills
it's just on.
To increase fees they have
operation for this covering many
for their
fishing operations.
We just we package those
together in the speech.
That would be happy to answer
any questions I know
Representative small would also
like to see if you thank you
very much madam chair of the
committee I'm very pleased to be
here madam chair and committee
house bill forty six is exactly
as chairman queen is described
madam chair committee my own
history is one bank shared with
many many New Mexicans and
that's hunting and fishing from
a very early age my earliest
memories with my grandfather
before I was went through hunter
safety where I got a ninety
eight to pull off my brother.
Is that the.
were we're going your hunting
with my grandfather and my
uncles when I was old enough to
the passenger safety so many
memories are of harvest.
Also chair in committee as
somebody who's privilege to get
to see different parts of the
state our wildlife diversity our
natural heritage for those who
are not hunting whether it's not
the season or they just on time
is down we are the fifth most
biodiverse state in the country.
As chairman claim this the folks
come here for the diversity of
our wildlife and folks growth
here their entire lives and they
may not go for fish and they are
they benefit from our state's
wildlife diversity
chair and committee this bill is
permissive it gives the current
structure the what the
Commission the ability to choose
to manage wildlife species and
modernizes while also in trying
our hunting heritage it also
modernizes and slightly widens
the.
Madam chair committee this is
been a years long effort at many
junctures we have heard that
resources are a core limited in
the core barrier to this sort of
changes that are being sought
here which are again frankly
given the department more
permission
more than anything and madam
chair committee I think we're
proud to say that this year
there are additional funding
sources there's two million
dollars in house bill two more
modernization and force the
Senate race conservation mean
there is other legislation is
passed the Senate bipartisan
support that will bring a yearly
some to the game and fish
department and madam chair
committee is chair with we
talked about there is a decrease
in fees for me as a hunter and
fisherman and force thousands of
other New Mexicans of thousands
of folks from outside our state
want to come in either hunt or
fish so in all cases there will
be additional funding for the
department
in this is a key opportunity if
the department wishes to
take on a little bit more in
terms of modernization if they
want to do some simple name
change pieces and have the
decision
at the commission to manage
wildlife species then this is a
unique opportunity for them to
do so and I'm pleased to be here
with you today thank you for
your time.
Thank you.
Go to the audience for comics
and supported bill.
Hello Hey.
Comments within one minute.
Thank you for being here today
thank you for this was our
opinions also but is it the road
ride from home so the county
years citizens have a.
I'm here in support of the bill
currently most of our wildlife
lost are a hundred years old and
no longer serve wildlife
produces State I also fully
support I needed for funding for
the department to our general
fund and other eight in the
spirit of fairness we are
overdue for an overhaul of this
agency so that also you she's
gonna have fair representation
and support please move this
bill forward it is high time for
the department of game fish your
the rest of us in the twenty
first century.
Madam chair members the lines
from Bernalillo and selfless
program director for defenders
of wildlife we had a thousand
members here in the state of New
Mexico the mostly non
consumptive wildlife use the
words they're mostly wildlife
watchers enjoyed having wanted
landscape enjoyed going while it
is here as you've heard our
statutes to wirelessly using our
integrated the game with the
start of does a very good job
with the money they have to rest
of their mission a half now but
we think it's really important
we catch up with other western
states and expand that mission
to other while we're in the
middle of the fibers Crisis
we're losing species and while
it faster than ever before in
human history and to have our
our state department.
Resources and the mission field
that I personally use a special
participate thank you for.
Further comment from the
audience and.
Webcast.
Kevin Biggs B. go ahead.
Yes thank you madam chair
members of the committee my name
is Kevin Bixby executive
director of the nonprofit
wildlife for all based in Los
crucis and in my capacity
With that organization I study
the wildlife management
It all is that what the wildlife
management systems in place in
all the states I want to point
out that New Mexico is an out
liar in that over the years the
legislature has only delegated
authority to the department and
the game commission to manage a
subset of the many wildlife
species in the state that works
out to an average of about sixty
percent of our vertebrate
species so the other forty
percent are the department does
not have authority to manage and
cannot step in to protect those
species that there's a problem
and that
that percentage varies by the
taxonomically for mammals it's
only twenty percent so most of
our mammalian species in the
state are sort of in a no man's
land where our state wildlife
agency does not have the legal
authority to step in to protect
those species thank you can go
we support this bill that would
it would remedy that situation
thank you thank you Jessica
Johnson.
Good afternoon madam chair
committee members Jessica
Johnson with animal protection
voters we support this bill as
it increases license fees to
meet modern needs it
simultaneously brings the
department's name mission and
overarching policy to meet
modern times as well and to be
more reflective of the general
public's interest in healthy
diverse wildlife populations we
believe that because of that it
also sets a strong foundation
for the department to pursue
funding for its work from the
general public including from
the federal government as
federal legislation comes to
pass so we urge your support
thank you so much thank you just
because genco and go ahead.
Can you get.
Yes we can.
Okay great thank you my name is
Dan Colin and I am a New Mexico
educator wildlife is a publicly
shared resource held in trust
for all citizens the New Mexico
department of game and fish is
an update I have followed its
management decision for over
thirty years it needs a
comprehensive scientifically
waited makeover in favor of
biodiversity.
Model which by design
understands the value of all
was like species for maintaining
healthy and balanced ecosystems
hunting and fishing is included
in this model which should never
be the only determinant for
conservation decisions or
policy.
With increasing decline in
wildlife populations and species
due to climate change and
drought the New Mexico
department of game and fish
needs to be modernized to
reflect these changes let New
Mexico have the foresight to
manage wildlife Wimbledon strong
future thank you to the Sanchez
please vote yes for H. B. four
eighty six thank you yes Charles
box your next go ahead.
Yes thank you madam chair and
committee members my name is
Charles fox and with Santa Fe
New Mexico
I do support this bill but there
are some things that.
That troubling about state
wildlife management currently
became department generates most
of its revenue from selling the
public's wildlife for
consumptive use but the vast
majority of New Mexicans who do
not how to fish are allowed
little to no meaningful
participation in their wildlife
policy I think this lack of
inclusiveness and accountability
creates a crisis of legitimacy
for state wildlife management
although I think more should be
done to increase began
departments accountability to
the people of New Mexico this
bill does contain some necessary
provisions for modernizing state
wildlife management I asked that
the committee support this bill
thank you thank you Charles
foster Simpson go ahead.
Thank you Mr chairman members
the committee Oscar Simpson
former game commissioner
lifelong sportsmen fishermen
outdoorsmen photographer.
Back but back to our.
The key thing is the game
department based on my forty
years of monitoring the gain
Department The came to mission
needs to be modernized.
This bill fills that task will
certainly help stabilize the
game commission for making good
decisions in the future I our
need to support house bill forty
six thank you.
Thank you all for your Margaret
bell go ahead.
Madam madam chair members of the
committee my name is Margaret
fail I live in Albuquerque and
I'm speaking in support of house
bill four eighty six I strongly
support modernised modernisation
of the game and fish department
to change its name and expand
its mission beyond hunting and
fishing I also support
increasing license fees to
provide the rest Representative
revenues necessary for these
changes please vote yes on house
bill forty six thank you thank
you Margaret.
The five seven five number go
ahead.
Hello.
Hello Committee can you hear me
alright yes we can.
Thank you and good afternoon I'm
Mary Catherine ray wildlife
chair for the Rio Grande chapter
of the Sierra Club I live in the
outback and Sikora county
wildlife conservation is
important to Sierra Club and is
personally important to me as a
wildlife enthusiast and
photographer statute that
established the department of
game and fish are a century old
and woefully out of date state
our wildlife the so many threats
falling from the sky that are
succumbing to novel disease
insect populations are
plummeting and ecosystems are at
risk of unraveling HB four
eighty six will give our state
wildlife agencies with the
ability to focus beyond just
kill a whole game it can become
a true color conservation so I
urge that you vote yes I need to
be forty six thank you thank
you.
All righty let's go to the
audience for comments in
opposition to the bill.
Madam chair representative is
this I stand today in opposition
to this bill we don't disagree
that modernizing the department
and the commission is working
eight aspirational goal cannot
support the bill with broad
based.
Funding to support the proposed
expansion of mission in this
bill as you know conservation is
a long term undertaking
requiring more than one two or
even four years of funding.
Senator Haidar recognize this
recently cosponsored Federal
those with generated twenty
seven million dollars per year
to support species of greatest
conservation needs unfortunately
this perpetual funding sources
in the last week of December
about starting new property
Senator hundreds recovering
America's wildlife act the
transformational support the
proposed expansion this bill
again unfortunately the timing
is not work this bill is
premature.
What the conservation act which
is currently in statute
recognizes the need for this
broad based funding what it says
that funding for a parent
species uses a strange
conservation need to come from
sources separate and apart the
game protection fund as you can
see in the committee FIR the
intent of this bill is to expand
the use of hunter and angler
licensees to support species of
greatest conservation need not
to bring another I.
I would know that we have a
broadly supported the Senate
will provide additional funding
through a license being this
bill for five of funding and
aquifers leader of the wildlife
federation as well as
organizations like autumn.
That recognize the breadth of
one of the conservation of the
department doesn't irritate and
support.
We cannot support the bill today
if you have monsters in the
interim the bill that has
perpetual funding to addresses
all concerns thank you.
Good afternoon members of the
committee care Mero executive
director is this for the New
Mexico council of outfitters and
guides we do stand opposed to
this bill but I want to say as
an advocate for the hunting
industry we are I have we're not
opposed to the conservation of
the species we're very much in
support of conservation for the
benefit of all species and the
recovering America's wildlife
act had passed Congress we would
be having a much different
conversation here today but it
did not pass and individually to
continue I think we're forced to
fund their agency efforts which
is why our organization is in
support of the officiating
priests bill is currently moving
through the Senate in addition
needs to increase the revenue
simply remain solvent this bill
includes the feeding increase
which from Senate bill fifty
four however additional also
significantly expands
apartments.
And responsibilities and it
fails to indicate how this is
going to obtain an additional
twenty five million dollars per
year in order to pay for their
standard for cancer right and to
re branding agency this bill is
unfortunately a very expensive
unfunded mandate fish thank you
madam any further comments in
opposition to the bill in the
audience seeing that let's go to
the webcast.
Branding when go ahead and.
Yes hi madam chair this right
away and I live in Albuquerque
New Mexico and I've been done
the strong support of the
department game and fish
And I wholeheartedly agree with
some of the other comments from
everybody saying that we need to
modernize the mission of the
department but unfortunately H.
B. up forty six at all due
respect to the sponsors and all
supporters is the as a poor
approach and people brought up
it's not funded if Ralph had
passed I would be having like a
vibrant Care Romero just said a
different conversation right now
it adds too many
responsibilities and and these
are not permissive these are
mandated these are costs the
Department get efficient budget
is is fifty million dollars the
budget in Arizona for their way
of wildlife is Utah Sir HSD the
hundred million dollars and
additional funding that was
spoke to is pennies compared to
that I mean it will push is over
sixty million the money's not
there and so it's premature now
also there's this implication in
the bill the the department
budget doesn't manage the non
game species that's just not
true I mean they manage black
but it bears pine martens river
otters Jr called leopard brought
to the job to the monsters
States bats non game birds they
have dedicated biologist right
now on staff that work on this
very hard and very good at their
job so I would just like to say
that I love the concept and I'm
wholeheartedly in favor of the
concept this bill but it's just
not funded you know so I just
see that the management of all
of hundred and one hundred came
with decrease because of the new
mandates with reporting and
stuff at the park would have to
do it be taking people out of
the field and put in the office
writing reports for species that
they don't have the numbers that
they have put those port reports
it's just that it's a fiscal
nightmare here so I would
encourage you to please not pass
this bill thank you very much.
To go ahead.
Madam chair and members of the
committee thank you for the
opportunity to comment this
afternoon my name is Tiffany
Rivera with New Mexico farm and
livestock bureau we respectfully
stand in opposition this
afternoon but not because we
oppose the modernization of the
department but because the
proposal before you today will
place an extreme burden on our
department we encourage the
legislature to continue to work
with the department on an
approach to modernization that
they will be able to fully
implement and have the resources
to do so our state's
agricultural producers continue
to face challenges with wildlife
particularly LFC in the northern
part of the state and we believe
that broadening the department
scoping mission will reduce the
time and effort spent on
management currently under their
jurisdiction for these reasons
we do Senate respectful
opposition thank you.
All right thank you committee
members Representative lock
thank you madam chair thank you
Representative I will be quicker
than the last bill on this one.
So I've just been reading the
health.
And it says according to.
The.
Department.
It would cost about thirty six
million dollars annually what's
currently appropriated house
bill two for this department
Madam chair representative thank
you madam chair thank you the
in house bill two there is two
million dollars special
appropriation in other
legislation there is anywhere
from ten to probably for twelve
million dollars including the
fees Madam chair representative
I think it's very important that
we right now
there's been a service this at
different modernization efforts
of happened over the course of
several year period in that
several year period the
department has inflated costs
for things like the name change
they are very.
Here the.
And I'm happy to get that for
committee members.
in order to sort of ascertain
perhaps the true cost chair
representative for the
the legislation this allows the
game and fish department to
manage other wildlife it does
not require them to nor does it
specify in this wild life for
them.
Chair of the
some of the some of the
objections we heard I think
possibly grief for a small set
about with your cell insulated
us and this is in the service
chicken or egg situation where
well we're not we're not funding
them to do the other things but
yes you can which which was
first so one of the things we
put into this bill is a delayed
effective date that doesn't
figure first into July first
twenty twenty four
to the to assist time to plan
and figure out what exactly we
need to do and make sure they're
funded.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you Representative.
So what do you think the real
cost in your estimate since the
address maybe what is it
overestimated by seventeen
Representative think they madam
chair thank you Representative
for the name change which is
sort of the most substantive are
Madam chair representative we
think for the delay
implementation and that is not a
requirement to change everything
all at once that the two million
dollars is a very strong start.
Okay thank you madam chair
representative and then my other
question is just a simple one
you know the still seventy
pages.
I I read a bill a couple years
ago that was like three hundred
fifty pages what happens between
a couple years ago today Madam.
Madam chair of the board create
that point one of the things we
did was make a change in the by
reference which shows actually
the conversation with the
council service I really like
doing that but I do want to
three individuals and so a lot
of the references to.
For the commission for fans in
chapter seventeen do we have
language that we're years and
seventeen it should be
interpreted as the the new
Right thank you madam chair
thank you Representative bye for
cell.
Representative and
Representative Zamora madam
chair and up Representative is.
I would I would note that
there's Senator wrong with this
of the FIR is one way to start
co mingling the
Gosh I forgot the name of the
money that the that is going to
be Roberts said of the match
when you start co mingling that
then you may not get the federal
match is under the federal
agreement.
I see that this will need a lot
of person to go ahead and manage
all the other of all the species
I would go for game and fish
that when you look at of.
the early nineteen hundreds.
There were basically no welcomed
New Mexico.
And now there's bonded so
they'll
I would note that the Turkey
populations for low by the by
the seventies now there's
Turkey's populations are quite
important for the in fact we
have one Turkey down buddy
buddy.
Your areas that just came off
the endangered list so I think
the game and fish department is
doing a good job at one is
directed to this I think you
need to go over maybe the
environmental Department and put
those people over there or
something but I just can't
support the way it is for thank
you madam chair thank you
Representative Zamora and and
Representative Chasey madam
chair I move to table with the
next page.
Representative Chasey will go
back to that.
Thank you madam chair so
disturbed by.
I heard that.
A lot of.
About the fact that there's no
money in the needed explain
there's money and a delayed
implementation.
M..
I believe I understand there is
some increases in the fees in
this.
Legislation as well it the more
right madam chair for the first
that just as messed madam chair
and and madam for later we have
included the fee increases we
are I want to however madam
chair settlement for the reader
the that those fees are
intended that is came protection
money used for us is purposes
this is a I think basically and
easier way to sort of combine to
approach to concept the game
protection money wasn't
necessarily go for any of the
other funding needs share in the
metaphor leader there in
addition to the money that's and
house bill two there is another
piece of Senate legislation that
has come over to the house which
sets aside a trust fund of which
New Mexico game and fish
department is one of the
benefits.
we're dition of funding would be
available and your point madam
chairman for leader about this
being permissive is very
important because the game and
fish department gets to choose
with the director and with the
commission that remember the
governor appoints.
And what additional species they
want to take any additional
responsibilities for this does
not force them to choose a
single one.
Is.
This is false is that the right
in the because comments
including what we heard from
director Sloan the the few
creases are not being tended to
cover the the expanded mission
that the money will have to come
from elsewhere and we're working
on that we have some of the
money in the pipeline that there
would be more coming it also
released the Robertson money
that percent bring reference
like in almost any state agency
I mentioned you know they have
different funds in different
sources of funds that have
certain restrictions then there
would be accounting to just be
done to make sure those funds
remain separate.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you Representative

I've heard is that you have.
Notwithstanding the failure of
the Senator hundred still to
make it over the finish line by

Thank you madam chair a very
controversial bill that you guys
are used to.
It's house bill four sixty six
this is a.
Bill that deals with the ethics
commission.
there is an amendment the
imposed and I believe hopefully
and just going to hand out the
minutes.
For for sixty six.
Madam chair rather handing out
the.
Who do I.
Two two five four nine one point
two.
The.
What is that.
For.
To discuss this I have a second
Milwaukee's Isshin these seven
Madam chair of the the amendment
to the results of collaboration
with former representative they
were going to be realized
The velvet section to expand the
role not contracted the role of
the ethics commission so we are
striking all of section two that
begins on page one line twenty
one through page two line twenty
one.
The second thing it does it
changes the.
Four eight through
the term.
Four lines seventeen eighteen
and nineteen
initially we thought that that
Should be two commissioners and
a hearing officer but upon.
Consultation with some of the
commissioners date about that
They did not want to be in the
loop and so and independent
hearing officer would be the
only one that would terminate.
Probable cause in the term
whether or not the the issue
moves forward and then there's
one other will fix on page five
line I strive to work
ministers make consistent with
the rate for one seventy eight
so that's the gaps of the
remember.
Then I can explain the bill if
you would like for them to deal
with the amendment act.
The bill.
Whatever pledge of the
committee.
For discussion.
I have a question.
Okay okay Madam chair
representative divers.
So I did hear from the chair of
the commission and
There is concern that they want
to do in that role that that
kind of investigating and
determining probable cause and
so forth so your amendment takes
care of that concern.
And
By striking all of section two.
Some mail about not wanting to
limit the ethics commission does
this limit the FMX Commission
your your remains the status quo
status quo.
Because you were actually
expanding what are what are
intense
was interpreted.
Full service occasion apparently
did find some expansion of the
status of.
Okay.
Thank you madam chair.
The men and women motion to
adaptive equipment fire seven
o'clock said in the second I
don't see the opposition you
have an amended bill.
Thank you madam chair house bill
four sixty six out as amended
sexually it does one thing.
If removes the executive
director.
Of general counsel from the law
determining probable causes
whether efforts investigation
should be for other purposes and
it's in lieu of the
general counsel it replaces that
person with an independent
hearing officer to make that
determination so that was the
substance of the bill
I can tell you that
When we originally drafted this
couple years ago we thought that
the general counsel would be the
one to make that I think you're
of the services that may have
not been a wise decision lost
alright and because the general
council service.
As the prosecutor if you will of
the movement of the ethics
investigation for so after that
first to determine whether or
not the issue should be moved on
further with being made by the
very person who would be
involved in that issue and so
we're trying to put a little
separation between the decision
making on.
Whether or not probable cause
exists to move the matter
forward and taking it out.
So with that person for
questions okay we'll do the
audience not yet it's Saturday
off.
Audience for public comment in
support of the bill please raise
your hand.
Sir.
Thank you madam chair.
After a Mexico state ethics
commission.
I believe this bill the the
replacement of the general
counsel all come to termination
to an independent hearing
officer over the decades to come
one research and see if state at
this stage I think it's a good
move
I think it will also protect the
internet stuff from undue
criticism from decisions that
it's their job to pursue cases
that that they pursuant in the
in the closet judicial role of
the commission it pains me are
turning staff as judge subjected
to criticism for doing their job
they're excellent attorneys
there in part.
And and I think this this bill
will fix that problem as well
and independents a hearing
officer what I take that to me
is that officer can be staff the
commission and madam chair I
just hired hearing this stuff
all of our hearing officers are
under contract and I think
caught a following that decision
for future executive director in
the in the years to come this is
a good idea as well so I support
this thank you
madam chair further comment
since the Persian Gulf madam
chair members of the committee
my name is Judy was
Representative Harper Mexico for
several years we have worked
very diligently to to to.
Is your passage of the US state
of this commission and to work
out strong and it provided

For the comments in support of
the bill

Kunkle go ahead.
Thank you and good afternoon
madam chair members of the
committee Shannon Kunkle
speaking on behalf of common
cause New Mexico we want to
thank the sponsor for the
amendment to remove the and
Valory commissioners from the
probable cause determination
which has resolved our most
pressing concerns about the
legislation and the creation of
the state ethics commission was
the culmination of decades of
bipartisan work by lawmakers and
advocates to ensure a fair and
transparent process for handling
ethics complaints in twenty
eighteen it was approved by more
than seventy five percent of
voters receiving nearly half a
million votes in favor of
establishing this commission
while we certainly understand
the need to fine tune as easy
procedures from time to time we
would urge that the legislature
avoid the practice of making
changes to the commission in
response to any single rulings
are findings and we just thank
you for the work that's gone
into this bill on the amendment
and we're taking care to ensure
that our ethics commission
remains strong and independent.
Thank you Shannon Damon go
ahead.
On muted I'm still going to work

chair thank you for the.
Thanks.
Questions.
This.
Okay.
Thank you madam chair thank you
for their.
But what you know this bill
right he went through this I I
respect your memories and your
intelligence and everybody has
like from.
On this bill my mic which is
basically.
If you're satisfied with twenty
five percent turnout in primary
elections
so then this bill isn't for you
honestly but if you're not think
it's fine it really not
acceptable primary elections are
more important than any you know
these days anytime previous
given that lack of competitive
districts
I I don't understand what you
know what's wrong with having
people of of we have this huge
massive independent voters click
three hundred thousand more than
that in New Mexico it's not like
they're disengaged not like
watching football tournaments on
TV they're actually like really
engaged and they want to
participate and for those that
are concerned about oh my god
this is going to be in the
budgets of points from the other
party is come in and you know
it's I just honestly I don't
think the data supports that
it's important it makes a
difference in participation and
that's why this bill is here and
and you know all the arguments
pro and con and I respect
everybody's opinion pro and con
so
here today was silent
cited
after so.
with a vote elections and we
also have live.
Some of the secretary of state's
office to answer questions but
and and you know still so there
you go thank you.
Of what's got the audience do we
have this is part of the bill.
Right please.
Make your state.
Everyone my name is Leslie
oxygen I am the director of
legislative affairs for the
secretary's office secretary
information and from the
community
this bill before so you guys are
seeing it again today and that
is that this bill represents
another step forward something
that we're already doing right
so currently Miller for process
when someone who is not
affiliated with a major party
shows up at a polling location
on election day very primary
election early voting they're
given the opportunity to re
register at the application of
the participate in the election
there they've picked a major
party right the people in
involved in that lane production
that registration stays with
them it does not resolve process
with a super this would
eliminate that stuff independent
and major party orders would be
able to take away without
permanently changing there are
restrictions so what are being
sent to prison for that this
thank you.
Madam chair members of the
committee I have a growing
president of the league of women
voters of New Mexico the league
supports the right of every
citizen to vote and we also
support.
Methods increasing voter
participation including systems
including the laugh every voter
to the primary elections thank
you.
If I can discover things by the
way you know the taxpayer pays
for primary elections small
detail you know it's funded by
our tax payers not printed
product party Republican Party
that also.
You know people just think this
is senator may I finish public
comment we have a
yeah so let's go to the west.
Share this article go ahead.
Thank you hello again madam
chair members of the committee
and first I want to thank the
sponsor for this bill and echo
you know the point that was just
made about these being taxpayer
funded elections for far too
long unaffiliated and minor
party voters have been excluded
from the primary process which
poses a growing problem because
more and more voters do choose
to register as DTS and many of
our elections are actually
decided in the primary because
there's frequently a lack of
competition in the general
election so we believe this bill
will help boost voter
participation and turnout in the
primaries and more fully engage
New Mexicans in the process so
we are to do pass thank you
thank you Shannon Kandace Brower
go ahead.
Hello can you hear me yes.
Madam chair and members of the
committee my name is Candace
Brower and I'm an independent
voter and resident of
Albuquerque who supports SB
seventy three.
Weeks ago I heard members of the
house Judiciary Committee
expressed concerns that the
parallel bill H. B. fifty four
would unduly burden candidates
were already stretched thin in
having to extend their outreach
to independent voters although I
am sympathetic to their concerns
I would like to point out that
they have an easy way to reach
independent voters without
spending any money and only a
little bit of time by filling
out the questionnaires provided
by online sites like ballotpedia
invoke smart that allow
candidates to describe their
qualifications and stances on
issues that voters care about
independent voters prefer to
vote for candidates not pardons.
And that voter myself I am
grateful to have access to the
information provided by
ballotpedia New Mexico smart
when I and my sample ballot
before going to the polls and
much more likely to vote for a
candidate who is gone to the
trouble to provide this
information online thank you for
your consideration thank you
can this Susan Kelly go ahead.
Thank you.
Chairman there's always more
interesting a Bernalillo county
and I fully support this bill
for all of the reasons that a
been spared no doubt Senator
annual has worked for him and
House Judiciary.
You to do.
Thank you.
Thank you Susan encouraging your
go ahead.
Good afternoon thank you madam
chair members the committee says
Kurt right here with the
traffic's ministry of New Mexico
speaking also this afternoon for
the New Mexico parts of church
the press to Santa Fe.
We do believe that I think
participation and senator Neil
the state is the key and we
believe the political health of
our nation suffers when voters
are excluded from elections and
we believe the closed primaries
do indeed exclude vast numbers
of voters from the yes so will
simply leave it at that rules we
support the the bill for all the
reasons previously stated urge
your support as well the seventy
three thanks for the opportunity
thank you Kurt.
All right sorry.
Of public comment in opposition
of the bill seeing an and we
have one Madam chair of the
webcast Stuart Ingle go ahead.
Thank you I.
I know this.
Would promote more participation
but it would mute the parties
affected ness and.
Choosing a candidate for their
for their party and the people
that have
I don't choose to affiliate with
a party.
Really shouldn't have a boat in
that party if they would like to
have a vote this they have
opportunities to change our boat
I I would ask the committee to
not just this bill thank you.
Thank you all right committee
members.
Representative on in new more.
Well
Saturday.
Okay and Representative is in
you I've talked about this bill
and we talked about this very
issue this committee before so I
won't.
Re hash you know some of the
issues that I've brought up
before so present when I do want
to discuss that I'm still very
concerned about is
constitutionality issues that I
think we might be facing here
because we look at states like
California and I live the state
that has of the primaries but
what I think we need to really
highlight and underscore is that
California's originally tried to
pass what we are trying to pass
in this bill and that got struck
down by the Supreme Court for
freedom Association issues their
grounds rather
insulin health warning in
because this language got struck
down by the Supreme Court they
didn't the then adopted what is
an open primary like the model
The Washington so Washington has
a primary where there just are
no parties really and the top
two vote getters move on to the
general regardless this is the
part of town Senator.
Can you tell me Madam.
What differentiates this bill
from what California tried to do
and.
Why are you confident that we
will not be met with lawsuits at
the end if I can the store and
madam chair and.
Representative before silence
speaks to this
this was definitely the focus in
our Judiciary Committee and I
you know and what's the
difference in their Senate
committee reports Hey you know
but the thing is this is
happening all throughout this
you know that's specific to
California that is very specific
California we can on our side
and other states where it hasn't
been a constitutionality issue
and then I just sat through your
wonderful hall tech
you know they'll and and yeah
let's look into the future is
the spring park out of whatever
fill in the blank you know.
It's so you know I just think
there's reasons there are many
reasons to counteract that very
valid concern and you bring up I
mean we really do you know
really look at that and I'm just
confident in my internet
colleagues and the dishes area
you know they basically it's
very overwhelming of.
So I just that doesn't seem to
concerned other
legal professionals that I
respect not all of the protect
but the person that you know.
Anyway we will okay yes but we
love our Senate committee.
Major analysts by the way they
do that so what is this.
Senator handout for supporting
the five.
you can silence.
Leveraging shared with.
Just assisting question what we
are missing today compared to
the California bills that was
deemed unconstitutional
what California proposed was
allowing all parties affiliated
regardless of their party to
pick and choose either about so
that would mean a registered
Democrat could pick and choose
the Republican primary and both
in that which was
unconstitutional as.
The first amendment that is not
what we are forcing for offering
saviors offers and that is not
what we are offering today with
this bill what this bill would
only allow is independent and
minor party registry.
Voters to pick and choose either
the democratic or Republican
about so that is not
unconstitutional.
In fact forty one different
states have it across our
country so that was a
constitutional here it would be
a constitutional forty other
states so that's what we are you
know asking of you guys today
just to be able to consider yes
today independent voters we
register and then we register
themselves again which could
take months sometimes so all
we're asking you just live that
created an a lot will change for
for justification for
installation thank you madam
chair at.
Representative and Sullivan.
