as we get organized thank you
Representative Eli.
We're getting this straightened
out.

He's logging on right now.
Representative Matthews are we
about ready.
I hope so we're straightening
out some mechanics that are in
straight out last night I'm
projects.
I believe that that.
Your we also need I I believe
that the PS secretary station
Boeing has not been brought
over.
Could we do that please.
Well.
All.
And I believe now that we have
at deputy commander.
parts not on has he been brought
over.
Now.
And then did you say W. hard dog

Again I apologize that.
This got so complicated.
Okay Representative are we ready
to begin.
Yes madam chair and vice chair
we are ready to begin and I
just so I could.
Recently introduced the
Experts today would that be
alright with you.
Yes Representative.
I'm sorry.
Madam chair we can't hear you
and we can barely hear
Representative Matthews and I'm
not really clear why we're
calling experts since we had
that yesterday are we going to
re open for questions.
nine my understanding is that
there were some analyst you had
not asked questions yet.
What that means Madam chair of
create that from the.
sponsor but I want to know from
the chair since we're gonna have
experts I'm assuming we're going
to re open it to questions from
all the panelists that just
seems fair to me that if we're
going to have again a
presentation experts which
really is not something we
ordinarily do we did that face
we went to public comment now we
want to panelists were almost
done I thought we were going
right to the voter we were going
to hear from Representative
Matthews.
Given the concerns the committee
that we were going to have a new
bill or substitute bill I guess
that's not gonna happen but I'm
not clear why we're going to
experts again and if we are I
would certainly like the
opportunity to ask them
questions and go through the
same line of questioning I did
the other day I just think
that's only fair.
And madam chair
I believe the only person where
we were in proceedings the other
day was it the only person who
had asked questions was
Representative Eli and he has
questions forced quite some time
and I don't believe that the
other that there were several of
the other panelists to I I
Christina or tickets I think
Representative Ortez did just
some questions but I'm not sure
that
of all the
My understanding was that there
were still some Representative
Representative trouble excuse
me.
Excuse me
it that there were several of
the representatives who had not
had an opportunity yet to ask
questions including of matter
vice chair yourself.
Good morning everyone again yes
people can ask questions except
for the we will not have we will
not entertain public comment.
Thank you for Representative
Okay you may continue madam
chair I I do have a point of
order.
State your point.
Are you but Canadian rules do
not limit.
Questioning of committee members
to one round and so
Representative Ely and many
other committee member should be
allowed to ask additional
questions if they so wish and I
would certainly like to do that
because all I've stated was that
I have some constitutional
concerns I did not ask any
questions thank you madam chair.
Thank you Representative.
Representative Matthews.
Madam chair
I agree actually Representative
Nibert because I think we were
in the middle of the questioning
I don't know what you're
committee rules are as to the
people who have already asked
questions asking questions again
Ezzell I'm I defer to the
committee on that but I think
that we were in the process of.
The committee asking questions
and
And that's what that's what I
thought we were going to proceed
with today Representative so at
this point we will continue with
questions however no comments
from the public so let's move
forward with our questions thank
you Representative okay and and
madam chair may I at this point
Jennifer hi my experts and as
who they are so that to.
So that the committee members
will have that information.
Thank you.
Thank.
I'm we have today basically some
of the questions that were asked
last time we have
APD deputy commander called out
Hartzog who is in charge of the
homicide unit in Albuquerque.
I believe chief Medina may also
be available
we have at awful Mendez who is
chief of policy and planning for
the second judicial district
we have more Keller of as
America Albuquerque it is
charge of the police force and.
Just a deal on a daily basis
with the problems of crime in
the city we have DPS secretary
Jason Bailey and
One eight five eight I believe
that is the list at this point
thank you.
Thank you madam Representative
and committee members I have
Representative Nibert.
Thank you madam chair
I guess based on our.
What I understood the in the
last meeting as a there was
going to be an opportunity to
maybe look at some of the
comments and concerns that were
raised and maybe tweak it looks
to me like we are left with the
bill as presented that there's
been no
amendments were substitution
debate and so to clarify my
first question madam chair it is
my understanding of the status
of this legislation correct.
Madam chair
members of the committee
Representative Nibert you in
Iran Senator discussions and
fact I emailed you again last
night about the possibility of
looking at some changes but
given the shortness of time
we have not of actually decided
on some of those it it seems to
me that rather than trying to
tweak language at this point we
needed to
get those through this hearing
we think that the.
In presented bill and move
forward.
As we move toward Judiciary
hopefully that you and I will
continue our discussions as I'm
happy to continue discussions
with any other member
I didn't catch that.
I understood what we're
representative that I sought out
somebody else's talk.
Madam chair as far as I know no
one else was talking okay
Madam chair representative you
set the shortness of time I I do
not believe that this committee
placed any time limits on you're
getting back to us with a
substitute for an amended bill
order a bit confused by by.
That statement I I think and I
would certainly support
this committee
Continuing to hold this pattern
I am for you while you work on
it and hopefully we get it and
eight of get it shored up so
that I believe it's in
A position to move forward you
guys all right as I indicated
earlier I think there are some
significant cost to so issues
that that should be addressed
and so either you do not believe
that those constitutional issues
exist or you want us to barely
passed on the bill as written
which are a.
Have some real concerns with and
if that's the case it certainly
alters by I used for this
legislation and as I've told you
are Madam chair representative I
know we have to do something we
are in a real mess and and I
fully support our the idea that
we need to to address this issue
but I also firmly believe that
we need good legislation we
don't be legislation that's just
going to end up in reports and
white we get overturned due to
constitutional grounds and and
so are yes I'd like your Madam
chair representative your
comment as to whether or not
this bill is ready for prime
time or whether.
You need additional time to work
on it because I'd rather see it
I'd rather see a a good product
moving out of this committee
then just simply moving on are
an issue to Judiciary and and
maybe having the the fix
something more so are your
comments would be appreciated.
Madam chair representative
Nibert thank you
Senator thanks first of all we
do believe that the
The bill is constitutional as
written and I believe in your
conversations in my
conversations I indicated that
I sought out and tried to
determine whether anybody felt
that there was any crime listed
it should not be listed whether
they opposed to any of the
amendment basic structure that
we talked about this statute is
patterned after federal the
federal bill Reform Act of
nineteen eighty four which has
been in place for a very long
time and has and the
constitutionality of which has
been up held time and again and
I'm more than happy to send you
the list of citations from
circuit after circuit and has
not found there to be any
problem with the procedure that
we have put forth in the statute
You you made a proposal to me
last night of four eight eight
nine.
Very substantial change which we
think actually would make the
statute last constitutional the
other thing I would mention is
that the author of the key
opinion this matter is justice
who is now justice Stephen Bryer
just announced that he is
retiring and I terribly
respected.
Juriste and
Well I know that Representative
Ely road to decision differently
than we do we speak to Jessica
decision absolutely supports
what we're doing as to the basis
from Senator circus and the
state of Vermont I believe the
state of Arizona even has a very
similar system and so we're
happy to.
Of find those those references
to this committee I'm happy to
provide up to did you did share
committee prior to the hearing
of but.
We.
And this point at least nobody
is suggested any other than
yourself has suggested that.
Doing this or doing that would
make any difference and at this
point I certainly based on the
federal law and this long
history of cases some of which
are from the United States
Supreme Court we think that this
state statute as written is
constitutional and it's
certainly our intent is to have
a constitutional statute.
Well I saw the news report
correctly I think there's a U.
of M. law professor madam chair
that
are also questions the
constitutionality of of House
Bill five as written but
the other side of I will go
through my concerns with the
constitutional out
constitutional issues but madam
chair before I do that I do need
of the representative to to at
least acknowledge one.
The federal of.
Federal
statute.
Was judged.
Audits constitutional merits
based upon the United States
constitution is that correct.
Madam chair representative
Nibert yes.
And would you agree with me that
the that the New Mexico
prostitution would be the our
constitution by which
this pope potential
bill would be.
Look at in addition to the
United States constitution would
it not.
Madam chair representative
Nibert
eight it I think that it would
be looked at under both yes.
So are you The New Mexico
constitution and its provisions
would be R. an important aspect
to report in judging whether or
not this bill survives
constitutional muster in the
state of New Mexico.
Madam chair representative.
Madam chair representative
Nibert yes but I would note that
the language in the federal
statute and the language in of
the New Mexico constitution are
very very similar.
It.
If I if I might and in fact the
the New Mexico Supreme Court has
specifically.
Rest the similarity and if I
could just very briefly this is
from I'm looking at a summary of
that the AOC put out regarding
the court ruling atores verses
would occur in which the court
said.
The it the recognizes that the
similarity between the language
in the New Mexico constitution
and federal detention statutes
means that I'm not quoting the
court interpretation of our
constitution requirement can
also be informed by how federal
courts have analyzed the same
issue in quote so
Obviously the New Mexico Supreme
Court has already acknowledged
that this body of federal law is
relevant to the interpretation
of our constitutional amendment
thank you.
Thank thank you madam chair and
thank you Representative well.
I'm going to be referring to two
separate
Constitutional provisions one is
article two section thirteen as
it appeared prior to two
thousand sixteen and then the
same section as it appears
currently.
Because I think people need to
understand that.
Change that was made in two
thousand sixteen
Will bear on whether or not this
piece of legislation passes
constitutional muster at least
in my at.
Prior to two thousand sixteen
prior to the constitutional
amendment changing section
thirteen of article two.
We have.
we have provisions the first
paragraph.
Is exactly the same both pre two
thousand sixteen and post two
thousand.
Sixteen.
I did not find one word change
in the first paragraph of that
constitutional secretary of that
constitution section.
Where the changes occur are in
the.
so one paragraphs.
Sh and previously New Mexico in
its constitution set bail may be
done by workers sixty days
By an order entered by the court
and then it goes on and talks
about a defendant accused of a
felony and has previously been
convicted of two or more
felonies with the state are
which the strongest about arise
from the same transaction or
comment transaction we talk
about a defended being accused
of a felony involving the use of
a deadly weapon are felony
conviction with the state and
goes all.
My reading of that language.
Reflects that that language also
appears
in your house bill five it
they're similar language in your
house bill five would you agree
with me on the.
Madam chair representative.
Representative you're on mute.
Madam chair representative
Nibert.
I'm I'm not sure I do agree I
mean I've you're saying that is
word for word I I don't believe
that's accurate.
I did not say it's word for word
said the light we.
What we do here is of the prior.
Constitutional section as
appears in your house bill I.
Very simple right.
I would.
Chair representative Albert I
wouldn't disagree with that in
general.
Yes so so so why are ready
generally was your bill is
basically saying that if you've
been.
It uses certain felonies and
baby have a history of of
That type of conduct.
You're going to be denied of
relates in your bill.
Is that an accurate statement.
Madam chair.
Representative Nibert our bill
does not make the decision about
released the judge district
judge hearing the case makes a
decision always we have not
remove that discretion from the
court.
This is simply a presumption
that the court would look at to
determine whether or not that a
serious offense that occurred or
the other circumstances that are
listed in the statute and but it
would always be up to the
discretion of the district judge
as to whether or not release was
appropriate considering all the
factors that are step toward in
in not in the proposed bill.
In in the bill and which are
totally consistent with the
language of the Supreme Court
the New Mexico Supreme Court
rules there is no effort here to
remove discretion from the judge
in making the ultimate decision.
Madam chair representative yes
more than a presumption is that
because you're not only created
the presumption.
You have the that I think should
approve.
That that that the defendant is.
I think you're.
Two other people in the
community.
So.
What madam chair and and
Representative wanted to explain
what our product base approve
our.
Details for the quarter what it
what it actually means in terms
of for our.
How this will be applied on a
but by George K..
Madam chair representative
Albert I would ask at the Mr
Mendez from the DA's office use
does this bill on our daily
basis and I do to respond to
that.
Thank you Madam chair
representative and
Representative Matthews is it
possible to promote my colleague
James Grayson who's done
extensive research on this point
to have an address these.
Our.
I'm sure I'm I'm I believe this
is a.
More of a in court practical
question then I legal research
question just explained prime a
facie proof and and I
misunderstanding the question I
I think of it would be helpful
to have Mr Grayson join us for
this portion of it
Representative Matthews.
If if that's alright with madam
chair if that's alright with the
chair that's fine.
Go ahead.
Madam.
The committee.
Representative Nibert
thank you for question I think
it's an interesting question so
the question is how does this
work is it does is place the
burden of proof on the defendant
what's a procedural mechanism
here in the federal courts have
dealt with this for the last
forty years Representative Ann
Arbor it is clear and
it yes can be explained in
approximately about a hundred
fifty basis at the federal level
so I understand the research UNM
professor who said suggested
that there's some lack of
constitutionality here suggested
vicious the burden of proof he
clearly has not done his
research on this topic I I have
no
no knowledge of his to his
capabilities entries upon
professor with respect to the
areas about which he knows he
clearly doesn't know about this
area of law.
the federal courts explain that
what happens with this
rebuttable presumption is that
the the
the fact there's all causes an
individual committed the list of
offenses is there sufficient
proof to establish individual
dangerous the conditions of
release cannot protect the
community but it doesn't provide
the judge.
So basically what it does is it
adds the rebuttable presumption
and that is by that I mean it
that's the legislature's
judgment that these are
dangerous this is in dangerous
offenders to the balancing the
factors so the way that this
circuit explained it is there's
a series of weights and measures
and the rebuttable presumption
is one factor that goes into the
bounce.
So it does not it does not to
determine whether the defendant
will be detained it does not
limit the judge's discretion
what project as provide the
defendant with information
excuse me provides the judge
with information about the
legislature's judgment which is
this body has already said that
these offenses are serious
violent offenses so this party
body has already made that
judgment.
What this bill does is it tells
judges that the legislature
things that judgment applies in
the pre trial detention context
as well.
I hope that answers your
question representative Nibert.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you Representative and and
Mister Bryson
madam chair with your permission
may I speak directly to Mr
Gration.
Yes please Representative thank
you madam chair Mr chairman Mr
rations so what does it mean by
shall be a great they should
prove that the defendant is a
danger.
So you have the rebuttable
presumption.
You then have this languages
says.
This chart shopping the product
that you're proven and I'm sorry
I can't remember back forty
years when I was in criminal law
so.
I'm certainly not an expert in
this area of the law but by any
stretch of the imagination but
so what I'm trying to get that
what does that language being
and how is it actually applied
by the judge sitting in the
sitting on the bench as this
defendant comes for.
Madam chair representative
Nibert so.
That's a good question and and I
understand it can be confusing
and its confusing of the just
opinion in terms of justice
briars analysis as well as he
goes through and and explained
Sir and houses it can still be
confusing basically I think the
way to think of it is any any
presumption in criminal law.
is basically treated as a
permissive inference so it can
be used to establish the parties
burden but it doesn't
necessarily establish supported
burden so if we established by
pro will cost of someone
committed first degree murder.
The judge can look at that.
And say okay that first degree
murder charge meets the
rebuttable presumption.
That means the state has
established its burden of proof
now what I need to do is go
through and look at the rest of
the factors that are listed in
the criminal procedure rule and
listed in in the statute as well
such as the defense history
ties to the community the nature
and circumstances of the offense
to determine whether the judge
believes the defendant should be
detained so what the judge can't
say is that the state insurance
insufficient proof but what the
judge can say is that on balance
this defendant should be
released because this defendant
is not a danger to the community
and conditions of race can
protect the community so what we
have right now without these
presumptions as we have judges
saying that even though
defendants charged with first
degree murder the state hasn't
established its burden of proof
that no conditions of release
are available to protect the
community.
And and this rebuttal
presumption would take that
option away from judges and give
act actually judges the
opportunity to make this
balancing without having to
search for basically whether
there's proof to establish the
two elements of a detention so
in other words and just to
summarize
that the rebuttable presumption
is sufficient.
To establish
grounds for detention but it
doesn't necessarily mean that
detention is the result.
In other words it's a permissive
inference.
Madam chair and Mr Grayson are
we keep talking about the
rebuttable presumption I'm
looking at the words I
appropriations proof.
And could you help me get my.
Or remind me.
We're fresh water forty year
recollection as to what product
they should approve the.
Thank you prove madam chair
representative Nibert means that
the party has established a
burden of proof so prime
official proof means for example
let's think of it as a trial
okay the state presents its
evidence at trial
then we have the directed
verdict stage when the judge
must decide based on the state's
proof alone is there enough
evidence to go to the jury then
we have the defendant's case and
then it goes to the jury for the
jury to weigh all of the
evidence so in other words the
prima fashion proof establishes
sufficient
grounds to make at a
determination on the question of
detention if the judge believes
the charge itself.
and the other factors are
sufficient to establish the
state's prove the judge can
detain the judges not forced to
detain so the the words
profession prove representative
Nibert madam chair I don't
change the fact that this is a
rebuttal presumption.
What it does sorry I'm by once
you've done that.
You have made your case and
absent.
Absent something that we're but
Sir.
That is sufficient to.
The time that individual.
So
Whether there are maybe I
haven't lost my mind by tools
are understanding some of those
words that I haven't seen it and
in several decades
let's look at the New Mexico
prostitution because here's the
crux of my constitutional
concert Madam chair
representative.
We're creating a presumption in
your bill.
Yeah.
Article two section thirteen.
We've discussed my hang up on
this before but I'm going to
read that so that everybody
understands what our
constitution says.
And it's the first program.
The first paragraph which was
not changed in two thousand
sixteen.
Article two section thirteen
says all persons shall before
conviction be bailable by
sufficient sureties.
Except for capital offenses.
With the proof is evident or the
presumption great.
And in situations in which dealt
specifically prohibited by this
section.
Then it goes on excessive bail
shall not be required.
When I read that when I read
that first sentence of this
section.
It sets.
Except for capital offenses were
improves is evident or the
presumption great.
Number one madam chair we
established in our prior meeting
that there are no capital
offenses.
In New Mexico today.
Does Madam chairman and Mister
Bryson currently of the other
experts does anyone disagree
with that statement.
Madam chair at Representative
Nibert at we do not disagree
with that statement.
So so there are no capital so
except for capital offenses
which there are no.
When proof is evident or the
presumption great and
Representative bell can be
specifically prohibit that that
wasn't change and and so my
concern is.
The constitution says.
It and my concern is whether or
not.
The presumptions can only be
created with respect to capital
offenses.
Because if presumption is tied
to capital offenses and now we
by legislative fiat are going.
Be on that.
I have a concern because in my
mind.
That would require us to change
the constitution not just by
legislative fiat create
reductions because the federal
government allows present.
Well the federal government's
constitution doesn't have the
work preemption in it anywhere.
But we have presumption in this
very section of our constitution
and it's tied to capital
offenses that is the crux of my
concern on a constitutional
basis and so could someone madam
chair H. Y..
Whether or not.
By reading of the constitution
creates a constitutional issue
and whether or not.
Presumptions should be only
allowed with respect to capital
offenses.
Madam chair representative
Nibert.
The.
The the problem I see in your
analysis is that there's nothing
in that constitutional amendment
it says other presumptions are
disallowed that the legislature
has given up all its ability to
create presumptions by passage
of this amendment and there's
didn't the legislature creates
of presumptions in all kinds of
cases
it and I I'll defer to if if any
of our the experts would like to
expand on that.
Thank you.
he's here and I quite frankly
just second they just sent me a
message that the more would like
to respond to at your statement
if that's okay madam chair.
Representative more Keller I
would like to know what is of.
And legal background gates.
The you're on mute more.
Yeah.
Property for.
Where we can't really hear you
can you speak up a bit thank
you.
The LFC.
I'm.
Give us one second.
Okay have.
That's better thank you.
Okay great.
will listen I really appreciate
that question the opportunity
share a few thoughts on that and
I'm joined here by of course our
chief of police and actually
this room is families of victims
of violent crime as well as all
the leadership in our police
department okay it would just a
briefly I think you know I
understand your question
Representative well All I answer
it.
My apologies for being here
being elected to run the largest
police department in the city
and the state and I'm here with
families I believe that is also
a qualification I represent
families who no longer have
their son.
Their daughters their parents
because of gun violence.
Any member of the public is an
actor.
The question deals with the
constitutional interpretation
and all I ask for what your
qualification to
present as an expert on an issue
involving the constitution
that's that's that's the crux.
And I just gave you the answer
and we're also going to have
some folks may be the who
literally swear on their badge
to protect us and keep us safe
they will also answer your
questions so let me just say
that for us if there are
constitutional questions I
respect that I do I literally
sat in your chair as many of you
know and it's okay we can have
amendment.
The process can happen we can
vote up or down and so whether
or not we get a final resolution
to a constitutional question I
think is not helpful the
following are crime crisis what
helpful for solving our crime
prices is that we take action to
try and stop the revolving door
this might not be perfect I am
not a lawyer and I don't have to
be because I know that we need
help in the metro area and
throughout New Mexico to fight
crime and I know it's also okay
if we disagree but I know this
we always to the families into
our police department to our men
and women who wear that that to
give them some way that they do
not have to rewrite the same
person.
And to provide some have
family to be safe because
someone who has committed a
violent crime with a weapon is
not right back out on the street
because we do know that we re
arrest people over and over and
over and it also costs all the
budgetary funds and resources
that we have challenges with to.
So be it implications are real
and there are lives at stake and
that's why well I respect
constitutional discussion
constitutional questions as part
of the process but I also
respect action and I also
respect the fact that at some
point there is no more excuse
brought to say we are not
helping the largest city in the
state of New Mexico almost half
of our entire population who
screening for the legislature to
help Garcia we're doing
everything we can and we need
your help so that means that
many things later if it means
renewable that's fine we just
need your help and I also want
to let our deputy commander how
hard I speak to this specific
issue because we know we've been
down this road before it's a
thirty day session it's the
first committee and we know how
this ends if we do not act
affect this today
the chief.
Thank you more alert
can we answer and stick to
Representative night birds
question please thank you
madam chair I you are at Mr
Grayson to.
Respond to these questions.
Thank you Representative thank
you madam chair Representative
Nibert it's a good question it's
a good question is for closed by
the New Mexico Supreme Court's
analysis and I'm here.
years two thousand eighteen NMSC
zero three zero in that case the
New Mexico Supreme Court
independently treated that first
sentence that you're talking
about with a capital offense and
the second paragraph which is
bill reform.
So the Supreme Court analyzed
capital offense with respect to
the voters intent in nineteen
twelve.
We're not talking about nineteen
twelve.
And investors ring for
recognizing Amir that the second
paragraph which is the bill
reform paragraph provides much
broader authority for point to
detain the second paragraph says
nothing about whether the
legislature has or does not have
the authority to enact
rebuttable presumptions what we
know from federal law which has
analyzed whether Congress has
that authority we know that this
legislature does have that
authority because the state
legislatures have much broader
authority to protect the general
where welfare and to protect the
safety of the public then even
Congress so if Congress can do
it this legislature absolutely
can do it it's less of a
constitutional issue for this
bill to be passed than it is for
the federal statute to to be
enacted in nineteen eighty four
so that that's the end of the
story with respect to that first
paragraph representative Nibert
no there's still the question of
whether
the the fact that this is in the
constitution can the legislature
and an act of a presumption well
the standard of the voters
adopted in nineteen excuse me
excuse me in two thousand
sixteen is exactly the standard
that's required by the United
States versus Salerno which is
the federal standard it's the
clear and convincing standard
the federal rebuttable
presumption statute is
consistent with Salerno it's
consistent with the due process
clause and so is this bill.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Mr Grayson R. what was that case
that you just referenced I'm
here yes madam chair
representative Nibert it's a
mere A. M. E. R. two thousand
eighteen in M. S. C. zero three
zero and if you look
specifically at paragraph
seventy one the New Mexico
Supreme Court said our district
courts now have a much broader
evidence based attention forty
applicable in both capital and
non capital filling the
nation's.
And the court did not address
whether can be preventable
presumptions under that that
paragraph of article two section
thirteen at all simply was not
part of the opinion and in fact
I'm here would have been decided
differently.
with the interpretation you have
ascribes to the first sentence
of care of a article two section
thirteen because the court
wouldn't of looked at the eight
the voter's intent in nineteen
twelve the court would look to
the voters intent in ninety in
two thousand sixteen and we all
know in two thousand sixteen
capital offense means what the
legislature things that means
which is first degree murder.
So I'm here would have been
decided completely differently
under the interpretation that
the first part the first
sentence of article two section
thirteen is an exception to the
clear and convincing rural.
Your independent us and they
were interpreted in that way and
I'm here.
madam chair and Mr Grayson the
thank you all certainly take a
look at that the.
The court decision.
Probably sometime between now
and the sun moves forward of the
next committee but I I sincerely
appreciate your your to that
because that is really my
concern and and as bright as
there may be a thank you and
cry.
For us to change all right I
believe that we have to stick to
our constitutional our
constitution.
Even the good times bad times
not been shouting that whether
it's with respect to to
separation of powers issues or
anything else and so are I I
firmly believe that we have to
give first credence to the
constitution and then make sure
that our statutes aligned with
that and that's why raises
concerns.
Madam chair if I may I'd like to
go back to some of the
statements made by the more
Because madam chair as you have
heard and.
Have a kick me a timer to our in
these committee meetings as well
as an Judiciary.
I have.
Thank you.
The statements of the more just
maybe for for as long as I've
been up here.
We need to the.
In essence be tougher on crime
that we need to.
Have what I consider real
criminal justice reform yeah and
I I it was one of my.
Colleagues on the other side of
the aisle with the criminal
justice reform and in my part of
the state means something
entirely different than than in
the Albuquerque metro area
because it saves a criminal
justice reform for the past
number of years.
It is better to simply.
US slapped the rest of and and
turning back out on the streets
which is what I hear the more
saying is a concern here and I
certainly sympathize with with
the plight that Albuquerque
faces and certainly your
sympathize with victims of these
crimes and I know that we as a
legislative body got to get a
handle on on crime if we have
any reasonable expectation of
having economic growth and
having more prosperity for
citizens.
Yes businesses will not come to
a place where there is rampant
crime and and so I agree with
more on that for but but by my
questions are are.
That method to do without it and
and so I'm not sure that he was
so.
Next for appropriation Mr
Grayson in that regard.
I do think it's
House Bill five.
I still have a concern about how
it's laid out
you know it seems like we create
the presumption it seems like we
put the burden all the the fact
that but then at the very end
you side all we did meet at the
here and will.
James Burton group or whatever
I it it just doesn't seem like
there are but that's the way
this thing ought to be be
organized for the if that's the
how people view it and this for
the the district attorney is is
satisfied that passes
constitutional muster
I'm.
Almost certain that should this
bill become law.
There will be.
An opportunity for the courts to
weigh up all M. and that's a
concern so I think we as
legislators.
We need to make sure.
This legislation moves forward.
That we do everything.
In our power.
That we do everything that we
can possibly do.
To ensure that this piece the
legislature.
Passes constitutional muster
that is just not a compromise
between ideas because it was the
people of New Mexico would
change the constitution.
It was the people of New Mexico
to put into and to the
constitution of of this issue
and changed it of five or six
years ago.
And so I.
You know I have.
I don't want to quickly do
something to override the voice
of the people through the
constitution of through
legislative fiat lest we are
certain that what we are doing
is level one correct and number
two that it will pass that
constitutional muster and I'm
not.
I'm not a criminal defense
lawyer I'm not a criminal
prosecutor I'm not closely of
the not even closely a
constitutional lawyer but I can
tell you that it seems to me
that there's
no questions that Representative
jumped off the the pager B..
That it merits us having our
making sure that that some real
constitutional experts look at
this thing and can satisfy us
that it will cut that
constitutional muster if this
thing.
Makes it to the finish line
because it will be a challenge
it will be challenged and if we
are wrong it will cost the state
of New Mexico.
A lot of money and that will be
on us and so I certainly
encouraged madam chair the
representative
to seek out some some of those
constitutional experts make sure
before it gets Judiciary bank
sure that the you know what Mr
grace incense correct make sure
that the the maybe some other
constitutional experts are are
satisfied that the language that
appears in this bill.
Will pass constitutional muster
when this issue goes up to our
Supreme Court a few deer years
down the road yes this passes
about sprouts more bye bye we do
you
I I fully of.
This voted yesterday or the day
before for a constitutional
amendment on this very issue it
was defeated but I voted for it
because I think we have to do so
I I I I think we have to do
something to.
As the bears that are to be in
the catch and release or in
other the bachelor to stop the
revolving door of.
I'm there but I just want to
make certain that whatever we
do.
We do it within the
constitutional framework and
that it is.
Bullet proof when it goes before
the spring for so that we don't
find ourselves having to pay out
millions of dollars because we
made a mistake.
Thank you madam chair thank you
representative of thanks.
The experts for their testimony
thank you.
Thank you representative
Representative bangles.
I think at Chasey was gonna was
before me.
I'm sure I was but then I got
kicked off the new act on it.
And let's not.
Representative Gallegos do you
want to go or do you want me to
go to.
Representative I'd I'll ask a
few questions
We're.
The madam chair Representative
so I I understand and I I'm
hearing all the eight the
concerns I just wanted to talk a
little bit about stuff that's
going on I guess on the street
so what the the police
departments are seeing and with
the families of of crime are
experiencing in that's the piece
that I want to get to
what have been some of the steps
that have been taken to make
sure that that when there are
arrests done that we're that
individuals that have not
committed non violent or non
dangers
Kraft Heinz how would how would
they be treated are subject to
of pre trial trial detention
could you give me an example of
that.
Madam chair at Representative
Gaydos thank you for the
question and I would ask.
Our experts at commander deputy
commander heart's going to
answer that our hearts out sorry
I talked to ensure that please.
And you guys hear me okay.
All
right we're getting at.
Representative at your your
muted and we're getting some
feedback.
Can you hear me OK now.
Okay you can call me whatever
you want at your and thank you
for hearing for me today no it's
so low level offenders as are
going to be subject to this bill
and I can give an example last
week we charged five individuals
in connection with the murder of
Ryan to Bajor junior
three of or actively taking part
in the robbery that led to the
loss of his life two were in the
car but they were simply there
to get some of the drugs the
planned on stealing from the
drug deal that went wrong.
Persons in the back of the car
were not charged with murder
they wouldn't even be subject to
what this bill is going for the
three persons who fired the gun
sprayed mace and actually drove
the car to the event absolutely
were charged with the more
violent crime so that level of
children is already happening as
we work directly with
prosecutors in making the
charging decision police don't
want to see drug addicts locked
up or kept in jail anymore than
anyone on this meeting that but
we have to understand there's a
big difference of those persons
and are small but really
proficient group of violent
offenders are often committing
multiple violent crimes over and
over and over again before they
are ever intercepted by police
and put into the system.
Thank you madam chair and and
thank you for that do we have
any data that there any
particular crimes that are
repeated by eight by eight the
same individuals.
That and madam chair
Representative Gaydos again I
would as commander hard top to
ensure that.
You madam chairman guy goes
thank you for the question I
mean we we have so many case
examples that we could get you
in by the families in this room
and I'll tell you the stories
myself in our victim advocate
manager Terry where those have
that with thousands of families
of homicide victims and the
families come to us from all
around New Mexico and they share
the stories of their lost son
and daughter and what happened
and a question they always have
to us is one of the criminal
record of the person that you
think is involved in this is
that going to be charged with it
and it's always disappointing
answer to on because they all
have criminal records it's very
rare that someone just starting
off their their their criminal
justice track with a homicide
it's just it's so rare that it
happens what we need instead is
that they're passed by an axe or
absolutely protectors of their
future ones especially in the
short span of time even the
gentleman charge what the
massage mother murder the other
day was committing many armed
robberies but all led up to it
these things these crimes all
happened on the island they're
not one of the time they're
almost always serial offenders
and keeping them locked up
immediately after their arrests
they can't come out you can
continuing to do these crimes
that that's highly important the
last thing I kind of wanted to
answer a question about data but
the increase in violent crime
started several years ago and
the question any cop on the
street and an answer for you is
do we think that we have read
more violent criminals
proportionally in our society
answer is no that number has
stayed the same the population
has a really growing amount of
criminal having grown instead we
have been able to of all these
changes to the system over the
past several years the same
criminal no it's a joke they
know they can just come out and
keep doing these crimes over and
over you know how easy it is to
avoid detection of pre trial
services monitoring a probation
officers and even police keeping
certain violent criminals
incarcerated until they're try.
File it honestly one of the only
ways to keep the society.
Madam chair of with your
permission I'd also ask DPS
secretary Jason bow eight two of
and to that answer.
Madam chair representative thank
you for that opportunity really
do appreciate that first I guess
me once our office real quickly
spend within knowledge minutes
sounds like everybody really is
on the same page want to address
this issue there must be some
of.
Conflict as far as how do we get
there really pleased to hear
that people are coming together
to have this discussion and how
to you know address this matter
I think even going back to the
constitutional amendment of
twenty sixteen I think it will
well intended I think people at
that particular time I recognize
that some change was needed I
would suspect that analysis and
data at that particular time
likely support the initiative is
probably the the the driver for
change but in retrospect we must
be honest with ourselves without
five years now this experience
five years of this amendment to
evaluate if we miss sectors and
I think if we take an objective
assessment to determine if we've
been effective or not of this
well intended legislation and
and house we put into practice I
think if we're honest with
ourselves meeting we can agree
that that we're not seeing
desired outcome of your hearing
from every level of constituents
Forsman everyone alike is fed up
with crime and so I think we
need to really take a look at
that you know I try to figure
out what we can bring to the
table that addresses this issue
and speak from experience I was
with city Rio Rancho for for
twenty seven years of which
woman retired as a deputy chief
and I can tell you that of
almost immediately following the
amendment we start seeing a
change in the recidivism of our
criminals on our streets and and
we Rose better able to boast a
pretty low crime rate in the
city Rio Rancho comparative to
our neighbors our neighbors and
and you tremendous job down
there now trends chapter
challengers District different
demographic there but the
reality is that we start seeing
increasing crime even in our
city and in twenty nineteen when
we have the crime the metro
crime initiative a lot of people
the media has done that the
surge we don't like to refer to
it as such but our law
enforcement leaders were called
the to the capital to have a
meeting to discuss what was
needed in order to to have an
immediate impact and it was the
one of the drivers was that we
had a UNM students that was just
murdered and all offer.
For some leaders in the room
were unified in recognizing that
bill reform or the
constitutional amendment was a
serious issue and it was the
topic of discussion in large
part
the governor on the call stepped
in and said I understand we will
look at that we will address
those issues but I need
something done now any some done
immediately it and this is where
the the plan for the measure
prime minister came from but
we're here we are now we are
dressing issue we have a lot of
different bills that are
addressing this remarkable
presumption issue and I'm very
pleased to see that the people
are are having a discussion
because all communities as not
just the City of Albuquerque all
communities I've seen the impact
of this and and we need to come
together so I I I would hope
that we can be unified in this
effort I would just close with
this in that of the staff to
this addresses this this
particular bill they're very
serious crimes and like how are
stocks that.
People don't just also and one
day wake up Mr committing these
this violent offenses they've
been in the system a long period
of time you know just also
decide to wake up one day and
commit these horrendous felonies
but we're talk about serious
stuff here talk about murders
aggravated batteries for three
kidnapping the second degree six
percent degree robberies
aggravated arson she occupied
dwellings of assaults to commit
violent family fun police
officer these are serious years
offenses and I would think that
we would all stand behind how
dangerous these these people are
I think we can all agree that we
don't get people decide to
commit these crimes don't need
to be in our community in the
short term while we're trying to
figure out
you know what needs to be done
let's remember that probably
causes redness Stadler's judges
resign off on wards you know
loss that's already been taken
part of us getting to this
moment whether we decide this
person be released or not so I
am as a as a law enforcement
leader I would implore you to to
work together on this issue and
it to come up with a solution
without madam chair members the
committee thanks for minimal.
Thank you madam chair and
ankle bracelets how effective
has they've been and who is
required to wear them.
Madam chair representative
Gallegos thank you for the
question again I'd like to
deferred to
Commander.
Hi he just disappeared on my
screen there is our staff and
I believe in fact that he may
have been involved with the
investigation into the death of
angel Leary's of.
son that and we heard from her
last time it which I think
involve some issues regarding
the ankle bracelets if if I
remember correctly.
No.
For.
Keep reading of I'm gonna if
it's up okay I will step before
I give the command are something
that worked on this issue quite
extensively over the past year
and I have some information on.
Then
chair
I deferred to up at chief
Medina.
What.
Yup my name is our chief of
police for the City of
Albuquerque and Services has its
place there are cases where an
individual on a monitor is
appropriate.
The process before correcting of
the individuals need to be
monitored twenty four seven
hundred individuals I need to be
held accountable when they go
outside of that we also need to
point to work with us on this
one individual violation of
those rules there has to be
accountability the criminals
themselves I know that if
there's not accountability that
they're able to commit right
without anybody knowing well we
have a case one individual
committee eighty residential
burglaries and then we repeat
that eighty burglaries.
What I want to for every reason
for for a lot of reasons
property from vendor firsttime
arrest we can do that we asked
the person to be detained I will
not commence that this personal
re offend.
This person re opened it.
Committee another burglary and
the courts have refused to give
us the that GPS system and I
guarantee that there is other
cases the mercury the committed
but I will through all the
technology appreciate your
legislative your funding you're
from the state legislature to
see where this person committed
other crimes because the process
is broken.
Individuals who don't belong
ankle monitor anybody who's
shown the propensity of
violence.
Committed to crime with a
firearm.
One apprehension we from from
being a violent criminal in
these individuals a GPS monitor
is not appropriate for that's
why we're asking for this law so
that we can ensure that we keep
these people in custody.
And that there's consequences
for their actions.
Degree.
Criminals it's not appropriate
for the individual that this law
this this would affect.
Right.
We have to match the right tool
to the met life process is the
right price.
Right now yes monitoring is not
the answer for individuals were
violent.
One other thing I wanted to from
I don't want to focus on the
metro area in Albuquerque.
I don't know I was born in
recent House Mexico I have
family from Las Vegas how the
off screen more on the.
Every single one of my family
members are affected by crime
every single one of their
community.
Every single one is concerned
and sick and tired of the
revolving door.
I would appreciate from the four
corners affect New Mexico.
Every single one of the people
he still stayed with.
The second part of crime.
I and I talked to the chair of
the solution.
We're not on the same page when
it comes to the legislature we
all agreed on one thing the
number one issue that came up
with this how do we keep people
in.
And they see the concern also.
Everybody on this call.
Here today recognizes we need to
need action leaders sometimes
take action.
We take it without everything
being perfect.
Every day I make decisions when
I took over chief everybody why.
I
can create the capacity of our
detectives without doing it a
certain way.
I made a decision that I would
just have to recourse and you
may not be the best career
builder we got people worried
he's going to be and we're
starting to see the fruits of
that with the arrest of homicide
offenders that occurred in the
last ten days anybody who
follows the meeting is being
that.
There are free not being a
leader
this season.
I would never those processes
forward and we see that every
eight that's just a small
example of the tough decisions
leisure have to make an overview
on your shows their leadership
and knows that it may not be
perfect we'll do our very best
things are always in justice and
that's what we're doing
adjusting the process from the
past.
We'll continue to make those
adjustments.
Work quicker and do what's right
for the people of the City of
Albuquerque what and also the
state of New Mexico thank you.
Madam chair at thank you chief I
also though would like to W.
hearts Act if you could just
talk very briefly about his
experience with the affected us
of the ankle bracelet in the
killing of an angel and that is
in the situation surrounding the
killing of Angela Leri son.
Thank you chairman
Representative Matthews.
but I I actually went out to the
the the homicide in this case
where angel Fund tragically in
way too early losses life
once we discovered what possible
suspect was seven months for we
instantly start looking into it
background and quickly found
that the Bernalillo county
sheriff's department just a few
months prior had arrested him
for finally shooting a gun out
of his car window lately in
front of police officers near
downtown Albuquerque with
absolutely no regard for anyone
to take the including its owner
anyone living nearby other
motorists traffic the DA's
office did ask for him to be
detained based on this very
violent offense that is very
small percentage of our society
is willing to commit there's
very few of us are willing to
shoot a gun out our window in
downtown Albuquerque but you did
that he was released and his GPS
monitor with such a deterrent
that over the next four months
to continue to build drugs.
Require gun.
Our to have interpersonal
conflicts with other people that
were around ten until finally on
that date you will now in
someone's life with a shotgun
and on his ankle at the time was
a pre trial services GPS
monitor.
It's a complete lack of the
deterrent at all with violent
offenders the reality is once
they start doing this these acts
in that short span of time like
I talked about earlier nothing
is going to stop them except
literally taking them out of the
the place where they can commit
the crime
Representative corporation on it
even traveled a few miles in the
southeast Albuquerque then got
into a dispute with a random
person over a parking spot he
took that shot down any fired
again thankfully he missed her
and then he laughs.
Within the next thirty six hours
you can afford to commit
robberies until finally our
police officers on foot if he
throws the murder weapon and
it's finally physically taken
into custody.
But we have to wait to of all
these other crimes and the loss
of a life.
To get there.
GPS monitoring is not meant are
ideal for violent offenders and
even even when it is applied
there's no immediate.
Consequence to violating.
If I make a rule for my kid at
home not be candy for breakfast
and I simply never checked in on
how much the cannibal of getting
emptied are the factors rappers
all around the that is the when
I come downstairs what's the
point of the rule there has to
be immediate consequences pre
trial release should be this is
the zero tolerance for a
violation and should never be
for these violent offenders and
had he just been detained
initially enjoy would be sitting
at this table with us today.
Thank you.
Thank you madam chair and and
thank you Representative and
that's all I've got for now.
Thank you representative
Representative Chasey.
Thank you madam chair and thank
everybody or for being here
today.
For talking to us.
I feel very bad that it is to.
Here that those of us who have
concerns about this bill.
Don't want to solve the problem
for that we don't care.
I spent ten years up here and
that was just that was when I
started working on criminal
justice reform.
Because I want us to spend our
money wisely and to invest in
children and education instead
of having to build prisons so I
it's it's kind of heartbreaking
to.
Be perceived as not caring or
not seeking a solution.
I.
I will say everything today
we're going to destroy this
afternoon we're also going to
give an opportunity for the G.
H. talk to us.
Public defenders to talk to us
further identification of this
discussion.
In Judiciary Committee but.
We were talking about concerns.
And
Problems with the bill in
addition to the instance
that representative Nibert
raised.
One of the handouts we received
west.
Other states that have
rebuttable presumptions and one
of particularly was New Jersey
and so with Representative
Matthews said let's come back
and let me take this bill.
The table today and let's come
when we come back and.
Have a further discussion I was
hoping we might on a proposal on
setting up a system like New
Jersey.
Where they have.
I don't remember all the details
that representative Ely gave us
the other day but the in the
A very speedy trial
requirements.
And I suspect they probably have
enough funding.
For the prosecutors the defense
attorneys and the courts to meet
the speedy trial requirement
and to be.
Have a fairly limited number of
crimes where it was just
automatically
Foundation of detention.
I've heard a lot about the
federal system and how it's been
in operation since nineteen
eighty four and how
That should inform us as to
whether we can do this
constitutionally and safety wise
and so forth.
I did have an opportunity for a
discussion what that.
Was presented and there was a
federal defender there and what
she talked about was the
differences between our state
system and the federal system.
Our system the US attorneys and
the federal defenders the two
prosecutors and defense have.
A lower caseload that is common
here in our district courts.
One of the things that on this
particular defender explained is
this would this would get at
some of the dangerous Business
once released when the client is
approved for supervised release
in the federal system.
They go in front of a federal
magistrate.
There is a program for
supervision of release of that
individual the federal
magistrate has to approve the
plan it includes housing drug
testing behavioral health
services so it's quite a
different system.
When I want to know is how can
we help can we do that.
Instead of spending another
twenty two million dollars a
year incarcerated individuals
who may the ones who are
unlikely to do
to form our communities.
We put it into.
Those kinds of services really
giving the prosecutors the staff
they needed and the the public
defender's the staff they need
the law enforcement the staff
they need for investigation and
and the appropriation of the
pretrial detention motions so.
Really interested in in seeking
a solution it's based on data
and science and reality and.
Not.
Not just the perception.
That.
This is the answer to everything
that this is going to make us
safe.
I I worry about spending money
at the wrong end of the system
not that I don't want dangerous
people incarcerated I do.
My neighbors want to they want
to be able to call the police
and have them respond to and I
would want to be able to come
out and do an investigation.
So.
I want to.
The very best technology needs
if there is somebody on some
kind of monitoring system I
I don't want the situation to be
Well and is self defeating I
agree with my colleague from
Russell that we we don't want
people to be deterred from
moving to such a beautiful place
as New Mexico because of.
On this issue you know with the
metro crime initiative I
participated in New.
We were really trying to address
poverty addiction the collapse
of the building has the
behavioral health system that's
what we all did to get together
on and.
What we do to help.
I just hope that we actually
have a solution that is shows.
Well we were that is ignoring
the reality and the data that we
have now and I understand that
there are views that the
legislative finance committee
did not get all of the data they
needed the legislative finance
committee is open to.
Receiving.
Every piece of information that
it can.
I.
Do not support the bill as
written.
And yet I would like to try to
help solve the problem.
And I don't think we have begun
to do that yet.
I.
I find it.
So what ironic that the the
price tag for this and then the
the violence intervention
program actually I think has
great promise for
Interrupting the violence on our
streets recieves a tenth of what
it's of what the request is in
the budget so those are my
concerns and I hope that we can
Got to.
A situation where we can figure
out is there a way to have a
rebuttable presumption system.
That is.
It really makes a change and
doesn't spend money
unnecessarily for the wrong
things thank you madam chair.
Madam chair.
Representative Chasey respond
quickly now I'm we're gonna move
on to Representative Johnson
thank you Representative Chasey.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you Sanchez and everyone
listening I don't have a
question but I would like to
share my thoughts.
Around this issue as it pertains
to my community and McKinley
County.
I live in Gallup and
yes it is true our crime is
increasing in our city and our
county it continues to rise but.
I as as.
As a woman in my community I see
many prongs to this issue and I
agree with Representative Chasey
I think we need to work around
this revolving door in a
holistic approach.
Some of the things that are
happening in my community is
yes our Gallup police officers
are overwhelmed we're running
our vehicles into the ground our
police vehicles not only are
Gallup police officers but we
also have the state police and
like many we have and the Navajo
Nation police we have the
sheriff's department.
And we have jurisdiction issues
are within those communities are
thanking the county San Juan
County we have the human
trafficking within our
community.
And we also need an air County
jail at the turn of thirty six
million dollars.
We also have
The.
The issue with the we give our
state police races but then we
don't have our municipal city
police races so then we lose our
city police who we've finally
trained we've already we finally
get on a tenure track and then
we lose them to the state and
then we have to start over.
And then we have
You know we just have those
types of things we have
we have poor people I've I've
I've I've heard.
First hand from my constituents
the horrible from families and
staff the horrible conditions in
our correctional facilities
that's a concern so as a woman
I'm sitting here
because I see my community from
a bird's-eye view and I think
about all of these things that
we need to address as we
continue to work on this and I
agree with my colleague
Representative Chasey I would
rather build libraries and
educational facilities and
workforce industry and cultural
healing facilities you know
so I just wanted to express
myself I want to thank you maybe
we can get more money across the
board within law enforcement the
public defender the courts.
You know I look forward to
continuing to work on this.
Thank you madam chair for
allowing me to express myself.
Thank you Representative
Representative Gallegos.
I moved to pass.
We have a due pass motion from
Representative guy a goes.
Is there a second.
Madam chair all second.
And we have a second by
Representative Rehm before we go
to the vote vote I apologize for
my delay I was sent taxation and
revenue presenting a bill of
money but I just want to say
that you know this is a really
challenging issue I think for a
lot of as and it's great that
we've heard from so many folks
so I appreciate that and
receiving all of the information
is very important.
and and I think we have moved
bills along where we've said in
the past these bills aren't
perfect but the discussion is
great.
There's opportunity to improve
the bill so I hope that's what
happens because we all would
love to spend money on on other
issues and tackle
Other concerns of ours
especially within our own
communities but given the fact
of the matter in the situation
that we're in you know this is
something that I'm going to vote
for it because I think that we
need to continue the discussion
we need to address the crime
especially in Albuquerque.
And I've been hearing from folks
in my district that what like.
This issue to be addressed so
thanks to everyone for and
joining us and we will now have
the clerk to call the roll.
Representative Chasey no.
Representative Eli no.
Representative Banco yes.
Representative night Burt.
Yes.
Representative Ortez yes I'd
like to explain my vote.
Representative right.
Yes madam chair and I would like
to explain my boat.
Representative Zamora yes.
Madam vice chair Johnson.
Yes.
Representative Nibert.
Yes that I like to explain my
boat.
Madam chair blue.
Yes.
Session passes.
And I believe we will first
start off with Representative
Ortez to explain her vote.
Thank you madam chair thank you
members of the committee
Representative Matthews
I'm heartbroken I.
This is probably one of the
toughest votes I've ever had to
take it and I want to explain
that
I know there's crime all over
the state it's increasing and my
heart is breaking for the
mothers and fathers and feels
and yes I who are who are having
to grapple with the violent
death of their family members
I'm I think we should do
whatever we can to tackle it and
but but as a whole country we're
really dealing with historical
injustices including many of
those in the criminal justice
system and and for for me in my
district you know we're we're
dealing with you know what it
means to be a poor person and
person of color I think we
should be supporting investing
in in tackling the root causes
of crime you know more more
support for dealing with
historical traumas more support
for education better jobs like
that are meaningful and and
investing in a justice system
that deals with crime swiftly
and certainly you know as
Representative Ely mentioned
earlier so you know I I vote I
vote for this because I know we
have to do something and I
really look forward to the
debate in judiciary I will be
listening but it doesn't doesn't
feel great so thank you madam
chair and thank you members of
the committee for for listen to
that appreciate it.
Thank you Representative I
believe Representative Rehm was
next.
Thank you madam chair of the.
I don't for those who were at
the legislature when we pass the
original bail mon then that.
They probably remember my
statement and it was that this
didn't go far enough that we
would be back to fix it.
Since twenty seventeen I
introduce legislation to fix.
I think that it's become very
clear that
Of bills such as this will be
appealed I think the Supreme
Court will make a decision to
find it unconstitutional and so
I think the best fix is a
constitutional amendment where
we can fix it this fall and not
three years from now thank you
madam chair.
Thank you and I'm was it
representative Nibert.
Yes Representative great.
Matt Madam chair of as I stated
during the debate.
I am certainly willing to let
this measure.
Move forward to Judiciary where
we can have further debate I
will certainly read the case
that the Mr Grayson pointed to
but I would really of war the
sponsor of this legislation to
get a constitutional expert to
look at this way here and
possibly even consider whether
or not we need to go back to the
people with a constitutional
amendment to make certain that
it cuts constitutional muster
because I have some.
Real concerns as I expressed
with respect to to this piece of
legislation's constitutionality
under the New Mexico
constitution I'll look at the
case so I I still have those
issues but our our our voted to
allow to go on to the next
committee this is worthy of
debate it's right crisis our
state it has to be dealt with
the issue for me is how do we do
so in a manner that with will
withstand scrutiny from our
point thank you madam chair.
Thank you Representative and
Representative Matthews you do
have a due past thank you.
Madam chair members of the
committee thank you and thank
you for a informative and
interesting and very concerned
debate I think we all want to
see less crime there's no single
cause of crime there's no single
solution this is part of a
broader approach that is being
suggested in this.
Of this session of the
legislature and I think many of
us are in support of the full
range of.
Efforts being made to reduce
crime and improve public safety
so thank you very much for your
attention.
Your sports next we are moving
on to house joint resolution I.
Representative Dixon and
Representative Fajardo will you
please raise your hand.
As well as those that might be
experts we can move it over to
the panelists.
Representative Dixon.
You should be promoted
Representative Fajardo do you
have an expert.
Yes yes madam chair up Bob
pearls great.
Well promote him now and go
ahead and begin when you're
ready okay I thank you madam
chair and members of the
committee I'm here this morning
to present house joint
resolution I which is a
constitutional amendment that
would allow voters who have not
selected a party affiliation or
what we call declined to state
to vote in state sponsored and
state funded primary elections
of a political party.
We've seen over time an increase
in the number of voters who
register and while they may
align with they don't want to be
bound by major political party.
So here in New Mexico that's
just about three hundred
thousand voters and
predominantly younger voters
especially millennials.
Civic engagement is fundamental
to our democracy and I believe
it's important to encourage
voter participation.
I'd like to ask my co sponsor
representative Kelly Fajardo to
say a few words and then we'd
like to turn to our expert
witness Bob pearls for
additional comments thank you
madam chair.
Thank you madam chair thank you
members of the committee thank
you so much for your time this
morning I'm yeah I just want to
echo the words of of my co
sponsor the decline to state
voter is the fastest growing
voter that in New Mexico and
actually in New US history as
people are registering their
their determining that they
don't want to identify with the
part of the party that they want
to be part of the process so
what is happening is they are
they are not being allowed to be
part of the process when they
are denied the opportunity to be
involved in primaries this
allows especially the younger
the millennials to get more
involved to have a more active
that have active voiced and to
get involved in their to in
their democracy not about four
hi a loyalty but it needs to be
about voter loyalty given the
voter the opportunity to to
decide and kept they want
and so that's a great thing
about about this bill I look
forward to your questions and
I'll get back to my co sponsors.
Thank you madam chair maybe Mr
pearl's I'll be recognized.
Yes Mr girls.
Thank you madam chairman members
of the committee thank you
Representative Dixon of heart of
for being the prime Sanchez on
this legislation I'm Bob pearls
and a former state
representative and founder of
New Mexico open elections we
have about twelve thousand
people on our mailing list and
we found in the last several
years.
More more Americans and more
more New Mexicans are becoming
much more focused on election
reform issues democracy issues
fundamental fairness issues and
really this bill is about
fairness it's not really about
party politics it's about
allowing all qualified electors
all qualified voters to be able
to vote.
As the Sanchez mentioned twenty
five percent of New Mexicans
over three hundred thousand New
Mexicans are decline to state
voters I'm one of them I was a
Democrat when I was in the
legislature but I've been a
decline to state for some time
now thirty three percent of
Coloradans are independents
forty five percent of all
Americans are independents sixty
percent of millennials and
younger are independents so I
know a lot of us who have been
in partisan politics most of our
lives.
Continue to think about
Democrats and Republicans and
that there are a few of these
other miscellaneous people out
there miscellaneous voters but
in fact throughout America the
vast majority of well not the
vast but the majority of voters
now are actually unaffiliated
voters forty one states out of
fifty have an open primary of
some sort this is called a semi
open primary because it does not
allow Republicans to vote for
Democrats or Democrats to vote
for Republicans it's simple it
simply allows decline to state
voters which are the names we
give independent voters in this
state the right to choose a
Democrat or a Republican ballot
or another major party ballot
depending on who else qualified
as a major party.
I'm not sure if I can share a
screen if that's is that a
capability no by hopefully you
all have the graphic that my
group put together
I don't know if you guys have
seen the graphic but there's.
Rinne's and rads basically what
the graphic shows and I'm happy
to take questions if it brings
up any questions.
is it tries to reinforce the
difference between the public
and private election
what I was going to show you was
I noticed representative Nibert
for example on the previous
testimony quoting the
constitution article seven of
the New Mexico constitution
says.
Every person who is a qualified
elector pursuant to the
constitution and laws of the US
and the citizen their of shall
be qualified to vote in all
elections in New Mexico.
And if you look through the
constitution and try to find
work talks about political
parties.
It doesn't the U. S.
constitution doesn't talk about
parties The New Mexico
constitution doesn't talk about
political parties.
They are not embedded as a right
in any way of calling out
political parties and yet over
the last thirty forty fifty
years are statutes have more
more given political parties the
ability to run elections and so
I want to spend just a final
couple of minutes of my comments
kind of reinforcing the
difference between a public
collection in a private
election.
Because it really comes down to
this when you consider that
political parties are not called
out in in in any of our founding
documents if you think about in
H. O. a vote homeowners
association but.
That's clearly a private vote.
maybe a running club or a
bowling club you know you have a
certain number of people
involved in that club there's no
tax dollars there's no public
administration that's a private
election.
If you look at the political
parties and there's lots of the
U. S. Supreme Court decisions
that clearly called out the
political parties are private
entities they're not.
they're not public entities are
not governmental entities with a
Republican or Democratic Party
has an election they pay for
that election and it's run by
internal rules of that political
party.
now let's look at the primary
election it is a public
collection it's paid for by tax
dollars.
clerks are involved the
secretary of state's involved
and they're very clear rules and
regulations but again over the
last forty or fifty years
there've been there's been this
kind of encroachment of statute
that have allowed the political
parties to decide who can vote
in a public election so I just
want to kind of pull it back to
the fact that the constitution
calls out that every qualified
elector shall be able to vote in
every election primaries are
clearly a public election that
are taxpayer funded therefore it
seems pretty intuitive and forty
one other states have gotten to
this point to say that all
voters if they're registered
should be able to vote.
and I'll wrap up by saying I
know there've been a lot of
controversy ill election bills
run lately
you know same day voter
registration.
We already have that now in New
Mexico issues about whether
people should get mail in
ballots automatically all of
these kinds of discussions
are are really sort of much more
dramatic reforms than simply
letting your neighbor he's been
registered for thirty years
vote.
In a public election so I'll
wrap up with that thank you.
Thank you so we are going to
open up the whole if folks would
like to vote in favor or
opposition of house joint
resolution I the poll is now
open and will keep it open for
about thirty seconds and while
we're doing that for those folks
that are listening and
Here for house joint resolution
nine that bill has been rolled
per the request of the sponsor
so we will not be hearing house
joint resolution nine today.
And we will close the call now
and we have ten in support and
one in opposition so members of
the public that would like to
speak and support please raise
your hand and you will be
provided an opportunity to
speak.
Richard Mason you are and made
it.
Yes madam chair members the
committee my name is Dick Mason
I am sure the action committee
of the league of women voters of
New Mexico and I want to speak
in support of that eight staff I
I'm primary voting election
eligibility guidelines HB delay
decision is a supports an all
inclusive system of funding that
allows all registered voters
participate in primary elections
so that voters who are not
enrolled in a major party may
vote on a ballot at their
primary Adam without having to
enroll in a particular party so
they stand in support of a J. R.
I I RA only consideration as we
would like minor parties.
They've already should it yet as
a minor party be able to
participate also that that even
with that I'm missing the lady
to stand in strong support of HA
I I thank you.
Thank you Kathleen Burke you are
now and made it.
Good morning madam chair members
of the.
You my name is Kathleen Burke
I'm a registered Democrat in
Bernalillo county I am a member
of retake our democracy the
Adelante progressive caucus and
a member of the league of women
voters of New Mexico I also am
the vice president of New Mexico
open elections.
I want to amplify the comments
of Mr pearl's Representative
pearls and it's an add to that
that it it appears to me to be
quite unjust that.
Our members of our state to vote
as declined to state or
independence
or minor third parties are
required to pay for their taxes
excuse me are pay for primary
elections however they are
currently locked out from voting
in those elections and that's
one of my largest concerns on
this issue and and I feel like
like let's let's either make
away and allow them to vote
which this piece of legislation
does.
Or or let's have the parties
including my own party pay for
our own primaries.
So I'll leave it at that thank
you members and I ask for the
past please.
Thank you Jason Barker you are
now unmuted.
J. St you'll have to and then on
your end.
Okay well trying to get back to
Jason later
Can you hear me okay great we
can hear you okay.
Thank you madam chair I
apologize I wanted to start with
a quote from Thomas Jefferson we
in America do not have a
government by major we have a
government by the majority who
participate.
As a DTS voter I wish I could
participate in the elections and
I'm not able to.
And I think it's this is a
citizen.
Registering to vote and cast my
ballot that I would be engaging
in free speech.
So I therefore speak in support
of this bill and I ask for a do
pass thank you.
Thank you next we have Evelyn
Vinogradov you are now and it.
Thank you chairwoman and
committee for this opportunity
speak my name is Evelyn Bennett
grotto thank you for the correct
pronunciation of my name I
represent the D. PNM rural
caucus statewide and speak in
strong favor of this bill I
simply amplify the comments of
the previous speakers and thank
you for your support of H. J. R.
I.
Thank you.
Is there anyone that would like
to speak in opposition.
If you would like to speak in
opposition please raise your
hand.
And so.
No one has raised their hand we
will go to the committee
Representative Eli.
I thank you madam chair I'll be
quick
I've heard similar legislation
in the past without much success
so I'm hoping that with the
change of players are.
The the sponsors will have more
success than I do the EDD and so
I wish them the best of luck and
let's see how it goes but I
strongly support this measure
thank you madam chair and thank
you Sanchez for your courage in
bringing this.
Thank you Representative
Representative Nibert.
Thank you madam chair
So it's Mr pearl's mentioned by
prostitution I thought I better
read the constitution it says
more than what Mr Perot says.
There's everybody or every
person who is a qualified
elector percentage of the
constitutional laws of the
United States and so this in
their of shall be qualified to
vote in all elections in New
Mexico.
Subject to residency
registration requirements
provided by Los.
So it does provide that we can
find laws that deal with.
Registration requirements as we
are.
With respect to the.
with respect to the issue of.
Our folks not being able to vote
we've made it so easy for people
to change their registration and
change it back.
Maybe the example of money might
be five six seven year old uncle
who was declined to state and
before every primary key changes
registration day after the
primary changed it back simply
to vote for me.
The primary so so it's not the
it's not like they're not able
to it's just so that they would
would I don't want to have to to
change the registration to
participate in one party or the
other parties.
A primary process are without
the so those are my two comments
thank you madam chair.
Thank you Representative.
are there any other committee
members that would like to ask
questions.
What is the pleasure of the
committee.
Madam chairman would you pass
second that madam chair great we
have a due pass motion by
Representative Eli and a second
by Representative Chasey
I just want to thank the
sponsors for bringing this bill
I think it's really important to
allow everyone an opportunity
about and I do know that folks
are changing to DTS so I think
this is a great bill is there
any opposition to the past
motion.
Okay let's go ahead and the
clerk to call the roll place.
Yes.
Representative Ely yes.
Representative diagnose yes.
Representative Nibert
Representative Ortez yes.
Representative green.
No ma'am.
Representative Zamora no.
Madam chair Johnson.
Yes thank you.
Madam chair Lewis yes.
So you have a do pass on house
joint resolution I thank you
representatives thank you madam
chair and members of the
committee.
Thank you thanks so as I am
previously mentioned heard the
request of the sponsor we will
not be hearing house joint
resolution nine today so we will
now move on to house bill one
fourteen Representative Matthews
are you on if so would you
please raise your hand.
I see her listed as the only
Representative is there
someone else that is here for
Representative Matthews for
house bill one fourteen.
Representative Rubio are you.
On what is currently.
Okay I'm not seeing anyone let's
go head here she's madam chair
she's in the attendees okay.
I'm.
Great we will promote you now to
panelists so
We are will we'll be hearing
house memorial twenty six
welcome Representative Rubio.
Hi good morning everyone thank
you for having me on this
morning I was worried I wouldn't
get and so on thank you I'll be
very brief as this memorial is
pretty straight forward as many
of you know I've been working on
issues related to modernizing
our legislature for many years
now and this past year I've had
the great pleasure working with
eleven other legislators who we
were able to push some really
great broadband legislation last
year decided to work
collectively on this issue and
three of our top priorities is
not only researching and better
understanding of legislative
compensation but also looking at
the timing of our legislature
and what it would look like if
we had staff as well in in terms
of not only efficiency and
effectiveness as a legislature
but also bringing on a new
generation of of of legislators
who have lived experiences
around their communities and and
we think that this is an equity
issue that we must be addressing
and so this memorial basically
provides the funding to the
university of New Mexico to do a
study to basically tackle this
issue Representative joined
Garrett and I have committed our
legislative allocation of junior
money to pay for the study we
expect that the study if
approved goes on and and is done
so by UNM they'll give us
initial findings in August and
then again in December so that
we can come back in twenty
twenty three and address a lot
of their findings and then look
towards the future around what
that modernization looks like
through those three areas and
then perhaps depending on the
serving that's done with
legislators and what staff there
might be other findings that
that are discovered so.
So I would encourage you all to
supported again it is just a
study I know that there are some
conflicts with folks around
their appreciation for citizen
legislature their their
appreciation for for how we do
things in the state
unfortunately in my opinion I
feel like there is a direct
correlation between why we're at
the bottom of every list and I'm
our ineffectiveness as a state
as legislators I know that
there's discussion around how
the governor the role of the
governor has a lot of power this
I think is part of that
balancing act and figuring out
what that looks like moving
forward so that's pretty
straightforward in terms of the
memorial the Karen Lynch is my
expert she is
on the call if she can be
promoted to panelist but that is
if there's any technical
questions we're happy to answer
so with that madam chair thank
you all I'll I'll I'll I'll stop
now and and open it up for
questions.
Thank you Representative let's
go ahead and open the whole for
the public that would like to
vote in favor or in opposition
of house memorial twenty six and
we'll leave it open for thirty
seconds.
And if you're just tuning in
house joint resolution nine has
been rolled.
Okay we will go ahead and close
the vote and hundred percent and
support I folks in favor of
house memorial twenty six.
now we'll open it up to the
public for comment if you would
like to make a statement in
favor of house memorial twenty
six please raise your hand Dick
Mason you are now and muted.
Yes madam chair members the
committee may miss Mason I'm
sure the action committee of the
league of women voters of New
Mexico and the delay it settles
a long standing position in
support of a legislature.
We we we think it will.
you know the access to other are
the
You have to two people
who can't afford to run
otherwise it also I'm not a
legislature I don't think people
realize the commitment there is
on time with interim committees
meeting with constituents and
everything else it isn't just a
thirty day session
sixty day session and we also
the league also has a position
to look at ways we can make our
legislative process more
efficient and this study will
look at that with no you know no
sect conclusions so we stand
from support of this memorial in
order to pass.
Thank you Jason Barker you are
now I needed.
Thank you committee chair.
I stand in support of this
legislation I would really like
the sponsors of the memorial to
really consider amending in
adding the University of New
Mexico political science
department along with the New
Mexico State University
political science department I
think having some political
scientist examine what is going
on is the key rather than having
a business aspect approach to it
for example the thirty day sixty
day style that we do here in New
Mexico that means it takes two
and a half years for New Mexico
to equal one year of legislative
work done in Colorado so we need
to change that so we can get off
the bottom of all these ranking
list thank you.
Thank you Andrea Serrano you are
now and muted.
Good morning madam chair members
of the committee my name is
addressed on on the executive
director of a late based in
Albuquerque and we stand in
support of this memorial
absolutely believe that we need
to make a legislative process
accessible on all fronts
including who can hold office
currently everyday folks who
either don't have a flexible job
or who don't have and you know
disposable income aren't able to
run for office and I think that
studying this issue can can be
that first step toward creating
more race class and gender
equity in our state legislature
and for those reasons we stand
in support of this memorial and
thank the sponsors for bringing
it forward.
Thank you.
Is there anyone that would like
to speak in opposition of house
memorial twenty six.
Seeing none we will go to the
committee.
Representative Ortez.
Madam I moved to pass.
We have a deep has motion by
Representative Ortez.
I'll second that motion.
Is there any discussion.
Okay the clerk to call the roll
please.
Representative Chasey yes.
Representative Eli yes
Representative guide yes.
Representative night Burt
Representative Ortez yes.
Representative green no ma'am.
Representative Zamora no.
Madam vice chair Johnson.
Madam chair.
Yes.
Representative you have a do
pass on house memorial twenty
six thank you madam chair and
thank you Representative I was
really hoping to get

Thank you madam chair and
members of the committee

have some experts Jason Weaks.
Should be on should be promoted.
And that let's see here sorry
it's been kind of a busy morning
I Geral Act Lee from New Mexico
tech and.
Yeah we yes.
We're promoting everyone now
Representative you can go ahead
and began thank you madam chair
members of the committee H. B.
one one four is a bill it's is
also involves and that is a very
different way I'm trying to
improve our criminal justice
system and one of the barriers
to.
I'm.
Data that we need in order to
determine causes of crime and
best solutions and best
practices and so forth is the
ability of various different
agencies to share their data.
And this bill addresses that
problem and seeks to
obtained funding and to develop
the legal framework which would
allow data sharing without
violating privacy rights and the
other considerations is
apparently a very technical
field and would and requires a
good deal of expertise to put
these kinds of agreements
together and that's what this
bill is about.
Thank you Representative do you
want your experts to speak are
they here to answer technical
questions I would like
I certainly Jason Weaks to speak
and and then let's see if the
others need to are primarily
here for technical questions.
Okay Chasen.
You'll have to I mean on your
and.
Jason Weaks.
Well if he's not available maybe
we could go to add your ideas
because he's also with the
county.
Okay Mr DS.
Thank you madam chair
Representative Matthews
currently the effort in
Bernalillo county to acts for
data integration most criminal
justice system we are at a place
at a crossroads where we need to
gain more legal expertise and
knowledge in the way that we
explore how data relates to.
Our compliance these both
federal and state in particular
as it's concerned with CDS
HIPAA and see if see if our port
par forty two so in a nutshell
those three compliance fees I
have to do with criminal justice
data protected criminal justice
data protected health
information and also protected
data concerned with our
substance abuse treatment so
what we're what we're exploring
to do is to create a legal
framework so that our criminal
justice stakeholders and
partners can feel comfortable
with engaging in the process to
share their data
And clearly spell out
liabilities as far as risk is
concerned because right now that
some of the biggest questions
amongst criminal justice
partners and some of their
biggest concerns in so far
sharing data in that effort what
we are striving to do is to
provide high level curated
analytics to our stakeholders so
that they can make decisions
better and also explored the
efficacy of the programs that
are being implemented within the
criminal justice system while
also delivering very important
and very necessary operational
data to those individuals that
are out in the field making
contact with the public so that
when an individual is known to
the system we can have the
intelligence to understand where
they're at in their process not
only from a prior criminal
justice side but also from
mental and behavioral health
side so that we can properly
address and identify what the
resources are that we can get to
those individuals to help them
in their time of crisis at the
first point of contact.
So with this legal framework
what we see to do is to be able
to set that up so that the
criminal justice stakeholders
can safely and confidently
participate in that effort while
also setting up an architecture
that can be extrapolated to a
statewide level.
Great thank you we'll go ahead
and open up the call for members
of the public that would like to
vote in favor or in opposition
of house bill one fourteen and
we'll keep it open for about
thirty seconds.
And after we close the poll go
to those that would like to
speak in support of the bill so
if you want to speak in support
please raise your hand.
Okay so we have fifty fifty and
support and in opposition.
If you like to speak in support
please raise your hand.
Okay Adrienne Barboa you are now
and muted.
Thank you madam chair and
members of this committee my
name is Adrian but the
Bernalillo county district three
commissioner and current Lee
serving as chair of the
brilliant county commission I'm
thankful for our county experts
here to give the logistics and I
always like to bring in part of
the heart thank right part of
the reason why I ran for this
seat is because Bernalillo
county has such an important
role to play in how we see
behavioral health initiatives
criminal justice reform efforts
really make a difference in what
we are all seeking around public
health and safety community well
being I'm in this one year that
I've been able to serve district
three as the county commissioner
I have attended as many things
as I can around the behavioral
health initiative a criminal
justice reform efforts and one
of the huge is very years is how
are different entities can talk
to each other so that we can
really pick out which I'm sure
all of you legislators
understand that that is complex
right we have folks with co
occurring disorders we have new
drugs out on the street we are
talking about new ways of
and and we know the folks that
work for our front hand on the
ground that we heard from from
law enforcement to behavioral
health specialists say that they
can't they know what's going on
on the front lines and the data
sharing is prohibiting them all
from seeing it that don't work
on the front lines so I highly
support this bill I know our
County experts are here to give
the act I just wanted for folks
to have a picture of what it
means but we're trying to solve
and think about public safety P.
the lands of I'm really
resolving the behavioral health
and criminal justice efforts we
have going on right now so thank
you for listening to me and I
support this.
Thank you is there anyone that
would like to speak in
opposition.
Okay seeing and we will go to
the committee members
representative Ely.
Thank you madam chair so this is
a bill that I strongly support
I do think that one of the keys
to criminal justice is going to
be to break down the silos and
we saw actually that reference
to the FAA are
concerned are continue
with the district attorney's
office Bernalillo county is that
they don't share information as
we've just seen from the prior
balance on the difficulties that
LFC is had so I do think a
collaborative process is what's
gonna make sense everybody
working together to try and
tackle these now we're otherwise
very complex problems and I love
that it's right in the bill that
you're going to be sharing your
experiences with others similar
departments around the state I
do think even though Bernalillo
county is going to be the one
percent with most of the
problems lessons learned here
can be applied throughout the
state so I think it was well
thought out when I appreciate
the sponsor bringing it and I'm
fully supportive of thank you
madam chair thank you sponsor.
Thank you representative
Representative Nibert.
Thank you madam chair of.
Madam chair representative.
It is Bernalillo county or the
city of Albuquerque but this
that on there I see I the list.
Madam chair I I the defer to
either Jason or Jodi is to
respond to that.
Mr chair representative Nibert
this the Jason Weaks sars having
computer issues I'm doing this
through my phone
but yes data integration and and
moved moving forward with that
integration efforts and and the
development of both the legal
infrastructure as well as a
technical tools to do she did
better data sharing across the
criminal justice spectrum
between the partners with
something that was on the city's
metro crime initiative and it's
definitely on the counties
resolution of priority
initiatives that were pursuing
and we have actually had
conversations with the city
to try to engage in more
collective efforts relative to
what we view as the primary
problem which is formulation of
these data sharing agreements we
just don't have the legal
framework and that's the
impediment now do we might be
able to add a couple more points
there but the reality is and
they're all but the reality is
actually from the New Mexico
tech the reality is the
technical aspects of this are
not the challenges the legal
framework that is presently the
impediment challenge.
Thank you Representative Nibert.
The madam chair Mister weeks
asked someone else to wear here
so I was waiting for that I'm
sorry about that.
Then I think we're we're ready
for the next question.
Okay so no one else from way
okay so Madam chair
representative your it was on
there I see I. P. is this bill
drafted them so because you guys
couldn't get support for capital
outlay money for.
Madam chair representative
Nibert again I'll defer and to.
Egypt Jason rigs or eighty and
he may indicate somebody else
might be a better person to
answer this but.
Madam chair representative
Nibert
this really isn't well
positioned to do capital outlay
money because it's not a capital
project it's it's a service
based project so really not
eligible for capital outlay
good of an eligible for some
junior money we talked to some
folks about the junior process
but the idea is to try to get an
independent appropriation one
time appropriation
to to accomplish this
this project.
Well madam chair and and
Representative Mr weeks I would
disagree because.
Our county and city have have
come to us on occasion to
provide.
Planning dollars for setting up
thanks I mean it's not just
legal framework there's going to
have to be so some tangible
capital costs associated with
this our computer systems what
have you I mean you can easily
frame that within the context of
of and proprioceptive outlay
thing four hundred thousand
dollars for the Bernalillo
county representatives your is
is a drop in the bucket so I'm
I'm not even sure why we're
we're dealing side I I do I just
the
and kind of surprised and less.
The members representatives from
from Bernalillo county
and Senators champ the of find
four hundred thousand dollars to
fund this and and so that's on
the ice the IP and has made the
capital outlay of.
We're just why why are we even
look at it.
Madam chair I defer to that Mr
weeks.
Madam chair representative
Nibert I I and maybe I missed
mismanagement question earlier
it is a priority list but it's
not a capital outlay for any for
either the county or the city it
is a priority within the context
of the broader legislative
agendas
but but it is not a capital
outlay project nor do I think
the city north in the county
have pursued money capital
outlay money specifically to try
to do data integration based
projects we have done that
integration projects recently
but I do not believe that from
the standpoint of capital outlay
money we have ever sought
capital outlay money to do the
legal frameworks surrounding
that integration projects nor
have we sought money to do the
service based work required to
set up data sharing stories but
Joe we might be able to get into
that a little bit more in terms
of where the funding sources of
come from I know we've got money
from the sentencing commission
for that inauguration we get it
internally but I do since it's a
service more than it is any kind
of physical project.
We have not pursued capital
outlay funding for we have
decided to go the route of
getting money and house bill two
or either going through trying
to get your money.
Yes it is correct and funding we
haven't pursued capital outlay
we've been we've pursued grant
funding from the New Mexico
sensing Commission and internal
funding to this point.
Well we're just Representative
madam chair and representative
it strikes me as odd there are
the Bernalillo county and
Albuquerque
the delegation that's present in
this body can't do this without
having the bill the the.
We all have to consider because
the.
It this year yeah if the city
Rossel
and Travis county.
I thought this was important I
guarantee you they would be able
to think about doing a general
of bill to get the state to pay
for through general
appropriation act it would be a
request of the local legislators
to come up with money to fund
the study and then develop and
pay for the hardware associated
with the cost of of
accomplishing this and but I
would never even crossed our
mind that we go to the general
appropriations.
Of bills so.
I'm not going to be in favor of
it just because of of that and
and I think just maybe worthy
where the efforts but I think
the the representatives and
senators Albuquerque auda auda
allocate the you know they could
probably do a couple thousand
dollars apiece and come up with
four hundred thousand dollars or
snap.
so I with the.
I think they ought to for
students through other avenues
to the I see I do capital outlay
process thank you madam chair.
Thank you Representative.
What is the pleasure of the
committee.
Madam chair I moved to passed.
